191694778,english,0,1778820,"First time i post a review ever because i am baffled, i never seen devs so out of touch with the community...  New season dropped and they made every character into a braindead easy mix up machine without a single buff to defense, from the start of tekken 8 players where vocal about the prominess of easy mix ups and the glaring nerfs to defense compared to past tekken games and yet they do a huge patch with lots of new moves that enphasis on every aspect the players disliked about the game.  No one litterally no one asked for these changes, even new players never asked for more offense in a game that clearly lacks defensive options and is easy to mash button and win like in most Tekken games.  Tekken especially with competetive Tekken 7 scene garnered a reputation of a game that has solid focus on fundamental skill such as movement, neutral and defense and seeing how Tekken 8 nerfed all this aspects is sad, even the tournament views are worse for T8 compared to T7 for how homoginized the characters are and streamlined the gameplay is with new systems.  But i still had hope since things could change for the better. however devs turning a deaf ear on their community that was extremly vocal about all te negative aspects of the game which made the experience worse just to double down on what everyone hates for some fabricated notion that ""it's good for new players"" is incomprehensible when people loved Tekken 7 which was massively succesful for a fighting game."
191720018,english,0,1778820,"I do not recommend Tekken 8 season 2 for these reasons.  -The developers do not understand the characters they design. They see that the character has strengths and weaknesses and continue to not let them have this weakness. Instead, they homogenize the character to be like the others making them overtuned. This was a big issue in Season 1 that made 70% of the roster oppressive. And the game is suppose to favor the aggressor, but it favored the aggressor too much to the point where it will look like a one player game sometimes. There is very little counterplay to these characters. =Season 2 did not address these things, they only made minor defensive changes like being able to side step from crouch and side step buffer. But that is not enough as they decided to buff almost everyone while giving them major/minor nerfs. However, this isn't the only thing that makes it bad. They also killed character identities like Law's WS4 CH DSS not being a thing anymore, Zafina stances, Feng Wei snake dash block, etc. They gave characters like Dragunov some more identity which is cool, but no character should have their identity being killed or overtuned. All they did was buff the weaknesses of each character instead of just letting them have this weakness and just buff their strength instead. But the developers do not understand their character designs. -The developers also did not address any of the dumb tracking some of the moves have like the heat bursts. Yes, some of the Heat bursts like Bryans still track even though they aren't suppose to.  Also removing CH Ki charge is the worse change I've ever seen. No one complained about it and people liked it."

191130721,english,0,1778820,"""For Season 2, we'd like to focus on defense in terms of the lateral aspects of a 3d fighting game.""   Followed by the developers spending over two hours without mentioning any defensive changes and only focusing on more BS 50/50 casino gameplay is hilarious.   Oh right, some genius decided that you should be punished for breaking a throw correctly and take chip damage.   Would not recommend anyone purchasing this game until they actually improve defense/movement to counteract the constant aggression.   [b]EDIT:[/b] Just wanted to add some extra feedback in case the developers become truthful when it comes to taking feedback.  1. Remove Chip Damage completely: Its a garbage mechanic and makes being on the receiving end of heat even more frustrating because even if you block the mix-ups correctly you're still punished enough to where you'll often lose 40% of your life bar from just chip damage and be put in range to where the next mix up will kill you.  2. Buff Movement: Backdash needs to be buffed to bait and create whiffs otherwise Tekken turns into everyone just constant throwing out hitboxes without thinking knowing that at worst they will hit on block and often times be plus still. Sidesteps need tuning to be more reliable since they can fail even if using them in the same situation as one in which they've succeeded previously.  3. Fix Phantom hitboxes/Nerf range of moves/Nerf homing moves/Remove string realignment GLOBALLY: All of these changes will also help with the problem above. People would play a lot slower in neutral which builds tension, makes a defensive more viable and allows there to be more neutral interactions instead of each player trying to bulldoze their way into constantly being in close range forcing a guessing game.  4.Severely nerf heat: I would love to just remove it completely but its already built into the core Tekken system. Instead just make it so that heat is something you have to earn in a game and make it so that once you activate it the meter never stops going down. Remove the ability to regenerate heat from moves/stances. Nerf Heat smashes across the board so that they don't cause stage interactions or wall splat. Heat smashes being so overbearingly strong streamlines a lot of the game play especially against characters like Jin/Heihachi. I would make every heat smash +3 or less on block since even when you block such powerful moves correctly you have to guess again for your life with another unfair mix-up.  5.Lower the plus frames on moves across the board, +5 is crazy for heat dash considering its not even something you have to earn to be able to do when you have heat active. There are also too many high reward moves that are also +6 on block or higher... Why?  6. Remove Unbreakable grabs and guard breaks from the game. They are just way too powerful and mentally taxing to deal with. Guard breaks also often lead to wall splats or wall blasts which makes them low risk for too high of a reward."
191738401,english,0,1778820,"To preface this - it's currently the launch of season 2 of Tekken 8. I like Tekken, I've played Tekken since Tekken 2. I've played every Tekken game to date. I like this franchise so much that I've spent energy following it and playing it over the course of my life.  This game is quite possibly the worst Tekken game I have ever played. I would consider Death by Degrees to be more true to form to Tekken's formula and aesthetic than this game.   You can see right now I have hundreds of hours in this game, you might be asking why? If you don't like it - why spend so much time. Here's why - I have desperately tried to cling onto the idea that if I played enough/ranked up enough it would suddenly click. I've also always liked Tekken and didn't want to drop a franchise I've historically enjoyed so I thought I was missing something.  I wasn't and that point has been proven now.  Tekken 8 was given out to players initially as a review copy without a battle pass addition. Once official release came around a battle pass was added to bypass the review phase. This battle pass and each one afterwards till now contains items which were normally obtained in Tekken games through in-game currency obtained from Online Matches or Arcade mode or even other party modes added in previous games such as Tekken Bowling or Tekken Volleyball.  However with Tekken 8 this was a unwelcome surprise and now it requires real world money.  This is why Tekken 8 now has a asterisk with the message ""This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity"".  This is not one of those times.  With the launch of season 2 they emphasised that the updates would favour defence options a bit more. Currently plus frames are rampant with many moves or heat activations which leave no room at all for you to retaliate and certain characters are utterly broken. I don't mean overpowered either but they have them too.  Paul can currently do f,1+2 into while standing 3 and it will bypass the guarding system and hit every time. To go even further, he can press 2 after that unblockable ws,3 and if you're at the wall, you just got wall splat. Which will possibly lead to you losing the match because you anticipated the move coming and blocked like a normal sane individual (You shouldn't have done that).  There is a plethora of similar issues with the game right now. There are many reasons the game is in the state that it is in but it comes to who's currently in charge. This narrows down to Kouhei Ikeda now being game director and Harada becoming an adviser. All ""heat"" on this issue is directed towards Harada who is sun setting his time with Tekken. All positive notes to take from T8 will be accredited to Ikeda's work on the game. All drawbacks will be learned from for the next game hopefully but ultimately it's Ikeda's series now. Many Soul Calibur developers have transitioned to Tekkens development.  That is the state of Tekken 8's development right now.  There is a bunch of issues why the game is not good right now: Too many plus frames. No actual defensive options. Terrible Heat mechanic. Many moves hitting off axis. Combo damage is incredibly high. Too many stance transitions (Everyone is Lei now apparently). Stock/State Power ups. Chip Damage.  The aesthetic of the previous games' are also lost entirely. T4 still holds the bar for the best with so little to show for it. They only needed a hint of flashy stuff or ridiculous concepts in Tekken. If you look at Clive you can see that's been thrown out the window.  What's also really disappointing is that a lot of players have tried putting the thought into peoples head that previous Tekken games were worse and they don't have the stomach to actually say the series got worse.  It's a really funny twist of fate that Tekken Tag Tournament 2 didn't kill Tekken but Tekken 8 - their most lavish and expensive title to date is doing a better job than Tag 2 ever did."
176380005,english,0,1778820,"The game has potential, but the tekken team is too busy implementing greedy predatory monitization practices on a FULL PRICED game instead of focusing on content, balancing and netcode."
175189454,english,0,1778820,"I have loved Tekken since I was a kid, LOVE this game and its core concept but the shady monetization in this game is just grimy and feels gross on a  $69.99 price tag. The inconsistent patch notes, this game has become Dragunov simulator, EVERY time you get to a promotion match they DC and they get 0 punishment for it. This is not the Tekken we deserve...its the Tekken we got...."
179502103,english,0,1778820,"It's a great fighting game however I hate the monetization. You pay for the game, there's a battle pass (only cosmetics), additional cosmetics on top of that, and then the worst part. You make the game incredibly knowledge based and then add DLC characters that in all honesty don't seem OP but you can't practice the match-up without owning that DLC. Very lame behavior"

191789523,english,0,1778820,"After 30 years of playing Tekken, I have never been as disappointed as I am with Tekken 8 – Season 2. This patch is a complete disaster that destroys the very essence of the game.  A chaotic gameplay experience The developers have completely shattered the game’s balance by making offense far too powerful. The game has turned into a mindless rushdown fest where defense, once a core pillar of the series, has become unnecessarily difficult. Reacting now requires an absurd mix of inhuman reflexes, encyclopedic knowledge, and lightning-fast analysis. Even worse, the game has become a never-ending lottery, a simple rock-paper-scissors match where luck outweighs technical skill. Every interaction feels like a gamble, making the experience frustrating and unbearable.  A disastrous development direction The decision to bring in SoulCalibur developers was a fatal mistake. Tekken is not SoulCalibur, and trying to force mechanics from a completely different game into Tekken’s system betrays the very DNA of the franchise. Harada and his team seem to have lost sight of what made Tekken a true fighting game masterpiece.  An outrageous price tag As if things weren’t bad enough, Bandai Namco is charging €40 for this mess! This price is absolutely ridiculous for a patch that turns Tekken into a game of pure luck. At this rate, I’d rather spend my money at the slot machines at the carnival—at least there, I know I’m gambling from the start.  An ultimatum for Tekken If this patch isn’t fixed soon, I’m done with Tekken. This is no longer the game I’ve known and loved for three decades. In its current state, it’s unplayable and no longer worth my time.  Bandai Namco, fix this before it’s too late!"
170583732,english,0,1778820,"The game is honestly amazing in terms of the gameplay (especially after the 1.05 balance patch), but the main issue with the game is how they handled the monetization. DLC characters were fine because I was only going to play one or two characters so I didn't really mind not owning each character. But there is a big problem, you can't use the DLC characters in training, and you are unable to view the replays of a match against a DLC character (if you don't own the character). You legitimately have to PAY to learn the matchups against these characters, which is honestly disgusting. I don't really care about the tekken coins stuff because all you can do is buy cosmetics with them, so that doesn't really bother me, but it is really scummy to add ""V-Bucks"" to a $90 CDN game a few months after launch. The game is flawed with a really fun gameplay loop but ruined by terrible monetization choices."
185618546,english,1,1778820,"I'm still pretty new to fighting games beyond stuff like Smash, but this is one of the sickest multiplayer experiences I've had in a long long time. I suck absolute ass but I don't feel frustrated because of just how fun the game is."
190287418,english,1,1778820,"Tekken 8 is a great game. The story was fine and short, but the cinematic was amazing and stunning. It was weird when the characters talk each other in different languages. How do they understand each other in different languages? The arcade story was fine. The character stories was fine, it just beat 5 opponents to get a cinematic cutscenes. Some of few characters do have a funny cinematic cutscenes. The gameplay is great. I do like the combat system in this game. The combat animations were fast and smooth, making every fight feel incredibly dynamic. It's different from Tekken 7 like the heat system wasn't in older Tekken games. The graphics and the character models were stunning. The music in this game was so good and banger. I do love fanart in gallery. They are talented and amazing. I do having fun to play online mode and friends. I do enjoy this game and it was fun. 8/10"
191688577,english,0,1778820,"I cannot recommend the game, after the S2 patch dropped. I am a Tekken veteran and I can assure you: This game is close to Guilty Gear Strive than Tekken 7/6 etc.  With the new S2 patch now every character got buffed, from an already to bloated and crazy standard. Basically everyone upgraded from a machine gun to a tactical nuke. The game is and will be so pressure and 50/50 focused, that you won't have fun as a defender.  Legacy stuff, like ki-charge and manual teching (backroll tech) have been removed, completely altering the gameplay and simplefying it.  As a through-and-through Tekken fan:  THIS GAME WILL MAKE ME DROP IT IN THE NEXT 7 DAYS! I urge every Tekken fan to give a negative review and minimize gameplay in order to give them a heavy hit, otherwise things won't change.  I hope I can prevent any old Tekken Fan from buying this game. It isn't worth it; at most as a casual and even then you won't have fun being stomped by your opponents.  Do better Team Tekken!"
173335493,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8, while undeniably more accessible than its predecessors, has stripped away much of the tactical depth that defined the series. The game feels like it's been simplified to cater to a larger player base, but at the cost of what made Tekken unique. What we're left with is a game that's largely about 50/50 situations, with little room for the nuanced, defensive play that even 2D fighting games manage to preserve.  One of the biggest disappointments for me is how defense is not only unrewarded but outright punished, particularly with the introduction of chip damage. In other fighting games, there are defensive tools to counterbalance aggressive play, but in Tekken 8, it feels like the game is designed to reward the player who can memorize the best combos and apply pressure non-stop. The Ranked matches exacerbate this issue, becoming a toxic experience where opponents either quit after one match, have unbearable lag, or exhibit other frustrating behaviors.  After over 100 hours of trying to give this game a chance, I've lost the drive to continue. I might revisit it if Kunimitsu is reintroduced, but for now, Tekken 8 is getting uninstalled. I'm finding more satisfaction in games like Guilty Gear Strive or Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, where my efforts in practicing hit confirms are actually rewarded, unlike in Tekken 8, where any attempt at analysis seems to get me punished anyway.  The final straw for me is the Battle Pass system, which feels even more intrusive and unpleasant in Tekken 8 than in Rising. It's a feature I genuinely dislike and it only adds to my overall disappointment with the game."
168485587,english,0,1778820,"I am going to refund this game. I payed for Ultimate Edition, thinking I will obviously have access to everything the game have to offer right? WRONG! There's still lots of customization that are locked behind, sit down for this one, in-game real money purchases! I payed for ultimate edition and they STILL don't even give you all the content for it, disgusting! I'm sticking to my TEKKEN 7 thank you very much."
169651406,english,0,1778820,"There will be always be 50/50s in fighting games, but the keyword here is 'forced'—forced by the universal mechanic, not by the unique characters or player agency over them. When you factor in those heat interactions over all the sets, it becomes a core mechanic that decides the outcome of the match. It's as if it 'fills the entire game,' like an anchor point, and the characters' unique styles and stances take a back seat. The matches are way too fast and aggresive for any deliberate play.  Bottom line is, I hate the heat mechanic itself and want it gone. Heat engagers break momentum (like those long goddamn rage arts were not enough), push the other player to the wall, and force you to guess. Yes, it gives you a chance to redeem a mistake, but it's like the game is forcing me to play a certain way that I never asked for. I also have to use my heat, be aggressive, and win that one interaction or avoid losing to it, or the other player will force me to the wall. This was not the case in T7, as you could only do that with good reads and combo execution, not absurd pushbacks. T7 was also very good in terms of balance in season 5. Yes devs are 'fixing' the game but the game itself is the problem. They just want the fights to look good on streams and tournaments; hence heat, but they killed defense now there's no  turtle syle , baiting etc you just cant do it and there's no incentives its just mash mash heat engager  heat smash  forward momentum mash mash. I play when I can but I don't enjoy it as much as tekken 7, strangely it doesnt even feel good to win as its more mentally draining than fun imo. Maybe that just me idk."
176364038,english,0,1778820,"Probably the easiest and most aggressive entry in the series, Tekken 8 has solid features but is marred by scummy monetization policies. It feels like I'm playing a free-to-play, gacha game anytime there is a new update. Miss the latest DLC character? The main menu will remind you constantly of their presence, with the in-game store taking priority over the ""real"" menu, forcing you to navigate around it. This is unfortunate in a cheaper game, but understandable. It's unforgivable when the base cost is 70 USD, and another 40 for a ""character pass"" that includes 4 characters and nothing else.   More concerning is the way Bandai Namco handled this. The Tekken Team has always said one thing and done another regarding these policies. Murray and Harada were on record saying there would be no in-game store, battle pass, or loot boxes. But without fail, all of these things have come to pass. The only caveat is potentially the loot boxes -- the asset is currently being used to advertise bundled costume packages -- but give it time. Recently, Heihachi's stage was sold separately from his DLC -- a departure from Tekken 7's season pass, and the community has been up-in-arms over this. But I feel the Heihachi stage drama is  just a figurehead for a larger discontent that the community feels over constantly being asked to pay more and more for things that used to be free.   The game needs a change in direction ala No Man's Sky at this point to right the ship. There's too much negativity surrounding it, and Bandai Namco need to re-establish good will with their players. That's the only apology worth anything."
191694070,english,0,1778820,"Ill start off by saying i love Tekken and i don't want to see it fail. That being said if you are someone who, like me wanted to pick up Tekken because you saw the intricate movement, whiff punishment and defensive prowess of JDCR and you wanted to work towards that level then i have bad news for you. That is not this game. Tekken 8 went in a different direction, once you get past all the knowledge checks what you are left with in this game is an overabundance of canned mixups, oppressive frames and in general very few options to move around in 3 dimensions or play defensively. This isn't coming from a jaded legacy player either, my first Tekken was Tekken 7 and i have to say Tekken 8 has mostly moved away from what made me fall in love with it in the first place.  TLDR: I don't think this game is worth taking seriously as a competitive game. If you just wanna play it for shits casually it will probably be fun."
185237105,english,0,1778820,"Gameplay wise, it's nothing compared to previous Tekken games, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's designed to be more accessible, which is good, but the price for casual interest is very high. It's just a completely different game—one that rewards mindless offense and punishes defensive play styles, forcing players to just run at each other all the time.  If you're to play this game, understand that you'll get tons of games where you'll lose 70+% of your HP not because you played poorly, but simply because you guessed incorrectly. If someone with 5 hours can luck into a win against a higher-ranked player simply because that player guessed incorrectly, then we have a problem. Also understand that this version of Tekken is no longer a martial arts fighting game—expect to see and fight against guns, laser beams, dragons, Ifrit, and a lot more anime-looking stuff. If you just want down-to-earth martial arts, then maybe just wait for the new VF game 🤷🏽.  And oh, I'm not even gonna talk about the whole DLC mess (releasing the shop months after release to avoid bad reviews, putting legacy characters (and a stage) behind a paywall, etc. There's already a lot of reviews about that, here and on other platforms."
191850184,english,0,1778820,"As a player with over 3500 hours in Tekken 7 I was very excited to see what the next entry in the series would be. My review is being written as of Day 3 of Season 2.  [h2] Network and PC performance [/h2] When the game released on PC it still had performance and network issues that were reported in the network test. As a user with a custom build machine that is tuned well and can play all the latest games on highest settings Tekken 8 still has performance issues at times. Every time I am on the character select screen the game will become slightly choppy when swapping and selecting characters. The game can sometimes crash on PC. Users that played Tekken 7 on PC will remember if you would alt tab there was a chance the game would crash. This is still on ongoing issue with Tekken 8.  Regarding net code issues, it still feels like Tekken 7 season 4. I am not a developer so I do not know what can be done to improve the net code but it is sad to see a fighting game release in the year that it did (2024) and have such poor net code when other titles like street fighter 6 and guilty gear strive have phenomenal roll back net code.   [h2] Presentation + content [/h2] The costume redesigns the characters received are a warm welcome and do a lot for the returning cast. The music and stages in the game are brilliant. Tekken 8 honestly has one of my favourite soundtracks in the series. I was really looking forward to the story mode as I was invested in seeing what happened after the ending of Tekken 7. The story mode was brilliant and is easily my favourite one iv played in a fighting game. Hopefully we can see a big follow up during a DLC release for Tekken 8.  Customisation is cool and I hope it continues to see free updates over time. The jukebox features is something I always wanted for PC users so it's nice to see us finally get it after missing out on it being a PS4 exclusive for Tekken 7.  I do wish there was more game modes available to play. For example having Team battle come back from the older entries would be really fun for offline play with friends or online in private lobbies.  [h2] Gameplay [/h2] This entry is very rewarding for aggressive play. The new heat system promotes players to stay on the offensive rather than  using movement and blocking to counter play their opponent.  With the new chip system you are punished for blocking and trying to play slowly to get into a better position. This is a huge change in the direction from the previous entry (Tekken 7) where you could use that games movement system to block and take your time to get out of situations. Since Tekken Tag tournament 1 (1999) players have been using movement (Korean back dash cancelling + sidestepping) to avoid these guessing situations and create whiff opportunities however with Tekken 8 having nerfed movement  (With season 2 they have buffed side steps which is nice but back dash cancelling still feels horrible) you will find yourself at times being forced to guess on a 50/50.  I think some of the hit effects are too much. When Clive activates heat and starts doing through his moves it really takes away from the fight and is too distracting.   Every member of the roster got some new tools coming into Tekken 8.  Characters have new single hit and combo strings to change how their game play looks and feels. Some users may find characters play vastly different than their previous entries (Jack-8) is a great example of this.  I think it is important that characters feel unique and have clear defined strengths and weaknesses. I am unsure what approach the developer team are taking with Tekken 8. But it feels to me that characters are starting to feel similar and lose their identity which is a first for a series that has so many unique and interesting characters. Take King for example. Does he need to have the best counter hit string in the game (DF+2,1) which you can hit confirm for a full combo? This does not make sense to me. As a wrestler type character he should be more focused on doing big single hits and using his cool chain throws.   There are currently 14 characters in the game with the guard break mechanic (Bryan, Clive, Devil Jin, Feng, Heihachi, jack, Kuma, Lidia, Panda, Paul, Reina, Shaheen, Steve, Yoshimitsu) which will break through your block and guarantee a follow up vs you.  In Tekkn 7 only two characters had this functionality (Lidia and Fahkumram) with Bryan also has a unique version of this mechanic since Tekken 3 (Taunt). Seeing it become such a normal part of the game really has made it no longer feel special.   With the latest update to the game (Season 2) we were expecting the developers to tone down how aggressive the game is and show us what defensive options they were working on. Since the latest patch characters across the board have become even stronger and more oppressive. More characters have access to 100+ dmg combos without rage and new tools to force you to block and guess on a 50/50 as you cannot use movement to escape situations. Chip damage is still a massive issue and heat lasts for too long when activated.  There are also currently some game breaking bugs from characters such as jack and Paul that have new moves that seem to have slipped past testing and are causing interactions that were not intended. It being only day 3 of season 2 more bugs could be found in the coming days/weeks. Hopefully we get an emergency patch to fix them.  [h2] Closing thoughts [/h2]  I am not sure what the future holds for the game.    I feel like Bandai Namco have been developing Tekken 8 to be enjoyable for the user on the attack without thinking how does it feel to be the user on the defending side.  Just because being on the offensive feels good doesn't mean being on the defending side has to feel bad. But with the core systems in place for Tekken 8 that is exactly how the game feels. From speaking with casual and pro players it does not seem that either group is happy with the direction the game is going.   I think the developers have lost sight of what made Tekken so much fun. It wasn't big flashy hit effects, over powered moves, characters having no defined weaknesses.  [list] [*] It was the unique characters and their specifics strengths. [*] It was seeing someone put years into a character and mastering what their specific game plan was and aspiring to be that great. [*] It was being a new player and seeing a clip of someone moving around the screen fast thinking ""Wow how are they moving like that??"". [*] It was the people who took the time out of their day to host online and offline events just for people to show up and play their favourite fighting game. [*] It was seeing people coming together from different countries to compete and change their lives [/list]  [b] It was the community.[/b]  And right now it feels like the developers are no longer listening to the community.  You can do as many collaborations and have as many guest characters as you want. If no one is around to play the game who will purchase the future dlcs you make?  I am lucky enough that I have a healthy offline scene of cool people who play for fun and want to improve. I hope the developers can open up a bit more with the community and maybe reach out for more feedback on future patches or ideas they have.  Everybody who purchased Tekken 8 loves the series. We just want to see it go in a different direction than the current one.  All the best   o/"
191985909,english,1,1778820,Devs teach people to block by blocking anyone whining about their game. Community's opinion is treated like shit and goes right into the toilet. They try to add nonsense flashy shits instead of stabilizing it. And it works like every piece of code comes from a different competing team. YES it's a fckn hackathon.
168337995,english,0,1778820,"Despite all the 5 balance patches, the game is a complete mess. Granted it is better than it was at launch, but the amount of busted op moves is still insane. So few characters have well defined strengths and weakness. Its just a case of find your 3 op moves on that character, spam the crap out of them. Defence does not matter anymore, side stepping is so weak, so many moves have insane plus frames and give 100% follow ups. I loved t7, and was so excited for t8 but this game isnt fun.

192049829,english,0,1778820,"💀 1,100+ hours to end up with season 2. I've played this game almost every day since release. I loved Tekken 8. It wasn’t perfect, but it felt like high speed chess especially for someone new to fighting games. Now? It's overly aggressive, and most matches feel like coin flips thanks to constant 50/50s.  -Damage is completely out of control  -Pressure is nonstop. Defense gets punished harder than offense  -Some characters straight up feel like final bosses  -It’s so offense heavy I feel like I lose just for trying to KBD  Until they fix the balance and bring back some defense, I’m tapping out of ranked. Maybe even the game entirely. This was my favorite game. :(  (Yes, I'm writing this after an unholy loss streak. Let me cope.)"
165228643,english,0,1778820,"Disappointing is an understatement when it comes to Tekken 8.   This game I will admit I was hyped. Seeing the game play and all the crazy stuff they added looked interesting. Oh boy I was wrong. This game is just a party game that gives anyone a chance to win. You could outplay someone 9-1 but you have to remember the opponent has that 1 and they destroy you because they press their special win button (heat). Heat is a pretty big problem, the single player mechanic it gives isn't fun. I hope they balance heat out but we will see in the future.   I've played ranked for at least 150 hrs getting to the top ranks and I can tell you that ranked and the online play is flawed in many ways. The ranking system is really bad, if you get demoted you have a chance to get that rank back again. It isn't like Tekken 7 when you get demoted you get sent all the way back. But I think this is more for the casual gamer so they don't get demoralised which I understand but why allow it for high ranks? Don't get me started with the plugging (rage quitting) that comes with this game. 7/10 matches you will get a rage quit because the bans are manual from their end. The ban system is really whack, I could hop on like Fariborz or LawofEngland with my macros and not get punished for it. Even if I get banned I can use family share to hop onto another account.   Tekken shop is a disaster, I love getting costumes that modders themselves put into the game for free. The devs had the audacity to screw them over by DMCAing them all so they had to take their mods down. Also the devs have made it super clear they really want to focus on the Tekken shop for obvious reasons because it is their second hand income.   I will change this review when things get fixed and that but I don't suggest at the current state of the game to get it. I will say get it on a sale or wait for patches that fix the problems.   Update Season 2: Soul Calibur 6 devs ruined the game by adding 50/50 which makes the game 2 touch, there is still no skill in the game. Anyone can literally win against a solid player because not everyone is perfect with defence. It is a shame that the game is getting tarnished like this, the copium is gone. o7  Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
166573886,english,0,1778820,"After putting a good amount of hours into the game and reaching High purple/Low blue ranks, I can honestly say that this is the least amount of fun I've ever had with a Tekken game. The amount of catering to new players and spamming playstyles makes the game feel like a coinflip. The introduction of armored powercrush moves, the heat system as a whole, and the return of rage arts makes the game feel like garbage. Movement/sidestepping doesn't feel as rewarding when the opponent can just mash 2+3 and catch you regardless of positioning. The roster is great....the only problem is that you don't see 80% of it in online matches because King/Dragonov/Victor/Reina exist.  For $80 I could have gifted all of my friends a coinflip simulator instead and had about the same amount of fun.  Every match feels the exact same. Apply pressure>Opponent activates heat>Negative frames>Opponent 50/50's>Block for neutral frames>Opponent Powercrushes>Hard knockdown>Wakeup>Block>Take 30% of healthbar from chip damage>Punish>Combo>Opponent Rage Art/Heat Burst>Round lost. Literally every game.   More floor/wall breaks, untechable grabs in certain situations, Dragonov, Losing health on certain inputs that are 100% necessary for relevant combo damage, Dragonov, GOD AWFUL TRACKING/MOVEMENT, No penalty/reward when an opponent ""plugs"", Dragonov, extremely poor matchmaking balance, poor character balance, fan service, the list goes on.  I had high hopes for Tekken 8, but honestly I'm just disappointed. Will likely stick to 2D fighters where things work as intended and make sense.  60% win rate and still deranking. GG Harada.

They doubled down on the features that the entire community disliked and told us that this was a patch that would give us more defensive options. By defensive options they meant here are more plus frame moves to force your opponent to block and guess and you need to out mash your opponent for optimal gameplay.  The developers at this point obviously think the community is a bunch of kids who dont know what they want and they absolutely know best so we should just all take it.  Screw that this game sucks ass, do not buy it for Season 2 till they make significant changes.  Original Review: Balance aside, the game launched and then an updated added an in game store revealing why we were missing cosmetics from Tekken 7. Then the battle pass came, and now whenever you login you get 20 notifications saying you got x item or check out the battle pass.  It feels very scummy and they didnt allow season pass owners to get a stage with Heihachi. They are just trying to suck the money out of the playerbase."

I've yet to see Murray, Harada or anyone in the Tekken dev/publisher teams comment anything further than a pathetic Excel sheet that was bypassed the same day by using new accounts with family sharing. - Pluggers still unpunished by using the most obvious workarounds. - Stupid ass FT2 ranked mode that only favors rushdown-yolo-random-heat for 90% of rounds. - They promoted Season 2 patch to be a ""defense oriented patch"", but I've yet to see the most glaring balance issues addressed.  The devs have no idea of what the game is about, yet they keep pushing this ""aggressive"" style, which is HR-speak for dumbing the game down so that the market for DBZ-Tenkaichi is less intimidated by the game and buys it like the drones they are. 0 faith left in Bamco. 0 faith left in Harada, Murray and their team of yes-men.

188007133,english,0,1778820,"While currently the overall reviews for this game are positive, most of the players that initially played and left their positive review are unfortunately gone.  The game is simply not fun to play at the state it's in. The character balancing is almost non existent in my opinion. The characters that were strong at the launch of the game are still strong a year later. They have pushed out balance changes during the year nerfing some of those characters, but it wasn't enough.  The 3D aspect of the 3D fighting game is more of a gimmick now than it ever has been. If you try to utilize the 3D aspect and sidestep, you can and most likely will at times get punished for trying seeing as a lot of moves track absurdly. The tracking should be heavily changed and nerfed, if you sidestep properly you should be rewarded, the opponent shouldn't just auto-realign to you during their strings. Some moves track right or left and you have to sidestep into the other direction. Some of those same moves track almost a full 180 (some track, but not that much), which leads to confusion as you will get hit when you're sidewalking and are almost behind the opponent.  With a lot of moves tracking where they shouldn't, if you add in absurd hitboxes you get the current condition of Tekken 8. Phantom hitboxes are a thing and I think that's fine as long as it's not too much. But if you add in the fact that when you sidewalked and are beside your opponent while he's doing his move. If you try to attack him before he's done you can and will get hit first yourself. By attacking you extend your hurtbox and for whatever reason there's a big chance you get hit first. That's just stupid.  Season 2 is around the corner, hopefully we will see some improvements.  EDIT: Season 2 is ass"
189798484,english,0,1778820,"This game Is hands down the worst Tekken ever made to date. First, the game is designed to be a button mashing fest where low level and high level gameplay look identical due to the extreme lack of depth in this game. Secondly, the monetization is so bad they re-release content from TEKKEN 7 and charge you for it in their battle pass. Thirdly, character move-sets have been homogenized to the point all characters essentially do the same thing. There are no longer interesting play styles and archetypes in this game. Finally, the story has to be one of the worst written, cringe inducing stories I have had the displeasure of playing. At first it was so bad it was good but now, with the inclusion of Heiachis story the story is an absolute joke. I am a huge Tekken fan and have never been particularly good at Tekken. I got to fujin as my highest rank in Tekken 7 and enjoyed every step of the way including the loses. There was always something to learn and something to improve at. There is always a point in all fighting games where they become 50/50 fiestas and if you enjoy that all power to you, but one thing is certain, this game is not Tekken anymore."

176382192,english,0,1778820,"Once legendary fighting game series has lost its way.  It's now tainted with shady monetization practices, questionable ""casino"" gameplay mechanics, nonsensical character balancing and each dlc character is guaranteed to be so overpowered at launch... It's near pay to win.   I've been a fan since Tekken 1 and it's bizarre to see where the series has gone. The once focus on real life fighting styles is also gone and replaced with lasers, guns and other projectiles.  The ultimate edition does not include all dlc (even in the first season). Truly something that would make Ubisoft executives proud.  I hope Tekken team starts to focus more on the core gameplay and less on the atrocious  cosmetics.  Update after Season 2  Movement is pretty impressive now. Tekken team hinted for months about this S2 patch that would balance the game and make defense more feasible....however they have doubled down and made the ""casino"" gameplay even more extreme. The most viable strategy now is to rush down your opponent before they rush you. A pretty sad state of affairs could have been avoided if the devs made gradual small changes; instead of one huge patch with very significant changes, withheld from the community until the very launch.  I was excited to pre order the $100 version of the game when it first was announced. Since then there have been: a battle pass and an in game shop added just post launch Paid cosmetics and a paid stage not included in the $100 version of the game and the game now is so far from what Tekken is that it should probably be named something else.  In its current state Tekken 8 is similar to that time you were finished playing the witcher 3 and started watching the netflix adaptation expecting more good content.  After playing since Tekken 1 and being around in the arcade glory days, I guess this is where I get off.  I truly do hope that Harada and crew can get their act together and get this series back to its glory days...I will pass on S2 dlc until then."
191782728,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 is my first Tekken and I main Reina. I love her and this game to pieces. I've always understood why people preferred the defensive playstyle of previous Tekkens, but I enjoyed the aggressive focus of this game. I felt the aggressor should be rewarded for taking risks, not punished. Defence was now something IMPRESSIVE instead of just being a backdash magic 4 fest. You were still REWARDED for good defence despite it being harder.  I understand this game wants to focus on aggression and appealing to new players and I don't see the point of doing Tekken 7 again. But this is terrible guys. Terrible. You've turned most characters' rushdown into the most braindead, button mash fest it's ever been. Defence isn't hard anymore, it's IMPOSSIBLE. Everyone has good Mid/Low mixes regardless of if they deserved it or not. Character identity is being shot down in the street by removing execution and weaknesses. It is NOT FUN to play a character with NO EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS and NO WEAKNESSES. I am a new player who picked up a MISHIMA. Why do you think new players are some TikTok braindead idiots? And why are you trying to appeal to them when Tekken is famously difficult so they're not going to waste their time on it anyway? And why do your changes not even encourage TikTok braindead idiots to play because they, like everyone, are incapable of guessing correctly more than 50% of the time??? Are you guys just homogenising the cast because it's easier to balance? Why do we pay you then?  Not only is the balance of this patch in SHAMBLES because you removed so many character weaknesses so now they're just perfect. This patch is BUGGED too! Paul has an unintentional unblockable. There are numerous camera glitches resulting in unintentional wall splats. Steve qcf1 STILL randomly whiffs. On and on and on, and guaranteed there will be more the longer the patch is up. Not to mention all the new animations look TERRIBLE. Speeding up animations like Feng's qcf1 makes it look unnatural. Or Reina's d2, 1+2 just copy and pasting her 1+2. Pigeon Roll from Dragunov looks silly. Feng's b4, 2 doesn't match his fighting style at all or even look like a real attack. So you're telling me you spent 4 months on this patch not only for it to be unbalanced, but it also lacks ANY SENSE of quality control? What have you guys been doing all this time to not even test for BUGS?  Worst of all, it has been 24 hours since the patch dropped, and you guys haven't reverted the changes, temporarily taken down the servers or even SPOKEN to us. Not even assured us that you're on it and things will be okay. I still have faith you can fix this, but I'm losing faith that you can balance this game or that you care enough about the pros livelihood or what people sacrifice to try get good at this game. You're gonna do this again. Just like you've added hatchet kicks to characters who don't deserve it multiple times. Given characters tracking Hellsweeps multiple times. Given tracking plus on block moves to characters multiple times.   I don't know what you guys need to change to get it together, but change it and GET IT TOGETHER."

Everyone has an easy 50% damage launch combo that takes longer than a turn based RPG. Cheating is Rampant and unmanaged... I could go on and on.  If you are a button masher, or a self hating tryhard that is willing to study an impossible amount of frame data to tilt a 50/50 in your favor, you might enjoy this game.

Tekken 8 heat system was rough in Season 1 - it messed with character expression and turned matches into Heat spamming.  But Season 2 is a complete mess. It’s not Tekken anymore, just a button-mashing simulator with no depth.  New players might enjoy it, but veterans are better off waiting for changes or skipping it entirely."
172467636,english,0,1778820,"This is a game that has simply hurt me too many times. I don't mind strong characters, I really don't. I could get my balls handed to me on a silver platter and still have fun, but that's just the thing. Sometimes, this stuff just ain't fun. Maybe it's just me but as a person who's been playing since Tekken 7, I'll just get to the point, I'm not going to say anything like, ""OH, old Tekken good new Tekken bad"", in fact i really enjoy the heat system and overall aggression. But it feels just, way too mashy? You get so minus to a point where sidestepping is literally not an option, and sidestepping itself is already really tricky to get the hang of yet very rewarding, sometimes however it simply feels impossible and you feel trapped and as a player it sucks. I play Paul, Jin, Kazuya, Leo, Dragonouv, and Devil jin, and I notice that I only do well once I start ""cheesing"" which might mean many things to many different people. So I'll be a bit more blunt and just say what my heart feels as of this moment, writing this review.   Neutral does not exist  At least that what it feels like to me, I don't see a point in doing a heat engager cancel in neutral when i'm gonna end up JUST AS MINUS if I had missed it anyways. Countless times I would think, ""Yes this is a safe distance, I will engage heat to utilize my resource advantage over the enemy. Only for them to just RA in response and magically magnetically gravitate towards me? Perhaps this is just a skill issue on my end but aside from that. Some times you feel extremely boxed in. Characters like King, Lidia, just sorta lock you in and once again, this might be a knowledge check, and I might just be bad but keep in mind I'm like the average purple rank. I have a Tekken King level friend that claims I am Kishin level, yet whenever I try to climb the ranks it just feels impossible? I swear I'd be on a 6 winstreak, lose once, and I'd be where I statred. Became a bit of an inside joke where we'd celeberate our ranks by going  ""Hey guys! I ranked from up from mighty ruler to mighty ruler!""  And I wish this was a joke but occasionally I would throw a demotion game, just so I can repromote and get that boost.   Ranking is messed up Footsies feel off There's no other game like tekken but sometimes it just hurts.  I'm open to any comments but I'm really just not in the mood for any git gud or tips. Too heartbroken for that.  I want to love Tekken but as I kept playing I realised that this is NOT healthy for me. I'd play Tekken with my friends and it'd always end in me going into a complain session. The worst part is that they'd just agree with me. All my complaints about random mid combo sideswaps, input eating, sidesteps turning into jumps and ducks, dropping combos because of wall jank. I wanted to be wrong, I wanted to be told ""Hey, ur just bad, here's a tip on how to overcome this"" But no. I'm sure some of you had those moments, maybe they're a lot more rarer than mine, how knows.   But yeah, I'm writing this, with pain and salt in my mind, having just uninstalled it after being deleted by my buddy playing Lidia and Reina.   Tekken is good game. but it's just not good for ME. So, I'm quitting for now.  Maybe I'll come back after a year or two, or when the heihachi DLC drops.  Maybe then it might feel better.   EDIT 25/9/2024 I recently reinstalled Tekken 8 after seeing heihachi, i got filled with hope and motivation. I joined some ranked matches and immediately get reminded of everything I had complained about in the above statement. Maybe it really is a skill issue, but once more.   Can't sidestep because I get locked in. People would rather mash their way out instead of going for parries and sidesteps or simply blocking and waiting for a gap. Which is fine! IF, it didn't work like 80% of the time.  Neutral? What's that? It's a contest of who can overwhelm the other guy first. Footsies only last for like 5 seconds before somebody, be it me, or the opponent, feels the compelling need to throw out some random heat move.  But compared to before, my head is clearer.   So I have suggestions, some of you might like it, some of you might not.  Ngl, KEEP OFFENCE THE SAME. I honestly think this is the most ""FUN"" Tekken in the same way that Guilty Gear STRIVE is the most ""FUN"" Guilty Gear to the masses.  My only problem is that as a player of both games, Guilty Gear has a more streamlined defence, block high, block low, occasionally try a parry and dust grab.  Tekken? You give me side steps, you give me Highs, Mids and Lows to worry about. You give me not just grabs, but different kinds of grabs from tackles, to feints, each with their own unique uses for repositioning, and unique ways to break them too. You give me power crushes, you give me while standings, all these moves, and I get to use NONE of them because I'm minus 100 and the Reina/Lydia/Lars/Victor/Jun is bullying me with their 50/50s and homing stance locks. Once again, maybe to the better players she's not an issue but wouldn't it be nice to actually be able to sidestep in what is basically the ONLY game worth playing that allows it?  TL:DR, Just buff defence. That's it, the options are there, just give the players more opportunities to use them and honestly the game will feel so much better.   Once again, I am the average purple rank player, I play this game for fun, climbing ranks? Sure it's nice to climb but at the end of the day what everybody wants is some GOOD A$$ TEKKEN. Maybe I'm just too defensive in an offense oriented game, but a majority of my playstyle's strength comes from defence. Maybe that's why I feel so limited?  EDIT 2 AS OF 26/10/2024  This time this is a salt review, THE GAME IS STILL TRASH NOTHING HAS CHANGED PEOPLE CAN JUST GET AWAY WITH SO MUCH FORCED 50/50s I DONT GET IT, I CAN'T SIDESTEP, I CAN'T PUNISH AFTER A SUCCESSFUL SIDESTEP (Though I skill issue on my part, I'm talking about the moves that just send the characters flying so far i.e. dragonouv smash) BACK TURN COMBOS ON THE ON THE WALL ARE STILL BEYOND JANK)   is this Tekken or is this 3d Strive man? Because if that's what your going for, Strive executes the aggression idea WAY BETTER.  You are NOT rewarded for having good defense in this game! (Typed this after losing to a sidestep stance spam jun and Victor with that lanky af CH launcher sweep)  Stuff needs to be more minus on whiff so people can't just throw stuff out willy nilly, that or make it so that sidesteps actually work, I swear, in one ranked session alone I have encountered FIVE SITUATIONS where I have sidestepped so hard, that I swapped sides with the opponent, ONLY TO GET HIT ANYWAYS?????  Good news tho, I reached Blue rank (it's the same issue there too...)  Also, I want characters that are hard to play because they require SKILL to use, not characters that are hard to play because they SUCK. Bamco wtf are you smoking with that DLC money bro.......  Edit fir 26/1/2024 Hey guys, I reached blue rank with 3 characters, Jin Paul, And Heihachi, and I'll be honest. Things haven't changed. My blue rank friend is now a Tekken Emperor and even he still agrees it's sort of the same up there in ramks, that is, mashfest. I've improved as a player and have come to realise that it's not neccessarily the characters in this game that are busted and moreso the game itself being busted. That is all.   Blah blah Defense should be buffed, blah blah 50/50 spamfest you know how it goes.  I do have one new complaint though, some characters just seem to have the weirdest autotracking stuff. You'd sidestep something flawlessly and still magically get hit by the second part of the move as they magically lock onto you.   As riduculous as it sounds, Armoured Core 6 (Another game I have been playing) Is a better and more fun fighting game than Tekken, and it's not even remotely close to a fighting game. Weird.  I'm not even writing this update with salt, I've gotten past the salt and reached the point where I'm just empty?  SEASON2... KMS"

On a real note, this patch is the most out of touch thing I have seen in any game that I have ever played. What a great ""Defensive"" patch. This new era of Tekken is so void of character archetypes it's actually crazy. Every character is now a brain dead 50/50 stance character with homing plus frames mids and crazy lows.   Every character utilises the system mechanics exactly the same way. We got heat engage into crouch so of course every character needs a crazy full crouch low to be able to take advantage of that, right?  I don't know if this is fixable and at this point I kinda hope Tekken as a series dies, because Bandai Namco does not deserve more money. Let's hope another 3D fighter gets released that can replace Tekken."

This recent S2 patch, however, has drastically undermined my chances and those of many players like myself. It’s essential to take the art of Tekken seriously for self-improvement, and I’m beginning to question if this game’s current state supports that goal.  I’m not pleased with how this change has affected my character and the game overall. It feels as if I’m being pushed into a play style that doesn’t align with my approach. This patch has been incredibly frustrating and needs urgent attention. Despite all my hard work—practicing, studying my opponents, and analyzing gameplay—it all seems to lose meaning when I’m forced to eat unearned 50/50's and adopt a style more suited to a BlazeBlue character. Losing the essence of my character is something I cannot accept. At this point, I barely recognize who I’m playing and what I'm playing anymore...

This game is a gimmick in itself and I'm embarrassed to have put so much time into it. The better you get at this game, the more you will dislike it. I promise you. I will not go another year expecting this game to feel fair or balanced.

Either make it that the graphics revert back after the match or just OPTIMIZE THE GAME."
191713020,english,0,1778820,I dunno man. This game increasingly favors the aggressive style of play and rewards the player for it. more 50/50 gets added to the game and defense feels worse every match.  I dunno why it is such a good feeling for players to framelock someone until their HP bar hits zero. Especially problematic in heat where you just block and pray to not die.   The best defense is offense here which destroys the punishment aspect of the game. I don't even feel like my opponent is reacting to my stuff.

Everything about the exchanges revolve around 3 key factors; heat, rage, and insanity. Your opponent may have heat or rage and not be choosing a sane option at the time, which ends up being the insanity triad or as I call it the rock paper scissors version of dynamite.  Rock; you've decided to block, sure hope you can deal with the + frame followup chance.  Paper; you've decided to press attack to interrupt a potential assault, sure hope your opponent doesn't choose an option to interrupt you or intercept you in the one of 500 ways each character can.  Scissors; you've decided to push a + frame advantage and can continue pressuring using heat or more + frame on block attacks, sure hope your opponent can block.  Oh they decided to use their heat? Sure would be a shame if you randomly chose s- oh you got interrupted.  Oh they decided to rage art? Sure would be a shame if you just stood there like a dunce because the startup is a solid half a second. Oh they decided to press ANYTHING ELSE? Good thing you were pressing something that wouldn't get eaten by heat's + frames or beaten by rage art, that somehow leads to you getting heat activation to 80% of your opponents life.  HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...

169977339,english,0,1778820,"This ""new generation"" of fighters is disgusting. And this game further proves it.  I'm higher ranked in this game than I am in Tekken 7. Yet I'm embarrassed to be as high as I am because of how cheesy it has become with no updates to fix it.  1. Rage still exists in this game to pander to the ""casual audience"". People who are selfish and greedy. They are the reason E-Sports should not exist.  2. The guard damage in this game makes up for sooo much more than it needs to. Almost half your health will be gone at times due to chip damage with only 2 ways to earn it back. Getting any hit in you can, which is barely that good to be quite frank or to land into heat with any move that transitions into it, which is the MUCH, MUCH better option. It restores a LOT of it. Whenever someone DOES take chip damage in this game, it's most likely within a single instance that all of it happens. Not even building up to it, but you're screwed into just losing it. The mechanic also allows you to have RAGE at half health which was a HUGE oversight.  3. All the fundamentals of Tekken are thrown out at times. And it works! There are people who don't even rely on learning the most basic aspects of Tekken through using heat and rage alone as a combination. And before people say ""get gud"", these people will reach Tekken King rank at LEAST! Which is more than 90% of what the community is at. You have to watch out for low parries, heat, rage, armor crush.  4. Speaking of armor crush, there are TOO many in this game that whiff one of it's two weaknesses. Imagine putting a mechanic in a game where you give it two weaknesses, and then for 0 reasons that should make sense, 1 of those weaknesses don't work. You'll hit low, one of the TWO ways to beat the mechanic (besides blocking SOME and punishing.) and you just see your character's leg travel through the opponent.  5. The game has become a guessing game and almost nothing more. Exclusively, it has constantly become guessing. And if you guess wrong once, the match may as well be over. Instead of using proper spacing, skill, etc... It has become ""Is THIS going to happen? Cross my fingers!"" as to how to counter it. Because if you don't, it won't matter if you block or not. It can be the end of the match BECAUSE you blocked and had little way to restore your health.  6. Oki/mixups have become weaker overall. This is more a personal gripe to be honest. So I can't really give it much fault.  7. The game suffers the same exact issue TEKKEN 7 had. Every character can just do extreme damage off of a single combo. Sometimes off of a single move. In all honesty, single hits should do good damage that stack up well and combos should do good damage too overall (Though character dependent as it may be), but the damage is ridiculous. If you get multiple hits outside of a combo, it should trump doing a combo imho. But just like the previous game, the damage is just overdone when it comes to combos and everyone's strategy is the same.  8. Instead of actually trying to fix these issues, the company has been focused on their dumb Tekken store. Every patch has been ""eh"" at best. It helped balance the game, but it still feels like the same crap overall. The game pretty much has the same issues and mentalities since it's release.  9. Heat is wasted potential. Instead of thinking how to use it, it's something blown off in a single instance for the most part and puts too many intimidation tactics while also doing some extremely corny crap. (Guard damage being the big thing. You take guard damage, it isn't gonna build up to it gradually. It's gonna happen right there and then). Instead of finding a way to manage ""Heat"", it's just an explosive burst of damage that everyone gets some benefit off of to make up for their weaknesses and is 40% of the game at least. The mechanic needs to be reworked, because it's not a bad concept. Just a badly delivered concept.  10. Moves will lock you down worse than ever before. TEKKEN 7 already had this issue and they somehow made it even WORSE. You will be stuck in a state of pressure with almost no way to pressure some instances, because of how long the stun you're in is or because the opponent is most likely out of reach.  11. This one is something that needs to be fixed. When slowdown happens near the end of a match, it causes characters to be pushed back. Thus causing their moves to reach slower to the opponent. Basically, this is some kind of weird glitch for ""aesthetic purposes"" where one person can lose because their move came out in a way it shouldn't have.  My major complaint though is, this game isn't fun. It's usually a one sided mess from both players. I can't recall many matches where it was a back and forth. Mainly someone locking a person down for a while and the other person MAYBE getting lucky enough to do the same."

But they don't realize that casuals will play ANYTHING and have fun. When you design a game for casuals the rest of the game suffers and mechanics that built game depth get flushed out for ""cool"" flashy things that are broken. This game also has so much fluff for a fighting game, you have to learn 100+ strings and moves and heat on top of that makes the game mind numbing to learn. In a match the game focuses on who can apply their 50/50 first and who can make the other person guess. That's why the game play has no depth after you learn the beginner stuff. Every DLC they release is just designed to be broken so everyone can cough up 6 bucks.  It takes them more then a year to maybe nerf a character. And the top 10 characters are the same even after a year. I believe HEAT has a place in tekken but HEAT with CHIP and Recoverable Health is the STUPIDEST thing ever. Tekken was a fighting game that was different because it rewarded defense. Every other fighting game is just a MASH fest and the more I play other fighting games I realize why tekken went in this direction. Every other fighting game is doing it so ofc they would think they need to go in this direction. They also wanted to make the game spectator friendly but watching Tekken 8 is the same game every time where the other guy applies a 50/50 first. Boring and not worth the time."

191873582,english,0,1778820,"Devs betrayed trust by promising to improve defensive options but instead doubled down on aggression while also continuing the homogenization of characters into stance rushdown characters with different skins.   There's no incentive to outplay your character's weaknesses anymore since with season 2 they made every character without any fault. Character identity lost and the game boils down to who can throw their kitchen sink first and get their 50/50 in after doing a combo with up to 100+ dmg and obscene wall travel. It used to be that only a few characters  have this good wall travel but with season 2 every character can do this while also doing crazy damage. It's not fun at all and it doesn't feel good for neither the attacker nor the defender. It begs the question if they even play their own game. They have at this point of time released news of an emergency patch to address the issues with the game but after a patch of this magnitude where all characters were affected, it would take much more than one emergency patch to fix this. The game right now is pure guessing and hoping and that's not the Tekken we love. + on block homing mids to discourage stepping attacks making this game feel more like a 2D fighter than a 3D one.

192645848,english,0,1778820,"This is not a review of the game, I'm going to mention the nonsense with the season 2 patch and other frustrations about the game in general which are just my opinions. If you want to know about the game, my thoughts are as follows: The story is fun and over the top, I genuinely enjoyed it. The heat system is cool and flashy but over time gets frustrating to deal with and I will explain my thoughts on it further down. Base character roster is decent in size. Graphics are good. Now my issues with the season 2 patch. The devs said they were focusing on defence this season, what a joke. the defensive options they gave us was allowing you to buffer in a sidestep just before a round starts and making side stepping ""easier"" in certain situations. That's about it as far I saw from playing and hear people mentioning. Now the big question is why are they not utilising the heat system for defensive options as well? Street fighter and mortal kombat and probably other fighters that have a resource meter can utilise it for defensive options but in Tekken 8 that's just not a thing? The heat system is ONLY used for offense. That's just lazy because all the big fighting games do learn from each other and borrow ideas and implement them in their own way into their respective games so how did the devs miss including such an important part of their new heat system? It makes no sense.  They put a battle pass in the game (which used quite a bit of re-used assets from tekken 7 and eye color changes?? why cant there be a slider for that?) because street fighter 6 has one too? i understand that its all cosmetic and you dont need any of that stuff but people have asked for years for more cosmetic options like tekken 6 and tag 2 had, to buy with in game currency and now they just selling that for real money on top off paying for dlc characters and their stages SEPERATELY??This game is getting too greedy. Whenever a new dlc character comes out they tend be a bit overpowered in certain aspects and over a few patches get balanced out, its becoming a noticeable trend in tekken 8 and I'm very against that. So if you want to experience the story mode, wait for a dirt cheap special, if you want to play the game online and really dig into that aspect of the game, I would recommend you look at another fighting game instead of this game.  Edit: They are applying band aid level fixes as a start to the season 2 changes and have plans for more changes (hopefully substantial ones) as the current season continues. Depending if they actually manage to get the game into a better state I may update this ""review"" however the negatives I have about the game other than the season 2 nonsense (season pass prices, separate characters & stages and battle pass in a full price game) those don't seem likely to be changed."
191829102,english,0,1778820,"It's ironic; the first time I thought to review this game, I wanted to leave it a positive score -- a score that would have been a no brainer for me. The roster is replete with vibrant personalities, and the gameplay, although by no means perfect, had a (somewhat) coherent vision and philosophy; aggression (in the form of pressure with and without heat moves), evasion (in the form of crushing and stepping), and player expression: these 3 qualities stuck out to me as the core elements that underpinned Tekken 8's identity. To be sure, some of these aspects were disagreeable to members of the Tekken community, especially its aggression, which some (many?) players derided as overly tuned. I wasn't fully onboard with the criticism. I agreed that certain characters (what's up Yoshi?) were a bit too powerful compared to the rest of the cast, and that some heat smashes (including that of my main, Asuka) were too difficult to sidestep, but I thought these were issues that easily could have been remedied by a simple patch. It was my honest opinion that even with its flaws, Tekken 8 sat atop the throne of 3D fighters.   With Season 2, the throne has been abdicated.   'Abdicated' implies some sort of intentional self-sabotage which was entirely planned on the part of Bandai Namco. It is a weird claim to make, but at present it's the only way I can make sense of the almost kamikaze-like direction taken by the director(s). Characters are now shadows of their former selves; every character can abuse their plus frames and chuck attack after attack after heat move after attack after heat smash after attack, to the point where the cast has become largely homogenised. Speaking as an Asuka main, she's completely lost her identity as a defensive character. She's just much better at playing aggressive than she is playing defensive. Her identity is a far cry from her original vision. It's no surprise that Fergus, a top Asuka main, titled his latest video about the character 'I Don't Recognize Her Anymore'. I've also heard about more than a few Zafina mains who felt as though the latest season made her too offensively oriented. Some of the balance changes are extremely questionable as well. The top tiers simply did not need buffs. Certain characters, such as Lee, also received what seem to be disproportionate nerfs, but don't you worry Lee mains: Bamco compensated by giving him buffs that make him more suited to the rushdown style they seem to have in mind for virtually every single character in the roster. It's disappointing, but above all it's confusing. The minds behind Tekken 8's balance patches seem to enjoy a significant social media presence and they doubtlessly know how the community feels about certain decisions. After all, it was vocal community push-back that prompted them to roll back the bizarre decision to impose chip damage for successfully broken throws. They most certainly knew the lay of the land, and so my question is simply this: Why would they make changes that they knew the community would dislike? Before the patch, we were promised buffs to the game's defensive options. This announcement was met with a great deal of fanfare, as several community members thought that an antidote to what they believed was an overwhelmingly aggressive game was on the way; they felt heard. So you can imagine the reaction of the community when Season 2 served to amplify the game's aggression to an overwhelming amount instead of toning it down. I don't know. I want to enjoy Tekken 8, I really do. If the devs truly did not know how the community would react to the new season, then they know now. It's incumbent on them to give the players what they want. No more pandering to a nebulously defined, perhaps even nonexistent contingent of 'casual' players that would get mowed down by the new system anyway. Please listen to the players who are actually offering criticism. It may serve you guys well."

A couple weeks after launch, they introduced Battle Passes(which was never revealed before hand, tricking customers like me and reviews to praise the game for no MTX). Now with the character I've been waiting for the longest, Heihachi, they released a DLC stage that wasn't apart of the deluxe edition, not even 1 year after launch and they are pulling this junk.

It's extremely frustrating because everything about this game is absolutely amazing and polished other than the actual gameplay. With proper handling this game could be one of the greatest fighting games of all time but since they are stubbornly clinging to their vision of a heavily offensive game with little to no counterplay, other than guessing your opponents next move correctly, we will likely get a giant flop of repetitive nonsense with little skill expression. The community has been extremely vocal about heading away from the insane aggression and forced 50/50 situations but the devs seem to think they know better. Unfortunately there is nothing else like Tekken out there and that's what makes this move away from core Tekken to a more  guess heavy coin flip simulator even more disappointing."

As of right now, you could just go into practice mode, pick almost any character and learn how heat and forced 50/50-s work and be a threat, this is not fun and totally nullifies factors that separates good players from bad ones.  Season 2 got released and we hoped that from an year of experience with season 1 they would finally deliver good balance patch, but they focused on more flashy moves that makes even less sense then what we had in season 1.

191694778,english,0,1778820,"First time i post a review ever because i am baffled, i never seen devs so out of touch with the community...  New season dropped and they made every character into a braindead easy mix up machine without a single buff to defense, from the start of tekken 8 players where vocal about the prominess of easy mix ups and the glaring nerfs to defense compared to past tekken games and yet they do a huge patch with lots of new moves that enphasis on every aspect the players disliked about the game.  No one litterally no one asked for these changes, even new players never asked for more offense in a game that clearly lacks defensive options and is easy to mash button and win like in most Tekken games.  Tekken especially with competetive Tekken 7 scene garnered a reputation of a game that has solid focus on fundamental skill such as movement, neutral and defense and seeing how Tekken 8 nerfed all this aspects is sad, even the tournament views are worse for T8 compared to T7 for how homoginized the characters are and streamlined the gameplay is with new systems.  But i still had hope since things could change for the better. however devs turning a deaf ear on their community that was extremly vocal about all te negative aspects of the game which made the experience worse just to double down on what everyone hates for some fabricated notion that ""it's good for new players"" is incomprehensible when people loved Tekken 7 which was massively succesful for a fighting game."
191720018,english,0,1778820,"I do not recommend Tekken 8 season 2 for these reasons.  -The developers do not understand the characters they design. They see that the character has strengths and weaknesses and continue to not let them have this weakness. Instead, they homogenize the character to be like the others making them overtuned. This was a big issue in Season 1 that made 70% of the roster oppressive. And the game is suppose to favor the aggressor, but it favored the aggressor too much to the point where it will look like a one player game sometimes. There is very little counterplay to these characters. =Season 2 did not address these things, they only made minor defensive changes like being able to side step from crouch and side step buffer. But that is not enough as they decided to buff almost everyone while giving them major/minor nerfs. However, this isn't the only thing that makes it bad. They also killed character identities like Law's WS4 CH DSS not being a thing anymore, Zafina stances, Feng Wei snake dash block, etc. They gave characters like Dragunov some more identity which is cool, but no character should have their identity being killed or overtuned. All they did was buff the weaknesses of each character instead of just letting them have this weakness and just buff their strength instead. But the developers do not understand their character designs. -The developers also did not address any of the dumb tracking some of the moves have like the heat bursts. Yes, some of the Heat bursts like Bryans still track even though they aren't suppose to.  Also removing CH Ki charge is the worse change I've ever seen. No one complained about it and people liked it."

All of this is being included in a game that's plagued with many other issues that need urgent fixing, like wonky netcode, terrible balance and no real penalties for cheaters/rage quitters.

191130721,english,0,1778820,"""For Season 2, we'd like to focus on defense in terms of the lateral aspects of a 3d fighting game.""   Followed by the developers spending over two hours without mentioning any defensive changes and only focusing on more BS 50/50 casino gameplay is hilarious.   Oh right, some genius decided that you should be punished for breaking a throw correctly and take chip damage.   Would not recommend anyone purchasing this game until they actually improve defense/movement to counteract the constant aggression.   [b]EDIT:[/b] Just wanted to add some extra feedback in case the developers become truthful when it comes to taking feedback.  1. Remove Chip Damage completely: Its a garbage mechanic and makes being on the receiving end of heat even more frustrating because even if you block the mix-ups correctly you're still punished enough to where you'll often lose 40% of your life bar from just chip damage and be put in range to where the next mix up will kill you.  2. Buff Movement: Backdash needs to be buffed to bait and create whiffs otherwise Tekken turns into everyone just constant throwing out hitboxes without thinking knowing that at worst they will hit on block and often times be plus still. Sidesteps need tuning to be more reliable since they can fail even if using them in the same situation as one in which they've succeeded previously.  3. Fix Phantom hitboxes/Nerf range of moves/Nerf homing moves/Remove string realignment GLOBALLY: All of these changes will also help with the problem above. People would play a lot slower in neutral which builds tension, makes a defensive more viable and allows there to be more neutral interactions instead of each player trying to bulldoze their way into constantly being in close range forcing a guessing game.  4.Severely nerf heat: I would love to just remove it completely but its already built into the core Tekken system. Instead just make it so that heat is something you have to earn in a game and make it so that once you activate it the meter never stops going down. Remove the ability to regenerate heat from moves/stances. Nerf Heat smashes across the board so that they don't cause stage interactions or wall splat. Heat smashes being so overbearingly strong streamlines a lot of the game play especially against characters like Jin/Heihachi. I would make every heat smash +3 or less on block since even when you block such powerful moves correctly you have to guess again for your life with another unfair mix-up.  5.Lower the plus frames on moves across the board, +5 is crazy for heat dash considering its not even something you have to earn to be able to do when you have heat active. There are also too many high reward moves that are also +6 on block or higher... Why?  6. Remove Unbreakable grabs and guard breaks from the game. They are just way too powerful and mentally taxing to deal with. Guard breaks also often lead to wall splats or wall blasts which makes them low risk for too high of a reward."
191738401,english,0,1778820,"To preface this - it's currently the launch of season 2 of Tekken 8. I like Tekken, I've played Tekken since Tekken 2. I've played every Tekken game to date. I like this franchise so much that I've spent energy following it and playing it over the course of my life.  This game is quite possibly the worst Tekken game I have ever played. I would consider Death by Degrees to be more true to form to Tekken's formula and aesthetic than this game.   You can see right now I have hundreds of hours in this game, you might be asking why? If you don't like it - why spend so much time. Here's why - I have desperately tried to cling onto the idea that if I played enough/ranked up enough it would suddenly click. I've also always liked Tekken and didn't want to drop a franchise I've historically enjoyed so I thought I was missing something.  I wasn't and that point has been proven now.  Tekken 8 was given out to players initially as a review copy without a battle pass addition. Once official release came around a battle pass was added to bypass the review phase. This battle pass and each one afterwards till now contains items which were normally obtained in Tekken games through in-game currency obtained from Online Matches or Arcade mode or even other party modes added in previous games such as Tekken Bowling or Tekken Volleyball.  However with Tekken 8 this was a unwelcome surprise and now it requires real world money.  This is why Tekken 8 now has a asterisk with the message ""This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity"".  This is not one of those times.  With the launch of season 2 they emphasised that the updates would favour defence options a bit more. Currently plus frames are rampant with many moves or heat activations which leave no room at all for you to retaliate and certain characters are utterly broken. I don't mean overpowered either but they have them too.  Paul can currently do f,1+2 into while standing 3 and it will bypass the guarding system and hit every time. To go even further, he can press 2 after that unblockable ws,3 and if you're at the wall, you just got wall splat. Which will possibly lead to you losing the match because you anticipated the move coming and blocked like a normal sane individual (You shouldn't have done that).  There is a plethora of similar issues with the game right now. There are many reasons the game is in the state that it is in but it comes to who's currently in charge. This narrows down to Kouhei Ikeda now being game director and Harada becoming an adviser. All ""heat"" on this issue is directed towards Harada who is sun setting his time with Tekken. All positive notes to take from T8 will be accredited to Ikeda's work on the game. All drawbacks will be learned from for the next game hopefully but ultimately it's Ikeda's series now. Many Soul Calibur developers have transitioned to Tekkens development.  That is the state of Tekken 8's development right now.  There is a bunch of issues why the game is not good right now: Too many plus frames. No actual defensive options. Terrible Heat mechanic. Many moves hitting off axis. Combo damage is incredibly high. Too many stance transitions (Everyone is Lei now apparently). Stock/State Power ups. Chip Damage.  The aesthetic of the previous games' are also lost entirely. T4 still holds the bar for the best with so little to show for it. They only needed a hint of flashy stuff or ridiculous concepts in Tekken. If you look at Clive you can see that's been thrown out the window.  What's also really disappointing is that a lot of players have tried putting the thought into peoples head that previous Tekken games were worse and they don't have the stomach to actually say the series got worse.  It's a really funny twist of fate that Tekken Tag Tournament 2 didn't kill Tekken but Tekken 8 - their most lavish and expensive title to date is doing a better job than Tag 2 ever did."

Но несмотря на все это banco выпустит коллаборацию с nike и сделает лимитированные часы вместо хороших патчей, поздравляю, это худший файтинг в истории. Единственное, что в нем хорошо - это графика.

This patch is a complete disaster that destroys the very essence of the game.  A chaotic gameplay experience The developers have completely shattered the game’s balance by making offense far too powerful. The game has turned into a mindless rushdown fest where defense, once a core pillar of the series, has become unnecessarily difficult. Reacting now requires an absurd mix of inhuman reflexes, encyclopedic knowledge, and lightning-fast analysis. Even worse, the game has become a never-ending lottery, a simple rock-paper-scissors match where luck outweighs technical skill. Every interaction feels like a gamble, making the experience frustrating and unbearable.  A disastrous development direction The decision to bring in SoulCalibur developers was a fatal mistake. Tekken is not SoulCalibur, and trying to force mechanics from a completely different game into Tekken’s system betrays the very DNA of the franchise. Harada and his team seem to have lost sight of what made Tekken a true fighting game masterpiece.  An outrageous price tag As if things weren’t bad enough, Bandai Namco is charging €40 for this mess! This price is absolutely ridiculous for a patch that turns Tekken into a game of pure luck. At this rate, I’d rather spend my money at the slot machines at the carnival—at least there, I know I’m gambling from the start.  An ultimatum for Tekken If this patch isn’t fixed soon, I’m done with Tekken.

DLC characters were fine because I was only going to play one or two characters so I didn't really mind not owning each character. But there is a big problem, you can't use the DLC characters in training, and you are unable to view the replays of a match against a DLC character (if you don't own the character). You legitimately have to PAY to learn the matchups against these characters, which is honestly disgusting. I don't really care about the tekken coins stuff because all you can do is buy cosmetics with them, so that doesn't really bother me, but it is really scummy to add ""V-Bucks"" to a $90 CDN game a few months after launch. The game is flawed with a really fun gameplay loop but ruined by terrible monetization choices."

The character stories was fine, it just beat 5 opponents to get a cinematic cutscenes. Some of few characters do have a funny cinematic cutscenes. The gameplay is great. I do like the combat system in this game. The combat animations were fast and smooth, making every fight feel incredibly dynamic.

I am a Tekken veteran and I can assure you: This game is close to Guilty Gear Strive than Tekken 7/6 etc.  With the new S2 patch now every character got buffed, from an already to bloated and crazy standard. Basically everyone upgraded from a machine gun to a tactical nuke. The game is and will be so pressure and 50/50 focused, that you won't have fun as a defender.  Legacy stuff, like ki-charge and manual teching (backroll tech) have been removed, completely altering the gameplay and simplefying it.  As a through-and-through Tekken fan:  THIS GAME WILL MAKE ME DROP IT IN THE NEXT 7 DAYS! I urge every Tekken fan to give a negative review and minimize gameplay in order to give them a heavy hit, otherwise things won't change.  I hope I can prevent any old Tekken Fan from buying this game. It isn't worth it; at most as a casual and even then you won't have fun being stomped by your opponents.  Do better Team Tekken!"

173335493,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8, while undeniably more accessible than its predecessors, has stripped away much of the tactical depth that defined the series. The game feels like it's been simplified to cater to a larger player base, but at the cost of what made Tekken unique. What we're left with is a game that's largely about 50/50 situations, with little room for the nuanced, defensive play that even 2D fighting games manage to preserve.  One of the biggest disappointments for me is how defense is not only unrewarded but outright punished, particularly with the introduction of chip damage. In other fighting games, there are defensive tools to counterbalance aggressive play, but in Tekken 8, it feels like the game is designed to reward the player who can memorize the best combos and apply pressure non-stop. The Ranked matches exacerbate this issue, becoming a toxic experience where opponents either quit after one match, have unbearable lag, or exhibit other frustrating behaviors.  After over 100 hours of trying to give this game a chance, I've lost the drive to continue. I might revisit it if Kunimitsu is reintroduced, but for now, Tekken 8 is getting uninstalled. I'm finding more satisfaction in games like Guilty Gear Strive or Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, where my efforts in practicing hit confirms are actually rewarded, unlike in Tekken 8, where any attempt at analysis seems to get me punished anyway.  The final straw for me is the Battle Pass system, which feels even more intrusive and unpleasant in Tekken 8 than in Rising. It's a feature I genuinely dislike and it only adds to my overall disappointment with the game."
157756742,english,1,1778820,"[b]Tekken 8, the latest installment in the iconic fighting game franchise developed by Bandai Namco, continues to redefine the genre with its polished gameplay, stunning visuals, and diverse roster of characters. I am going to go into detail about this:[/b] [list] [*][b]Stunning Visuals and Immersive Environments:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 screams breathtaking graphics and brilliantly designed environments that put players in dynamic and vibrant battle arenas. From bustling city streets to serene natural landscapes and from there to Nightmare realities, each stage is a visual spectacle, enhancing the overall gaming experience.[/i]  [*][b]Refined Gameplay Mechanics:[/b] [i]Building upon its previous installments, Tekken 8 introduces refined gameplay mechanics that offer a perfect balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for Tekken Pros. The controls are responsive and creative, allowing players to execute complex combos and special moves with precision. I can also add executing combos that are just frames, are much more easily executable now.[/i]  [*][b]Diverse Roster of Characters:[/b] [i]With a diverse roster of characters, each with their own unique fighting style and backstory, Tekken 8 offers something for every player. From classic favorites like Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama to newcomers with innovative fighting techniques like Azucena and Victor, the character selection is vast and varied, and rumored to be becoming bigger and bigger in the coming years.[/i]  [*][b]Engaging Story Mode:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 features an engaging story mode that delves deeper into the rich lore of the Tekken universe. Players embark on a thrilling journey filled with intrigue, betrayal, and epic showdowns, unraveling the mysteries behind each character's motives, with the main story just based on the Mishima Bloodline.[/i]  [*][b]Robust Online Multiplayer:[/b] [i]The online multiplayer feature of Tekken 8 delivers an exhilarating experience, allowing players to test their skills against opponents from around the world. With robust matchmaking features and various online modes, including ranked matches and tournaments, the competitive scene is vibrant and engaging, the net-code is not perfect but its way better than the Tekken 7 when it came out back in the days. [/i]   [*][b]Customization Options:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 offers extensive customization options, allowing players to personalize their favorite characters with unique costumes, accessories, and cosmetic items. Also paying homage to other characters from the games like Resident Evil with adding their customized costumes in the game. From traditional martial arts attire to outlandish outfits, the customization options are virtually limitless, adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, so that my character may look cool while Kicking A$$.[/i] [/list]  [b][i]In the end I would like to add that Tekken 8 surpasses expectations as a fighting game masterpiece, combining stunning visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, with new Game Modes and a diverse cast of characters to deliver an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or new to the franchise, Tekken 8 offers something for everyone and cements its place as one of the finest fighting games of all time. I would recommend highly to anyone and to anybody who is into fighting games or not, as this will hook them up.[/i][/b]"

169651406,english,0,1778820,"There will be always be 50/50s in fighting games, but the keyword here is 'forced'—forced by the universal mechanic, not by the unique characters or player agency over them. When you factor in those heat interactions over all the sets, it becomes a core mechanic that decides the outcome of the match. It's as if it 'fills the entire game,' like an anchor point, and the characters' unique styles and stances take a back seat. The matches are way too fast and aggresive for any deliberate play.  Bottom line is, I hate the heat mechanic itself and want it gone. Heat engagers break momentum (like those long goddamn rage arts were not enough), push the other player to the wall, and force you to guess. Yes, it gives you a chance to redeem a mistake, but it's like the game is forcing me to play a certain way that I never asked for. I also have to use my heat, be aggressive, and win that one interaction or avoid losing to it, or the other player will force me to the wall. This was not the case in T7, as you could only do that with good reads and combo execution, not absurd pushbacks. T7 was also very good in terms of balance in season 5. Yes devs are 'fixing' the game but the game itself is the problem. They just want the fights to look good on streams and tournaments; hence heat, but they killed defense now there's no  turtle syle , baiting etc you just cant do it and there's no incentives its just mash mash heat engager  heat smash  forward momentum mash mash. I play when I can but I don't enjoy it as much as tekken 7, strangely it doesnt even feel good to win as its more mentally draining than fun imo. Maybe that just me idk."

176364038,english,0,1778820,"Probably the easiest and most aggressive entry in the series, Tekken 8 has solid features but is marred by scummy monetization policies. It feels like I'm playing a free-to-play, gacha game anytime there is a new update. Miss the latest DLC character? The main menu will remind you constantly of their presence, with the in-game store taking priority over the ""real"" menu, forcing you to navigate around it. This is unfortunate in a cheaper game, but understandable. It's unforgivable when the base cost is 70 USD, and another 40 for a ""character pass"" that includes 4 characters and nothing else.   More concerning is the way Bandai Namco handled this. The Tekken Team has always said one thing and done another regarding these policies. Murray and Harada were on record saying there would be no in-game store, battle pass, or loot boxes. But without fail, all of these things have come to pass. The only caveat is potentially the loot boxes -- the asset is currently being used to advertise bundled costume packages -- but give it time. Recently, Heihachi's stage was sold separately from his DLC -- a departure from Tekken 7's season pass, and the community has been up-in-arms over this. But I feel the Heihachi stage drama is  just a figurehead for a larger discontent that the community feels over constantly being asked to pay more and more for things that used to be free.   The game needs a change in direction ala No Man's Sky at this point to right the ship. There's too much negativity surrounding it, and Bandai Namco need to re-establish good will with their players. That's the only apology worth anything."
191694070,english,0,1778820,"Ill start off by saying i love Tekken and i don't want to see it fail. That being said if you are someone who, like me wanted to pick up Tekken because you saw the intricate movement, whiff punishment and defensive prowess of JDCR and you wanted to work towards that level then i have bad news for you. That is not this game. Tekken 8 went in a different direction, once you get past all the knowledge checks what you are left with in this game is an overabundance of canned mixups, oppressive frames and in general very few options to move around in 3 dimensions or play defensively. This isn't coming from a jaded legacy player either, my first Tekken was Tekken 7 and i have to say Tekken 8 has mostly moved away from what made me fall in love with it in the first place.  TLDR: I don't think this game is worth taking seriously as a competitive game. If you just wanna play it for shits casually it will probably be fun."
185237105,english,0,1778820,"Gameplay wise, it's nothing compared to previous Tekken games, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's designed to be more accessible, which is good, but the price for casual interest is very high. It's just a completely different game—one that rewards mindless offense and punishes defensive play styles, forcing players to just run at each other all the time.  If you're to play this game, understand that you'll get tons of games where you'll lose 70+% of your HP not because you played poorly, but simply because you guessed incorrectly. If someone with 5 hours can luck into a win against a higher-ranked player simply because that player guessed incorrectly, then we have a problem. Also understand that this version of Tekken is no longer a martial arts fighting game—expect to see and fight against guns, laser beams, dragons, Ifrit, and a lot more anime-looking stuff. If you just want down-to-earth martial arts, then maybe just wait for the new VF game 🤷🏽.  And oh, I'm not even gonna talk about the whole DLC mess (releasing the shop months after release to avoid bad reviews, putting legacy characters (and a stage) behind a paywall, etc. There's already a lot of reviews about that, here and on other platforms."
191850184,english,0,1778820,"As a player with over 3500 hours in Tekken 7 I was very excited to see what the next entry in the series would be. My review is being written as of Day 3 of Season 2.  [h2] Network and PC performance [/h2] When the game released on PC it still had performance and network issues that were reported in the network test. As a user with a custom build machine that is tuned well and can play all the latest games on highest settings Tekken 8 still has performance issues at times. Every time I am on the character select screen the game will become slightly choppy when swapping and selecting characters. The game can sometimes crash on PC. Users that played Tekken 7 on PC will remember if you would alt tab there was a chance the game would crash. This is still on ongoing issue with Tekken 8.  Regarding net code issues, it still feels like Tekken 7 season 4. I am not a developer so I do not know what can be done to improve the net code but it is sad to see a fighting game release in the year that it did (2024) and have such poor net code when other titles like street fighter 6 and guilty gear strive have phenomenal roll back net code.   [h2] Presentation + content [/h2] The costume redesigns the characters received are a warm welcome and do a lot for the returning cast. The music and stages in the game are brilliant. Tekken 8 honestly has one of my favourite soundtracks in the series. I was really looking forward to the story mode as I was invested in seeing what happened after the ending of Tekken 7. The story mode was brilliant and is easily my favourite one iv played in a fighting game. Hopefully we can see a big follow up during a DLC release for Tekken 8.  Customisation is cool and I hope it continues to see free updates over time. The jukebox features is something I always wanted for PC users so it's nice to see us finally get it after missing out on it being a PS4 exclusive for Tekken 7.  I do wish there was more game modes available to play. For example having Team battle come back from the older entries would be really fun for offline play with friends or online in private lobbies.  [h2] Gameplay [/h2] This entry is very rewarding for aggressive play. The new heat system promotes players to stay on the offensive rather than  using movement and blocking to counter play their opponent.  With the new chip system you are punished for blocking and trying to play slowly to get into a better position. This is a huge change in the direction from the previous entry (Tekken 7) where you could use that games movement system to block and take your time to get out of situations. Since Tekken Tag tournament 1 (1999) players have been using movement (Korean back dash cancelling + sidestepping) to avoid these guessing situations and create whiff opportunities however with Tekken 8 having nerfed movement  (With season 2 they have buffed side steps which is nice but back dash cancelling still feels horrible) you will find yourself at times being forced to guess on a 50/50.  I think some of the hit effects are too much. When Clive activates heat and starts doing through his moves it really takes away from the fight and is too distracting.   Every member of the roster got some new tools coming into Tekken 8.  Characters have new single hit and combo strings to change how their game play looks and feels. Some users may find characters play vastly different than their previous entries (Jack-8) is a great example of this.  I think it is important that characters feel unique and have clear defined strengths and weaknesses. I am unsure what approach the developer team are taking with Tekken 8. But it feels to me that characters are starting to feel similar and lose their identity which is a first for a series that has so many unique and interesting characters. Take King for example. Does he need to have the best counter hit string in the game (DF+2,1) which you can hit confirm for a full combo? This does not make sense to me. As a wrestler type character he should be more focused on doing big single hits and using his cool chain throws.   There are currently 14 characters in the game with the guard break mechanic (Bryan, Clive, Devil Jin, Feng, Heihachi, jack, Kuma, Lidia, Panda, Paul, Reina, Shaheen, Steve, Yoshimitsu) which will break through your block and guarantee a follow up vs you.  In Tekkn 7 only two characters had this functionality (Lidia and Fahkumram) with Bryan also has a unique version of this mechanic since Tekken 3 (Taunt). Seeing it become such a normal part of the game really has made it no longer feel special.   With the latest update to the game (Season 2) we were expecting the developers to tone down how aggressive the game is and show us what defensive options they were working on. Since the latest patch characters across the board have become even stronger and more oppressive. More characters have access to 100+ dmg combos without rage and new tools to force you to block and guess on a 50/50 as you cannot use movement to escape situations. Chip damage is still a massive issue and heat lasts for too long when activated.  There are also currently some game breaking bugs from characters such as jack and Paul that have new moves that seem to have slipped past testing and are causing interactions that were not intended. It being only day 3 of season 2 more bugs could be found in the coming days/weeks. Hopefully we get an emergency patch to fix them.  [h2] Closing thoughts [/h2]  I am not sure what the future holds for the game.    I feel like Bandai Namco have been developing Tekken 8 to be enjoyable for the user on the attack without thinking how does it feel to be the user on the defending side.  Just because being on the offensive feels good doesn't mean being on the defending side has to feel bad. But with the core systems in place for Tekken 8 that is exactly how the game feels. From speaking with casual and pro players it does not seem that either group is happy with the direction the game is going.   I think the developers have lost sight of what made Tekken so much fun. It wasn't big flashy hit effects, over powered moves, characters having no defined weaknesses.  [list] [*] It was the unique characters and their specifics strengths. [*] It was seeing someone put years into a character and mastering what their specific game plan was and aspiring to be that great. [*] It was being a new player and seeing a clip of someone moving around the screen fast thinking ""Wow how are they moving like that??"". [*] It was the people who took the time out of their day to host online and offline events just for people to show up and play their favourite fighting game. [*] It was seeing people coming together from different countries to compete and change their lives [/list]  [b] It was the community.[/b]  And right now it feels like the developers are no longer listening to the community.  You can do as many collaborations and have as many guest characters as you want. If no one is around to play the game who will purchase the future dlcs you make?  I am lucky enough that I have a healthy offline scene of cool people who play for fun and want to improve. I hope the developers can open up a bit more with the community and maybe reach out for more feedback on future patches or ideas they have.  Everybody who purchased Tekken 8 loves the series. We just want to see it go in a different direction than the current one.  All the best   o/"

UDATE#2: Added Note as of 6/4/24:   BATTLE PASS ROUND 1 has ended and literally nothing replaced it. Menus are missing or empty. I did not buy it and frankly don't care- But I want people scoping these reviews to see that in a $70 game, Namco is late on a seamless Battle Pass for this ""Live Service"" Game.   Absolutely hilarious.   The hits keeps coming!  UPDATE #3 7/21/2024: They did it- Namco really did.   They added in-game advertisements to a stage for NIKE shoes... Namco just spent an HOUR at a panel discussing Nike Foamposite Tekken shoes and the BOX they come in... at EVO?! WTF!  Nike is historically known for Sweatshops and ruining communities in 3rd world countries. Why put this in the game? GREED STRIKES AGAIN!  Chipotle too!?   You know, the restaurant chain that is mainly in the US? Yeah- You can earn in-game content by beating King in the battle lounge starting 7/23. This game and all of the additions to it are not for the community or for the playerbase- It seems to be all for Ads, selling stuff that has little to do with the playerbase and is prioritized to make money for Namco.   I already paid $70. So did you (or even more).   Please don't support this. If you love Tekken- don't take this lying down. It will continue to get worse as Namco uses these scummy and dishonest tactics to squeeze as much money and profit as possible... Namco is using these moments to test what they can get away with.

Players expected the stage to be included. It was never announced i would be paid content. Lidia's stage was free...   LOL Original Post (because it continues to evolve)  I am sad about the MTXs and the lazy, absolutely disgusting reused assets from Tekken 7 filling their introductory Battle Pass. These items were held back from launch on purpose just to be dumped in this battle pass. If they are not from Tekken 7- take a look at Tekken Tag 2... Again, reused assets.  These scummy MTXs and Battle Pass were purposefully not discussed before launch and was added 2 months after launch- to sidestep reviews and negative reports. Don't let NAMCO ignore us or move on from this.  This is not Tekken.  This is an example of creating a problem purposefully and selling the solution.   DLC characters if not purchased cannot be labbed against in 10 second drop-in battle replays- a  feature advertised and promoted before launch and in the base-game before MTXs and DLC  were announced or released. Why?    Why is an UNREAL and Blender BALL asset (you can't even defend this Namco) being an item on the battle pass? This has got to be one of the scummiest and laziest battle passes I have ever seen in a game period- And it was  $70 on top of that. NAMCO should be ashamed! To put it in perspective- this ball can be added into UE by making 4-6 clicks.  I know why...

My tummy felt weird—[b]'twas butterflies![/b] I was giddy with excitement. I was looking forward to a game for the first time in forever! And it was a game from a franchise I did not care for and from a genre I don't even like. It was an [i](Orthodox)[/i] Christmas miracle! Then and there, I decided—[b]I must play it day 1![/b] As fate would have it, I had just enough TF2 keys sitting in my inventory to fund this desire of mine. So, I did.  To pass the time until it fully came, [b]I played the demo, loving every second of my 23 hours spent with it.[/b] Sure, its content offering was small: only 4 (out of 32) playable characters, the first battle of the story mode, the intro section of the Arcade Quest mode, and a few Super Ghosts fights that let me reach only the [i]Warrior[/i] rank. But it's the motion of the ocean that counts! And, oh boy, [b]did it rock my boat![/b] The 26th just couldn't come soon enough.  The gameplay shocked me by how easily I jelled with it. Fast, flashy, and furious, yet it was welcoming to a complete noob like myself. I was loving the learning process, and it didn't feel overwhelming. I even managed to get gud at doing some simple combos and air juggling, so that's nice. And I love the new gameplay addition—the [b]Heat[/b] system. Being able to stop my opponent's attack flow by using the [b]Heat Burst[/b] attack, which is uninterruptible, is music to my ears. Sure, you can easily block it, but this is where the fun begins—[b]trying to time it, [i]just right![/i][/b] Plus, the [b]Heat Engager[/b] and [b]Heat Smash[/b] [i](I do be engaging in smashing)[/i] attacks can be used to extend combos and deal even more damage in the process. Simply majestic. The trade-off is that [b]Heat[/b] only lasts 15 seconds. But do you really need more than that? Sometimes less is more, you know.  Speaking of cool attacks, [b]Rage Art[/b] is present once again. This is essentially a super funky high-damage special move you can only do when your health is low. I can't count the number of times using it saved my noob behind from dying. And I gotta say, they are always a treat to watch. [b]This superbly animated sequence, combined with the game's insane visuals, sparks joy each and every time I watch one play out.[/b]  And all the fighting is [i]extra[/i] spiced up by the crazy amount of special effects on the screen each punch, kick, grab, or flying leg kick thrown produces. I can't explain why, but I love the sight of them. [b]It makes watching the punch land that much more oh-so-satisfying.[/b] The animations are also fantastic, further adding to the amazing feel of the combat.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260998 The visuals are simply insane. [i][b]Unreal Engine 5[/b][/i] shines, and so do daddy Kazuya's massive [i]pecs[/i]! Everything, from the arenas, some with multiple rooms you can blast your opponent into, to the character design, is superb and extremely rich in detail. Just amazing stuff. But there's one complaint from me—[b]Paul lost his iconic hair and looks like a Karen[/b] (why [i]Bamco?[/i]).   Also, if you enjoy character customization as much as I do (a lot), then the Arcade Quest mode will be your wet dream. Here, all bets are off, and we'll get free reign over how our fighters look. Will they look wacky? Yes. Creepy? Also yes. Lewd? [b]Hopefully.[/b] Giving players more customization options and freedom is always a plus in my book!  Lastly, the over-the-topness of the story seems to be intact.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260668 I can't wait to see what one of gaming's most dysfunctional families, the Mishimas, is up to. Likely a lot of half-naked men fighting each other, preferably near a cliff, volcano, or maybe a cliff overlooking a volcano. We shall see.  Simply put, [b]it's all (gonna be) perfect![/b]  And after having written 99 reviews, my 100th review will be the first and last [i]improper[/i] one. But [i]Tekken 8[/i] deserved this sacrifice, as it reignited my passion for gaming when no other game could.  So, thank you, [i]Tekken 8.[/i] Thank you to all the developers who poured their hearts and souls into this game. Lastly, thanks to all of you, top bananas, for coming to my [b]TEK[/b]talk. I hope you all enjoy [i]Tekken 8[/i] as much as I am.  [i]And if you want to see [b]proper[/b] reviews, 10/10 dentists recommend the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40407656/]Gospel of Sv. Prolivije."
191985909,english,1,1778820,Devs teach people to block by blocking anyone whining about their game. Community's opinion is treated like shit and goes right into the toilet. They try to add nonsense flashy shits instead of stabilizing it. And it works like every piece of code comes from a different competing team. YES it's a fckn hackathon.
168337995,english,0,1778820,"Despite all the 5 balance patches, the game is a complete mess. Granted it is better than it was at launch, but the amount of busted op moves is still insane. So few characters have well defined strengths and weakness. Its just a case of find your 3 op moves on that character, spam the crap out of them. Defence does not matter anymore, side stepping is so weak, so many moves have insane plus frames and give 100% follow ups. I loved t7, and was so excited for t8 but this game isnt fun. I can count the amount of good enjoyable fights on one hand. In 88 hours, thats a joke."

156907181,english,1,1778820,"The game is amazing and incredibly enjoyable to play! While my main characters were Nina and Hwoarang in the previous games, I made the decision to switch to Jin, and he is undeniably cool, especially with the wing effect in his design. I'm playing on my trusty 6-year-old laptop equipped with a GTX 1070. Not only does it run smoothly at 60 fps on medium settings, but the graphics also look absolutely awesome.  The online experience is flawless; I can't recall encountering any laggy games, and there are a lot of offline modes for you to enjoy, with Ghost Battle being a personal favorite.  I absolutely recommend this game; it promises an abundance of entertainment.  _____ >> Update: I nominated Tekken 8 for the categories below for Steam Award 2024:  > ""Best Game on Steam Deck Award"" (although, I don't have Steam Deck)  > ""Best Game You Suck At Award"" (yup, true!)  > ""Sit Back and Relax Award"" :)"
157090561,english,1,1778820,"Tekken 8 is a real treat for any fan of the franchise, with little nods and homages to it's previous instalations and a true celebration of how good can fighting games still be. Not only it respects it's audience, It's also an improvement over it's predecessor in every single way and stands alongside 3 as the best game in the series.   Not enough people praising how a game that looks this good is running this well as well. I don't think I've seen many games look as stylish and as beautiful as this game does. The movements and combos are meaty, the sounds are punchy and give feedback, a real technical marvel.  I only wished there were more unlockables like the old school entries, it would feel much better unlocking the characters as you finish stuff as it also would give you an incentive to play more on the down times and to give more meaning to complete other modes. The online functionality is working perfectly, had absolutely no problems playing against strangers and friends alike, except for getting my butt kicked, but that's a granted.   If you're still not convinced, remember it still has Kuma in it, and if that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will."

192049829,english,0,1778820,"💀 1,100+ hours to end up with season 2. I've played this game almost every day since release. I loved Tekken 8. It wasn’t perfect, but it felt like high speed chess especially for someone new to fighting games. Now? It's overly aggressive, and most matches feel like coin flips thanks to constant 50/50s.  -Damage is completely out of control  -Pressure is nonstop. Defense gets punished harder than offense  -Some characters straight up feel like final bosses  -It’s so offense heavy I feel like I lose just for trying to KBD  Until they fix the balance and bring back some defense, I’m tapping out of ranked. Maybe even the game entirely. This was my favorite game. :(  (Yes, I'm writing this after an unholy loss streak. Let me cope.)"
165228643,english,0,1778820,"Disappointing is an understatement when it comes to Tekken 8.   This game I will admit I was hyped. Seeing the game play and all the crazy stuff they added looked interesting. Oh boy I was wrong. This game is just a party game that gives anyone a chance to win. You could outplay someone 9-1 but you have to remember the opponent has that 1 and they destroy you because they press their special win button (heat). Heat is a pretty big problem, the single player mechanic it gives isn't fun. I hope they balance heat out but we will see in the future.   I've played ranked for at least 150 hrs getting to the top ranks and I can tell you that ranked and the online play is flawed in many ways. The ranking system is really bad, if you get demoted you have a chance to get that rank back again. It isn't like Tekken 7 when you get demoted you get sent all the way back. But I think this is more for the casual gamer so they don't get demoralised which I understand but why allow it for high ranks? Don't get me started with the plugging (rage quitting) that comes with this game. 7/10 matches you will get a rage quit because the bans are manual from their end. The ban system is really whack, I could hop on like Fariborz or LawofEngland with my macros and not get punished for it. Even if I get banned I can use family share to hop onto another account.   Tekken shop is a disaster, I love getting costumes that modders themselves put into the game for free. The devs had the audacity to screw them over by DMCAing them all so they had to take their mods down. Also the devs have made it super clear they really want to focus on the Tekken shop for obvious reasons because it is their second hand income.   I will change this review when things get fixed and that but I don't suggest at the current state of the game to get it. I will say get it on a sale or wait for patches that fix the problems.   Update Season 2: Soul Calibur 6 devs ruined the game by adding 50/50 which makes the game 2 touch, there is still no skill in the game. Anyone can literally win against a solid player because not everyone is perfect with defence. It is a shame that the game is getting tarnished like this, the copium is gone. o7  Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
166573886,english,0,1778820,"After putting a good amount of hours into the game and reaching High purple/Low blue ranks, I can honestly say that this is the least amount of fun I've ever had with a Tekken game. The amount of catering to new players and spamming playstyles makes the game feel like a coinflip. The introduction of armored powercrush moves, the heat system as a whole, and the return of rage arts makes the game feel like garbage. Movement/sidestepping doesn't feel as rewarding when the opponent can just mash 2+3 and catch you regardless of positioning. The roster is great....the only problem is that you don't see 80% of it in online matches because King/Dragonov/Victor/Reina exist.  For $80 I could have gifted all of my friends a coinflip simulator instead and had about the same amount of fun.  Every match feels the exact same. Apply pressure>Opponent activates heat>Negative frames>Opponent 50/50's>Block for neutral frames>Opponent Powercrushes>Hard knockdown>Wakeup>Block>Take 30% of healthbar from chip damage>Punish>Combo>Opponent Rage Art/Heat Burst>Round lost. Literally every game.   More floor/wall breaks, untechable grabs in certain situations, Dragonov, Losing health on certain inputs that are 100% necessary for relevant combo damage, Dragonov, GOD AWFUL TRACKING/MOVEMENT, No penalty/reward when an opponent ""plugs"", Dragonov, extremely poor matchmaking balance, poor character balance, fan service, the list goes on.  I had high hopes for Tekken 8, but honestly I'm just disappointed. Will likely stick to 2D fighters where things work as intended and make sense.  60% win rate and still deranking. GG Harada.  MONETIZATION IS NOT THE ISSUE."
159573686,english,0,1778820,"Anyone remember back when in Tag 2 Harada said it was wrong to release characters as paid DLC in a fighting game? Then he backtracked on Tekken 7, where the total DLCs cost more than the base game. Then he went even further beyond in Tekken 8 and nerf the customization items, so you have to pay to get more clothing options. What is going to get nerfed in Tekken 9 next? Paying for song choices?  I paid for the ultimate edition just to support this franchise, despite the sh*tty golden clothing no one ever wears... but had I known this in-app purchases would become a thing for Tekken 8. I honestly wouldn't have bothered.  Guess I will learn my lesson for the next Tekken.  EDIT: THE NIBBARINOS AT BAMCO ADDED BATTLE PASS? AYO WTF?!"

178123323,english,0,1778820,"Edit: 4/1/2025  The Devs just released the worst balance patch they probably ever could have for this game. They doubled down on the features that the entire community disliked and told us that this was a patch that would give us more defensive options. By defensive options they meant here are more plus frame moves to force your opponent to block and guess and you need to out mash your opponent for optimal gameplay.  The developers at this point obviously think the community is a bunch of kids who dont know what they want and they absolutely know best so we should just all take it.  Screw that this game sucks ass, do not buy it for Season 2 till they make significant changes.  Original Review: Balance aside, the game launched and then an updated added an in game store revealing why we were missing cosmetics from Tekken 7. Then the battle pass came, and now whenever you login you get 20 notifications saying you got x item or check out the battle pass.  It feels very scummy and they didnt allow season pass owners to get a stage with Heihachi. They are just trying to suck the money out of the playerbase."

159548573,english,0,1778820,"This game is in a very though position to talk about for me. The design behind Tekken 8 forces you to forget almost everything you already know from Tekken, in a fundamental perspective. Characters have lost their identity in general because of game design itself. Most of the cast have a very powerful 50/50, momentun is not a thing since the game greatly benefits you for mashing. The more you mash, the farther you can climb, theres no other way to say this. There is just way too many powerful strings that will make you eat one 50/50 after another. Completely removing one way to play and forcing another feels wrong and I can't understand this game, it's just casino simulator. I've been playing Tekken for almost 10 years and this just feels like something else and I cannot say what it is.  Rank system is garbage and frustrating. It's just not fair to be going with like 7 to 9 win streak in a higher rank (talking about bushin, tekken king, kishin and so on) and only be getting 100 to 200 points maximum per match, and when you lose ONE match (not the ft2, just one match) you lose 1.500 points in just o n e match, even if it is one rank higher. This is just unfair. It would make sense in a lose streak, not in a win streak.  Characters have no real weaknesess, power crush mid that is also heat engager AND safe is stupid. There is a lot wrong with this game and I don't feel like it will be getting fixed anytime soon, I do actually belive that it will become worse if the standard balancing keep going in the casino direction (Eddy).  If you are not playing offense offense offense in this game, you are just dead. Even if you have good defense, the punish you usually get from reading your opponents is not a big of deal most of the time (you can tell by the rage art not being universally launch punishable). Theres soooo many bad decisions in this game that I can't see myself playing much more of this. It's tiring, not fun and stressful.  I think I don't even need to say anything about microtransactions coming out of nowhere, a BUNCH of them added in just a few days. Tekken Shop and Battle Pass??? Battle pass is just greedy since it's just a bunch of items from Tekken 7 and retextures. They didn't even put some efforts in hiding it.  In a much more casual level, this game is amazing, looks awesome and feels very good to play, but thats about it."
160056517,english,1,1778820,"One line review: Tekken8 is amazing.  Slightly expanded review: Probably the biggest leap in quality since Tekken2->3, 8 refines the mechanics from T7, adds modern controls a la SF6, hugely improves the graphics and sound, adds cross play and PvP rematches and makes the game much more accessible to boot. It also adds a real money shop, which, well, is not popular, but is also entirely ignorable.  The sound in particular is great - a blocked quick jab might sound a bit mid, but most hits sound like a damn gunshot and add a heck of a lot to the atmosphere.  The cast of characters is also diverse and fascinating, from giant hugely hard hitting war robots to a hyperfast peruvean coffee-saleswoman who likes nothing more than doging your attacks to hit you from the back, literal devils and demons, a chavvy kind of boxer, a hotheaded taekwando expert, happy shopper bruce lee, a giant championship wrestler who think he's a cat, two kinds of bear, knock-off magic Blade, a gun-toting cyro-frozen irish assassin, a french spymaster who thinks karambit knives are somehow acceptable in a fist fight, a space alien octopus robin hood ninja thing, an egyptian lady who has the literal god of war stuck in her hand somehow and a good two dozen more. More will come with DLC, ofc, but there are plenty to choose from and lots to experiment with.  The really great thing about tekken is that it has an almost abyssal level of depth, with so many mechanics, both new and old. Now this might seem like it would make the game hard to learn, especially if you're new to the series, but it's also really intuitive. You have four buttons, left and right kicks, and left and right punches. That's it! If you want to do a quick right left combo, you press right punch, then left punch. Easy.  If you have good timing, are patient and understand distancing even a little bit, you really don't even need a tutorial, it's that welcoming.  Now, all the above is really only about the PvP mode(s). SP has always been a bit thin in tekken games, but fwiw, I think it's probably at it's best here; there's the campaign which to its credit has tried to mix things up a bit, character episodes which also focus on the non-mainstream characters a bit more, arcade and arcade quest mode and also ghost battles. I guess it's alright? Tekken ball makes a return from 3, which is great, but you can't play it online for no good reason I can think of (e: you can, im just a big dummy, see comments), but the SP definitely takes a back-seat to the PvP modes.  There's also a bunch of nice touches, like how you can play as Tekken3 Jin, how the characters have rivalries and neat fight intros with their nemeses, replays which have advice when you watch them, kazuya's tits are FINALLY splashed all over the main menu*, there is the customary Tekken silliness, weirdness and ott anime moves and also Heihachi Mishima, possibly literally the most terrible person in the world, and easily the worst parent ever has died**. And then reincarnated as his own illegitimate daughter who is, if anything, even more horrifying to fight against. And she also has the devil gene that is basically the reason for everyone fighting in the first place, because of course she does.  One of my most favourite things is hwoarang mirror matches, which usually devolve into showing off, doing the flashiest moves you can and then get to the point where you are just improvising and re-interpreting each others combos in a sort of synchronised dance-off. It's just amazing to be a part of.  Edit: ok im going to write a bunch more about hwoarang and how his depiction in this game is just amazing. See taekwando, as a practiced olympic/ competitive sport, is quite a lot different than it was originally. Now, its about scoring points by, ideally, a spin kick to the head which counts for the most. So, in this game, hwo has a LOT of flashy high kicks which do a lot of damage, while smaller jabs and kicks serve to put the opponent in a place where high kicks count. It's kinda wonderful, really. Even better is that he had a tutor, Baek Doo San, who exemplifed the older more traditional style and now he has some of Baek's moves, rounding out his repertoire and showing he leant from his tutor.  *: Now you can choose which character you see  **: He's alive now, ofc  If you want an example of how silly it can get, here's Panda winning the tournament and then failing to deal with a chair: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dOp9YUJ_ow  I like it.

Even from a casual perspective, i can't imagine this being fun in the long term.

188007133,english,0,1778820,"While currently the overall reviews for this game are positive, most of the players that initially played and left their positive review are unfortunately gone.  The game is simply not fun to play at the state it's in. The character balancing is almost non existent in my opinion. The characters that were strong at the launch of the game are still strong a year later. They have pushed out balance changes during the year nerfing some of those characters, but it wasn't enough.  The 3D aspect of the 3D fighting game is more of a gimmick now than it ever has been. If you try to utilize the 3D aspect and sidestep, you can and most likely will at times get punished for trying seeing as a lot of moves track absurdly. The tracking should be heavily changed and nerfed, if you sidestep properly you should be rewarded, the opponent shouldn't just auto-realign to you during their strings. Some moves track right or left and you have to sidestep into the other direction. Some of those same moves track almost a full 180 (some track, but not that much), which leads to confusion as you will get hit when you're sidewalking and are almost behind the opponent.  With a lot of moves tracking where they shouldn't, if you add in absurd hitboxes you get the current condition of Tekken 8. Phantom hitboxes are a thing and I think that's fine as long as it's not too much. But if you add in the fact that when you sidewalked and are beside your opponent while he's doing his move. If you try to attack him before he's done you can and will get hit first yourself. By attacking you extend your hurtbox and for whatever reason there's a big chance you get hit first. That's just stupid.  Season 2 is around the corner, hopefully we will see some improvements.  EDIT: Season 2 is ass"

189798484,english,0,1778820,"This game Is hands down the worst Tekken ever made to date. First, the game is designed to be a button mashing fest where low level and high level gameplay look identical due to the extreme lack of depth in this game. Secondly, the monetization is so bad they re-release content from TEKKEN 7 and charge you for it in their battle pass. Thirdly, character move-sets have been homogenized to the point all characters essentially do the same thing. There are no longer interesting play styles and archetypes in this game. Finally, the story has to be one of the worst written, cringe inducing stories I have had the displeasure of playing. At first it was so bad it was good but now, with the inclusion of Heiachis story the story is an absolute joke. I am a huge Tekken fan and have never been particularly good at Tekken. I got to fujin as my highest rank in Tekken 7 and enjoyed every step of the way including the loses. There was always something to learn and something to improve at. There is always a point in all fighting games where they become 50/50 fiestas and if you enjoy that all power to you, but one thing is certain, this game is not Tekken anymore."
191785769,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 is a game where at ""Tekken King"" you will run into players who cannot break throws, panic rage art the frame they get it, mash at -23, and have no idea how to tech roll or get up from the ground. This was called ""Yellow Rank"" in Tekken 7 but ranked in this game is more akin to the Special Olympics."
176382192,english,0,1778820,"Once legendary fighting game series has lost its way.  It's now tainted with shady monetization practices, questionable ""casino"" gameplay mechanics, nonsensical character balancing and each dlc character is guaranteed to be so overpowered at launch... It's near pay to win.   I've been a fan since Tekken 1 and it's bizarre to see where the series has gone. The once focus on real life fighting styles is also gone and replaced with lasers, guns and other projectiles.  The ultimate edition does not include all dlc (even in the first season). Truly something that would make Ubisoft executives proud.  I hope Tekken team starts to focus more on the core gameplay and less on the atrocious  cosmetics.  Update after Season 2  Movement is pretty impressive now. Tekken team hinted for months about this S2 patch that would balance the game and make defense more feasible....however they have doubled down and made the ""casino"" gameplay even more extreme. The most viable strategy now is to rush down your opponent before they rush you. A pretty sad state of affairs could have been avoided if the devs made gradual small changes; instead of one huge patch with very significant changes, withheld from the community until the very launch.  I was excited to pre order the $100 version of the game when it first was announced. Since then there have been: a battle pass and an in game shop added just post launch Paid cosmetics and a paid stage not included in the $100 version of the game and the game now is so far from what Tekken is that it should probably be named something else.  In its current state Tekken 8 is similar to that time you were finished playing the witcher 3 and started watching the netflix adaptation expecting more good content.  After playing since Tekken 1 and being around in the arcade glory days, I guess this is where I get off.  I truly do hope that Harada and crew can get their act together and get this series back to its glory days...I will pass on S2 dlc until then."
191782728,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 is my first Tekken and I main Reina. I love her and this game to pieces. I've always understood why people preferred the defensive playstyle of previous Tekkens, but I enjoyed the aggressive focus of this game. I felt the aggressor should be rewarded for taking risks, not punished. Defence was now something IMPRESSIVE instead of just being a backdash magic 4 fest. You were still REWARDED for good defence despite it being harder.  I understand this game wants to focus on aggression and appealing to new players and I don't see the point of doing Tekken 7 again. But this is terrible guys. Terrible. You've turned most characters' rushdown into the most braindead, button mash fest it's ever been. Defence isn't hard anymore, it's IMPOSSIBLE. Everyone has good Mid/Low mixes regardless of if they deserved it or not. Character identity is being shot down in the street by removing execution and weaknesses. It is NOT FUN to play a character with NO EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS and NO WEAKNESSES. I am a new player who picked up a MISHIMA. Why do you think new players are some TikTok braindead idiots? And why are you trying to appeal to them when Tekken is famously difficult so they're not going to waste their time on it anyway? And why do your changes not even encourage TikTok braindead idiots to play because they, like everyone, are incapable of guessing correctly more than 50% of the time??? Are you guys just homogenising the cast because it's easier to balance? Why do we pay you then?  Not only is the balance of this patch in SHAMBLES because you removed so many character weaknesses so now they're just perfect. This patch is BUGGED too! Paul has an unintentional unblockable. There are numerous camera glitches resulting in unintentional wall splats. Steve qcf1 STILL randomly whiffs. On and on and on, and guaranteed there will be more the longer the patch is up. Not to mention all the new animations look TERRIBLE. Speeding up animations like Feng's qcf1 makes it look unnatural. Or Reina's d2, 1+2 just copy and pasting her 1+2. Pigeon Roll from Dragunov looks silly. Feng's b4, 2 doesn't match his fighting style at all or even look like a real attack. So you're telling me you spent 4 months on this patch not only for it to be unbalanced, but it also lacks ANY SENSE of quality control? What have you guys been doing all this time to not even test for BUGS?  Worst of all, it has been 24 hours since the patch dropped, and you guys haven't reverted the changes, temporarily taken down the servers or even SPOKEN to us. Not even assured us that you're on it and things will be okay. I still have faith you can fix this, but I'm losing faith that you can balance this game or that you care enough about the pros livelihood or what people sacrifice to try get good at this game. You're gonna do this again. Just like you've added hatchet kicks to characters who don't deserve it multiple times. Given characters tracking Hellsweeps multiple times. Given tracking plus on block moves to characters multiple times.   I don't know what you guys need to change to get it together, but change it and GET IT TOGETHER."

175362006,english,0,1778820,"Game's a 50/50 button masher by design. Players are 2 buttons away from dealing 80% of your life with Rage Art or Heat Smash. The Side-Step 3D element is ruined by half of the abilities homing. Blocking is a joke when you get slowed with negative frames or take massive chip damage. Everyone has an easy 50% damage launch combo that takes longer than a turn based RPG. Cheating is Rampant and unmanaged... I could go on and on.  If you are a button masher, or a self hating tryhard that is willing to study an impossible amount of frame data to tilt a 50/50 in your favor, you might enjoy this game. If you are sane and just want a simple game where you tussle and express skill, then I wouldn't call this a true fighting game."
176243761,english,0,1778820,"Despite the quality and polish this game is not worth the money, because how egregious the monetization is. This game does NOT cost 70 dollar. It costs a lot more.

Stages have gameplay impact meaning if you care about getting good you need to buy them and practice on them. Your wallet does impact your ability to improve in this game, and the game cost 70 dollar to start with.   Avoid this game for now. The devs doesn't respect you or your time."

Hardly any counterplay, complete homogenisation of pretty much the entire cast with strong mids and power lows, spike enders at the wall, homing attacks when we were going to ""buff sidesteps.""  Season 1 wasn't perfect, far from it, but we were getting used to it and counterplay was being discovered constantly. Whilst the homogenisation problem was still present, ever since T7 I'd argue, characters did indeed feel unique. Now everyone can be plus, have strong counter hits, hit the wall from any point on the stage, just do anything and everything.   In summary, this game doesn't feel like Tekken anymore. Genuinely a hollow shell of what could've been a great game. I'm out, 1.3 seconds."

163347987,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 has all the makings of a great game, but once again, Namco seems determined to fumble the ball when it counts most. We're just a couple of months into the game's life, and instead of tackling real issues, Namco seems set on sabotaging its own growth.  I can't recommend the game at it's current state. Devs are either overworked or completely incompetent. Every balance patch they break more things than they fix. Also they would rather change the core game system instead of target nerfing a single character, which results in even more unintended bugs and interactions in the game (broken wall combos, floors not breaking, etc.). They tried to nerf the obnoxious Azucena WR3,4 and it ended up being a buff because you can't even punish it on whiff.  Accidental buffs? Sound familiar? They did the exact same thing when they wanted to nerf Akumas techroll catch in Tekken 7. Instead of target nerfing the problematic interaction, they made a system-wide nerf to tech catches, which ended up taking away a layer of mindgame at the wall for every character. And the best part is, Akuma could still do the tech catch. They've done this many times before and they will do it again, because this is one of the most stubborn group of people that will blame the fanbase before they admit they did something wrong.  After a huge backlash on one balance patch, people demanded more transparency from the devs. So, what did we get? A brief burst of activity from the game directors on Twitter (which lasted about a month) and some half-hearted explanations buried in the patch notes. But they still sneak in changes without telling anyone. They made a huge change to the matchmaking system that resulted in people not finding any matches. I have been searching for a match, while writing this review and I found a single match with a player more than 5 ranks away from mine.  Bandai as a publisher is also not new to the anti-consumer practices. A $70 game is getting a ""battle-pass"" 2 months into it's release with filler, throwaway cosmetics that were available for free in the previous games.  One of the most knowledge check-heavy characters, Eddy, is a $6 DLC character, which you can't lab against if you don't buy him (can't even take over your own character in the replay).  I'm not the biggest modder but the modding scene is a huge part of the Tekken community. Instead of offering cosmetics that people would actually want to pay for, Namco decided to release laughable garbage and go after the modders just so they could squeeze out as much money as possible from their battlepass.  The balance is a mess (see Dragunov, Azucena etc.) but that could be remedied in the upcoming balance patches (lol).  Ranked is also full of pluggers. Instead of getting an automatic win when your opponent plugs, like in every other game, namco decided that its better to keep an excel spreadsheet of the players reported on twitter and manually issue bans to them every other patch... yeah.  Nobody's talking about this, but one of the main reasons I love tekken and not any other fighting game is because of the quality of character animations. All the moves felt like they had weight to them and looked very fluid. However, since the later Tekken 7 seasons (see Lidya's whole moveset, wallbounce) it has taken a huge dive. Some of the new animations in Tekken 8 are outright terrible (tornado animation, everybody getting a backflip move that make the character look weightless ex. Jin). This all culminated with Eddy that had his whole movelist reworked and now looks like he's sporadically jumping between animations when he does a move (no windup, no recovery, moves worse than an MK character). However, this is the least of the games problems. It looks gorgeous otherwise and devs did a great job. This is my favorite game franchise, which I've been playing since Tekken 3 on PS1 and I hate to see it in its current state, but the only way to get through to namco is to stop giving them more money. At the end of the day all they care about is money and this will keep happening if you keep supporting them with your wallets.  In short, Tekken 8 has potential, but until Bamco get their act together, I'd steer clear of this mess. I know this review will read like Im venting, because I am. Im sad to see this happen to my favorite franchise. There's a reason I have 3000 hours in Tekken 7 and just as many playing it offline with people I've met through this game that I can call my lifelong friends. UPDATE:  The upcoming patch seems to be promising. Obviously overtuned characters are getting nerfed and they seem to be providing a lot of free content for damage control. The game needs a few more of updates like these and it will be in a great state. I will update my review accordingly. UPDATE 2:  They were just weathering the storm. Now that people have quieted down, they release Genmaji Temple stage as a separate DLC, not included in season pass or ultimate edition. This company is a joke UPDATE 3: Clive happened. Update 4: Online is basically unplayable. The netcode is absolutely terrible. I dont think I can play another 8 years of this. Update 5: Season 2 is out. Game is balanced if everyone is a broken top 1. Devs are not listening. I would stay away"
191970507,english,0,1778820,"I've loved Tekken since playing T2 in arcades as a kid. I was never great, but enjoyed long sets with friends. Tekken 8 heat system was rough in Season 1 - it messed with character expression and turned matches into Heat spamming.  But Season 2 is a complete mess. It’s not Tekken anymore, just a button-mashing simulator with no depth.  New players might enjoy it, but veterans are better off waiting for changes or skipping it entirely."
162329251,english,0,1778820,"They Banned Iran ip for no reason!  I paid for this game and i can't even play it without VPN and of course its gonna effect on my ping and i'm receiving lots of hate comments from the community cz my ping is 130 ... that's not fair, i played this franchise since Tekken 2 released and now here I am, I cant play without VPN. thank you so much btw , the characters are not balance anymore and the game is not technical as it was before, you just need more luck!"
163598774,english,0,1778820,"PROS: The game is fun at a casual level and it is an improvement on Tekken 7 in terms of load times, graphics, and single-player content. The story is brief and entertaining and the new characters are unique and well-designed.  CONS: The dev team is convinced that making the game more aggressive and flashy (think eSports) is going to make newcomers and casuals more interested in the Tekken series. Personally, I'm not a fan of the gameplay changes. The new universal mechanic (heat) is basically a way to make the game more like advanced rock-paper-scissors and less about skill and game knowledge. I think that one of the cool things about Tekken is how much depth and skill expression there is to the game and heat is a lazy way to even the playing field. Aside from that, there are a lot of issues with the game that have yet to be resolved. There is still no anti-cheat of any kind. The netcode is quite bad for 2024 unless you're playing with a 4-5 bar wired connection. PC players that can't run the game at 60 fps force their opponents to play in slow motion (there is no minimum benchmark score needed to play online). The ranked system is a total mess and it is clear that the devs designed the ranked system to make it easy for new players to see their rank go up without actually getting better at the game. You can't lab pay to win DLC characters in replay mode unless you own them. They added an incredibly low-effort cosmetics store and battlepass system in a $70 game - you also can't buy anything directly, you have to buy 'Tekken coins' which means to get one $5 skin you'd have to pay $10 to have enough coins. Don't expect these problems to get fixed anytime soon. Overall, even though the game is fun, I would not recommend it. I think it's not worth getting into if there are other fighting games that seem equally appealing to you."
162059122,english,0,1778820,"Someone on the balancing team is a few sandwiches short of a picnic and it's really hurting the game.

172467636,english,0,1778820,"This is a game that has simply hurt me too many times. I don't mind strong characters, I really don't. I could get my balls handed to me on a silver platter and still have fun, but that's just the thing. Sometimes, this stuff just ain't fun. Maybe it's just me but as a person who's been playing since Tekken 7, I'll just get to the point, I'm not going to say anything like, ""OH, old Tekken good new Tekken bad"", in fact i really enjoy the heat system and overall aggression. But it feels just, way too mashy? You get so minus to a point where sidestepping is literally not an option, and sidestepping itself is already really tricky to get the hang of yet very rewarding, sometimes however it simply feels impossible and you feel trapped and as a player it sucks. I play Paul, Jin, Kazuya, Leo, Dragonouv, and Devil jin, and I notice that I only do well once I start ""cheesing"" which might mean many things to many different people. So I'll be a bit more blunt and just say what my heart feels as of this moment, writing this review.   Neutral does not exist  At least that what it feels like to me, I don't see a point in doing a heat engager cancel in neutral when i'm gonna end up JUST AS MINUS if I had missed it anyways. Countless times I would think, ""Yes this is a safe distance, I will engage heat to utilize my resource advantage over the enemy. Only for them to just RA in response and magically magnetically gravitate towards me? Perhaps this is just a skill issue on my end but aside from that. Some times you feel extremely boxed in. Characters like King, Lidia, just sorta lock you in and once again, this might be a knowledge check, and I might just be bad but keep in mind I'm like the average purple rank. I have a Tekken King level friend that claims I am Kishin level, yet whenever I try to climb the ranks it just feels impossible? I swear I'd be on a 6 winstreak, lose once, and I'd be where I statred. Became a bit of an inside joke where we'd celeberate our ranks by going  ""Hey guys! I ranked from up from mighty ruler to mighty ruler!""  And I wish this was a joke but occasionally I would throw a demotion game, just so I can repromote and get that boost.   Ranking is messed up Footsies feel off There's no other game like tekken but sometimes it just hurts.  I'm open to any comments but I'm really just not in the mood for any git gud or tips. Too heartbroken for that.  I want to love Tekken but as I kept playing I realised that this is NOT healthy for me. I'd play Tekken with my friends and it'd always end in me going into a complain session. The worst part is that they'd just agree with me. All my complaints about random mid combo sideswaps, input eating, sidesteps turning into jumps and ducks, dropping combos because of wall jank. I wanted to be wrong, I wanted to be told ""Hey, ur just bad, here's a tip on how to overcome this"" But no. I'm sure some of you had those moments, maybe they're a lot more rarer than mine, how knows.   But yeah, I'm writing this, with pain and salt in my mind, having just uninstalled it after being deleted by my buddy playing Lidia and Reina.   Tekken is good game. but it's just not good for ME. So, I'm quitting for now.  Maybe I'll come back after a year or two, or when the heihachi DLC drops.  Maybe then it might feel better.   EDIT 25/9/2024 I recently reinstalled Tekken 8 after seeing heihachi, i got filled with hope and motivation. I joined some ranked matches and immediately get reminded of everything I had complained about in the above statement. Maybe it really is a skill issue, but once more.   Can't sidestep because I get locked in. People would rather mash their way out instead of going for parries and sidesteps or simply blocking and waiting for a gap. Which is fine! IF, it didn't work like 80% of the time.  Neutral? What's that? It's a contest of who can overwhelm the other guy first. Footsies only last for like 5 seconds before somebody, be it me, or the opponent, feels the compelling need to throw out some random heat move.  But compared to before, my head is clearer.   So I have suggestions, some of you might like it, some of you might not.  Ngl, KEEP OFFENCE THE SAME. I honestly think this is the most ""FUN"" Tekken in the same way that Guilty Gear STRIVE is the most ""FUN"" Guilty Gear to the masses.  My only problem is that as a player of both games, Guilty Gear has a more streamlined defence, block high, block low, occasionally try a parry and dust grab.  Tekken? You give me side steps, you give me Highs, Mids and Lows to worry about. You give me not just grabs, but different kinds of grabs from tackles, to feints, each with their own unique uses for repositioning, and unique ways to break them too. You give me power crushes, you give me while standings, all these moves, and I get to use NONE of them because I'm minus 100 and the Reina/Lydia/Lars/Victor/Jun is bullying me with their 50/50s and homing stance locks. Once again, maybe to the better players she's not an issue but wouldn't it be nice to actually be able to sidestep in what is basically the ONLY game worth playing that allows it?  TL:DR, Just buff defence. That's it, the options are there, just give the players more opportunities to use them and honestly the game will feel so much better.   Once again, I am the average purple rank player, I play this game for fun, climbing ranks? Sure it's nice to climb but at the end of the day what everybody wants is some GOOD A$$ TEKKEN. Maybe I'm just too defensive in an offense oriented game, but a majority of my playstyle's strength comes from defence. Maybe that's why I feel so limited?  EDIT 2 AS OF 26/10/2024  This time this is a salt review, THE GAME IS STILL TRASH NOTHING HAS CHANGED PEOPLE CAN JUST GET AWAY WITH SO MUCH FORCED 50/50s I DONT GET IT, I CAN'T SIDESTEP, I CAN'T PUNISH AFTER A SUCCESSFUL SIDESTEP (Though I skill issue on my part, I'm talking about the moves that just send the characters flying so far i.e. dragonouv smash) BACK TURN COMBOS ON THE ON THE WALL ARE STILL BEYOND JANK)   is this Tekken or is this 3d Strive man? Because if that's what your going for, Strive executes the aggression idea WAY BETTER.  You are NOT rewarded for having good defense in this game! (Typed this after losing to a sidestep stance spam jun and Victor with that lanky af CH launcher sweep)  Stuff needs to be more minus on whiff so people can't just throw stuff out willy nilly, that or make it so that sidesteps actually work, I swear, in one ranked session alone I have encountered FIVE SITUATIONS where I have sidestepped so hard, that I swapped sides with the opponent, ONLY TO GET HIT ANYWAYS?????  Good news tho, I reached Blue rank (it's the same issue there too...)  Also, I want characters that are hard to play because they require SKILL to use, not characters that are hard to play because they SUCK. Bamco wtf are you smoking with that DLC money bro.......  Edit fir 26/1/2024 Hey guys, I reached blue rank with 3 characters, Jin Paul, And Heihachi, and I'll be honest. Things haven't changed. My blue rank friend is now a Tekken Emperor and even he still agrees it's sort of the same up there in ramks, that is, mashfest. I've improved as a player and have come to realise that it's not neccessarily the characters in this game that are busted and moreso the game itself being busted. That is all.   Blah blah Defense should be buffed, blah blah 50/50 spamfest you know how it goes.  I do have one new complaint though, some characters just seem to have the weirdest autotracking stuff. You'd sidestep something flawlessly and still magically get hit by the second part of the move as they magically lock onto you.   As riduculous as it sounds, Armoured Core 6 (Another game I have been playing) Is a better and more fun fighting game than Tekken, and it's not even remotely close to a fighting game. Weird.  I'm not even writing this update with salt, I've gotten past the salt and reached the point where I'm just empty?  SEASON2... KMS"
192092168,english,0,1778820,"This prolonged April fools joke is getting a bit annoying, can we get the real season 2 patch now?  On a real note, this patch is the most out of touch thing I have seen in any game that I have ever played. What a great ""Defensive"" patch. This new era of Tekken is so void of character archetypes it's actually crazy. Every character is now a brain dead 50/50 stance character with homing plus frames mids and crazy lows.   Every character utilises the system mechanics exactly the same way. We got heat engage into crouch so of course every character needs a crazy full crouch low to be able to take advantage of that, right?  I don't know if this is fixable and at this point I kinda hope Tekken as a series dies, because Bandai Namco does not deserve more money. Let's hope another 3D fighter gets released that can replace Tekken."

This recent S2 patch, however, has drastically undermined my chances and those of many players like myself. It’s essential to take the art of Tekken seriously for self-improvement, and I’m beginning to question if this game’s current state supports that goal.  I’m not pleased with how this change has affected my character and the game overall. It feels as if I’m being pushed into a play style that doesn’t align with my approach. This patch has been incredibly frustrating and needs urgent attention. Despite all my hard work—practicing, studying my opponents, and analyzing gameplay—it all seems to lose meaning when I’m forced to eat unearned 50/50's and adopt a style more suited to a BlazeBlue character. Losing the essence of my character is something I cannot accept. At this point, I barely recognize who I’m playing and what I'm playing anymore...  Please fix the game that I love and worked so hard to be competent at...."

No brains no knowledge required. tekken 7 ruler ranks are like tekken king/god in this dumbass game. that explains alot   EDIT: SEASON 2 i didnt even download it yet my friend showed it and i am geniuenly disappointed and have 0 faith in them. few characters had stances and thats what that made them different. few characters had homing safe moves and that was their unique feature. tekken 8 just gave everyone everyhting power mids, infinite plus +8 startup braindead mixups, homing moves, while running stance moves.

191713020,english,0,1778820,I dunno man. This game increasingly favors the aggressive style of play and rewards the player for it. more 50/50 gets added to the game and defense feels worse every match.  I dunno why it is such a good feeling for players to framelock someone until their HP bar hits zero. Especially problematic in heat where you just block and pray to not die.   The best defense is offense here which destroys the punishment aspect of the game. I don't even feel like my opponent is reacting to my stuff. They are not thinking about what i'm doing they just force their offense on me and hope i didnt lab every DLC character.

I cannot recommend this game though, because of the despicable MTX practices they have decided to implement AFTER reviews were in. i believe buying costumes is an ok way to try to have fans continue to support the developers (as long as base game customization is great) EXCEPT when you CANNOT buy them directly and instead need to buy a premium in-game currency, as it can (and does) lead to overpaying/overspending. And now they have decided to introduce a battlepass which i believe is completely unnecessary, and another way to try to squeeze money out of players through FOMO. Overall this game is crazy fun and if you can ignore the MTX then please go ahead and buy it if that's what you want to do, but if you're on the fence and unsure whether you'd like it even after trying the demo, i would suggest not buying it to not support these greedy and anti-consumer practices."

191694778,english,0,1778820,"First time i post a review ever because i am baffled, i never seen devs so out of touch with the community...  New season dropped and they made every character into a braindead easy mix up machine without a single buff to defense, from the start of tekken 8 players where vocal about the prominess of easy mix ups and the glaring nerfs to defense compared to past tekken games and yet they do a huge patch with lots of new moves that enphasis on every aspect the players disliked about the game.  No one litterally no one asked for these changes, even new players never asked for more offense in a game that clearly lacks defensive options and is easy to mash button and win like in most Tekken games.  Tekken especially with competetive Tekken 7 scene garnered a reputation of a game that has solid focus on fundamental skill such as movement, neutral and defense and seeing how Tekken 8 nerfed all this aspects is sad, even the tournament views are worse for T8 compared to T7 for how homoginized the characters are and streamlined the gameplay is with new systems.  But i still had hope since things could change for the better. however devs turning a deaf ear on their community that was extremly vocal about all te negative aspects of the game which made the experience worse just to double down on what everyone hates for some fabricated notion that ""it's good for new players"" is incomprehensible when people loved Tekken 7 which was massively succesful for a fighting game."
191720018,english,0,1778820,"I do not recommend Tekken 8 season 2 for these reasons.  -The developers do not understand the characters they design. They see that the character has strengths and weaknesses and continue to not let them have this weakness. Instead, they homogenize the character to be like the others making them overtuned. This was a big issue in Season 1 that made 70% of the roster oppressive. And the game is suppose to favor the aggressor, but it favored the aggressor too much to the point where it will look like a one player game sometimes. There is very little counterplay to these characters. =Season 2 did not address these things, they only made minor defensive changes like being able to side step from crouch and side step buffer. But that is not enough as they decided to buff almost everyone while giving them major/minor nerfs. However, this isn't the only thing that makes it bad. They also killed character identities like Law's WS4 CH DSS not being a thing anymore, Zafina stances, Feng Wei snake dash block, etc. They gave characters like Dragunov some more identity which is cool, but no character should have their identity being killed or overtuned. All they did was buff the weaknesses of each character instead of just letting them have this weakness and just buff their strength instead. But the developers do not understand their character designs. -The developers also did not address any of the dumb tracking some of the moves have like the heat bursts. Yes, some of the Heat bursts like Bryans still track even though they aren't suppose to.  Also removing CH Ki charge is the worse change I've ever seen. No one complained about it and people liked it."

All of this is being included in a game that's plagued with many other issues that need urgent fixing, like wonky netcode, terrible balance and no real penalties for cheaters/rage quitters.

191130721,english,0,1778820,"""For Season 2, we'd like to focus on defense in terms of the lateral aspects of a 3d fighting game.""   Followed by the developers spending over two hours without mentioning any defensive changes and only focusing on more BS 50/50 casino gameplay is hilarious.   Oh right, some genius decided that you should be punished for breaking a throw correctly and take chip damage.   Would not recommend anyone purchasing this game until they actually improve defense/movement to counteract the constant aggression.   [b]EDIT:[/b] Just wanted to add some extra feedback in case the developers become truthful when it comes to taking feedback.  1. Remove Chip Damage completely: Its a garbage mechanic and makes being on the receiving end of heat even more frustrating because even if you block the mix-ups correctly you're still punished enough to where you'll often lose 40% of your life bar from just chip damage and be put in range to where the next mix up will kill you.  2. Buff Movement: Backdash needs to be buffed to bait and create whiffs otherwise Tekken turns into everyone just constant throwing out hitboxes without thinking knowing that at worst they will hit on block and often times be plus still. Sidesteps need tuning to be more reliable since they can fail even if using them in the same situation as one in which they've succeeded previously.  3. Fix Phantom hitboxes/Nerf range of moves/Nerf homing moves/Remove string realignment GLOBALLY: All of these changes will also help with the problem above. People would play a lot slower in neutral which builds tension, makes a defensive more viable and allows there to be more neutral interactions instead of each player trying to bulldoze their way into constantly being in close range forcing a guessing game.  4.Severely nerf heat: I would love to just remove it completely but its already built into the core Tekken system. Instead just make it so that heat is something you have to earn in a game and make it so that once you activate it the meter never stops going down. Remove the ability to regenerate heat from moves/stances. Nerf Heat smashes across the board so that they don't cause stage interactions or wall splat. Heat smashes being so overbearingly strong streamlines a lot of the game play especially against characters like Jin/Heihachi. I would make every heat smash +3 or less on block since even when you block such powerful moves correctly you have to guess again for your life with another unfair mix-up.  5.Lower the plus frames on moves across the board, +5 is crazy for heat dash considering its not even something you have to earn to be able to do when you have heat active. There are also too many high reward moves that are also +6 on block or higher... Why?  6. Remove Unbreakable grabs and guard breaks from the game. They are just way too powerful and mentally taxing to deal with. Guard breaks also often lead to wall splats or wall blasts which makes them low risk for too high of a reward."
191738401,english,0,1778820,"To preface this - it's currently the launch of season 2 of Tekken 8. I like Tekken, I've played Tekken since Tekken 2. I've played every Tekken game to date. I like this franchise so much that I've spent energy following it and playing it over the course of my life.  This game is quite possibly the worst Tekken game I have ever played. I would consider Death by Degrees to be more true to form to Tekken's formula and aesthetic than this game.   You can see right now I have hundreds of hours in this game, you might be asking why? If you don't like it - why spend so much time. Here's why - I have desperately tried to cling onto the idea that if I played enough/ranked up enough it would suddenly click. I've also always liked Tekken and didn't want to drop a franchise I've historically enjoyed so I thought I was missing something.  I wasn't and that point has been proven now.  Tekken 8 was given out to players initially as a review copy without a battle pass addition. Once official release came around a battle pass was added to bypass the review phase. This battle pass and each one afterwards till now contains items which were normally obtained in Tekken games through in-game currency obtained from Online Matches or Arcade mode or even other party modes added in previous games such as Tekken Bowling or Tekken Volleyball.  However with Tekken 8 this was a unwelcome surprise and now it requires real world money.  This is why Tekken 8 now has a asterisk with the message ""This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity"".  This is not one of those times.  With the launch of season 2 they emphasised that the updates would favour defence options a bit more. Currently plus frames are rampant with many moves or heat activations which leave no room at all for you to retaliate and certain characters are utterly broken. I don't mean overpowered either but they have them too.  Paul can currently do f,1+2 into while standing 3 and it will bypass the guarding system and hit every time. To go even further, he can press 2 after that unblockable ws,3 and if you're at the wall, you just got wall splat. Which will possibly lead to you losing the match because you anticipated the move coming and blocked like a normal sane individual (You shouldn't have done that).  There is a plethora of similar issues with the game right now. There are many reasons the game is in the state that it is in but it comes to who's currently in charge. This narrows down to Kouhei Ikeda now being game director and Harada becoming an adviser. All ""heat"" on this issue is directed towards Harada who is sun setting his time with Tekken. All positive notes to take from T8 will be accredited to Ikeda's work on the game. All drawbacks will be learned from for the next game hopefully but ultimately it's Ikeda's series now. Many Soul Calibur developers have transitioned to Tekkens development.  That is the state of Tekken 8's development right now.  There is a bunch of issues why the game is not good right now: Too many plus frames. No actual defensive options. Terrible Heat mechanic. Many moves hitting off axis. Combo damage is incredibly high. Too many stance transitions (Everyone is Lei now apparently). Stock/State Power ups. Chip Damage.  The aesthetic of the previous games' are also lost entirely. T4 still holds the bar for the best with so little to show for it. They only needed a hint of flashy stuff or ridiculous concepts in Tekken. If you look at Clive you can see that's been thrown out the window.  What's also really disappointing is that a lot of players have tried putting the thought into peoples head that previous Tekken games were worse and they don't have the stomach to actually say the series got worse.  It's a really funny twist of fate that Tekken Tag Tournament 2 didn't kill Tekken but Tekken 8 - their most lavish and expensive title to date is doing a better job than Tag 2 ever did."

They don't release normal patches, instead they release shi#ty DLC with characters that have nothing to do with Tekken and they're broken, we were promised that characters that have nothing to do with Tekken wouldn't appear there. Cheaters are still the same, both low ranked and high ranked, the search system is still the same crappy system where it can take 20-30 minutes to find an opponent. Opponents who click anywhere and hit anything with 30-40 defense are just disgusting.

But despite all this banco will release a collaboration with nike and make limited edition watches instead of good patches, congratulations, this is the worst fighting game ever.

Они не выпускают нормальных патчей, вместо этого они выпускают дерьмовые DLC с персонажами, которые не имеют ничего общего с Tekken, и они сломаны, нам обещали, что персонажи, которые не имеют ничего общего с Tekken, там не появятся. Читеры все те же остались, как на низкоранговых, так и на высокоранговых, система поиска все та же дерьмовая, где поиск соперника может занять 20-30 минут. Противники, которые кликают куда угодно и бьют чем угодно с защитой 30-40, просто отвратительны. Противник, который может ударить по воздуху и магическим образом попасть по вам, и при этом нанести контр-удар, даже если вы находитесь у него за спиной) Не нормально развитая система сайдстепов, где вы также можете получить удар от противника, который должен был промахнуться по вам, но увы, противник ударив по тому же воздуху может попасть по вам.   Но несмотря на все это banco выпустит коллаборацию с nike и сделает лимитированные часы вместо хороших патчей, поздравляю, это худший файтинг в истории. Единственное, что в нем хорошо - это графика.

This patch is a complete disaster that destroys the very essence of the game.  A chaotic gameplay experience The developers have completely shattered the game’s balance by making offense far too powerful. The game has turned into a mindless rushdown fest where defense, once a core pillar of the series, has become unnecessarily difficult. Reacting now requires an absurd mix of inhuman reflexes, encyclopedic knowledge, and lightning-fast analysis. Even worse, the game has become a never-ending lottery, a simple rock-paper-scissors match where luck outweighs technical skill. Every interaction feels like a gamble, making the experience frustrating and unbearable.  A disastrous development direction The decision to bring in SoulCalibur developers was a fatal mistake. Tekken is not SoulCalibur, and trying to force mechanics from a completely different game into Tekken’s system betrays the very DNA of the franchise. Harada and his team seem to have lost sight of what made Tekken a true fighting game masterpiece.  An outrageous price tag As if things weren’t bad enough, Bandai Namco is charging €40 for this mess! This price is absolutely ridiculous for a patch that turns Tekken into a game of pure luck. At this rate, I’d rather spend my money at the slot machines at the carnival—at least there, I know I’m gambling from the start.  An ultimatum for Tekken If this patch isn’t fixed soon, I’m done with Tekken. This is no longer the game I’ve known and loved for three decades. In its current state, it’s unplayable and no longer worth my time.  Bandai Namco, fix this before it’s too late!"

DLC characters were fine because I was only going to play one or two characters so I didn't really mind not owning each character. But there is a big problem, you can't use the DLC characters in training, and you are unable to view the replays of a match against a DLC character (if you don't own the character). You legitimately have to PAY to learn the matchups against these characters, which is honestly disgusting. I don't really care about the tekken coins stuff because all you can do is buy cosmetics with them, so that doesn't really bother me, but it is really scummy to add ""V-Bucks"" to a $90 CDN game a few months after launch. The game is flawed with a really fun gameplay loop but ruined by terrible monetization choices."

It was weird when the characters talk each other in different languages. How do they understand each other in different languages? The arcade story was fine. The character stories was fine, it just beat 5 opponents to get a cinematic cutscenes. Some of few characters do have a funny cinematic cutscenes. The gameplay is great. I do like the combat system in this game. The combat animations were fast and smooth, making every fight feel incredibly dynamic. It's different from Tekken 7 like the heat system wasn't in older Tekken games. The graphics and the character models were stunning. The music in this game was so good and banger.

I am a Tekken veteran and I can assure you: This game is close to Guilty Gear Strive than Tekken 7/6 etc.  With the new S2 patch now every character got buffed, from an already to bloated and crazy standard. Basically everyone upgraded from a machine gun to a tactical nuke. The game is and will be so pressure and 50/50 focused, that you won't have fun as a defender.  Legacy stuff, like ki-charge and manual teching (backroll tech) have been removed, completely altering the gameplay and simplefying it.  As a through-and-through Tekken fan:  THIS GAME WILL MAKE ME DROP IT IN THE NEXT 7 DAYS! I urge every Tekken fan to give a negative review and minimize gameplay in order to give them a heavy hit, otherwise things won't change.  I hope I can prevent any old Tekken Fan from buying this game. It isn't worth it; at most as a casual and even then you won't have fun being stomped by your opponents.  Do better Team Tekken!"

173335493,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8, while undeniably more accessible than its predecessors, has stripped away much of the tactical depth that defined the series. The game feels like it's been simplified to cater to a larger player base, but at the cost of what made Tekken unique. What we're left with is a game that's largely about 50/50 situations, with little room for the nuanced, defensive play that even 2D fighting games manage to preserve.  One of the biggest disappointments for me is how defense is not only unrewarded but outright punished, particularly with the introduction of chip damage. In other fighting games, there are defensive tools to counterbalance aggressive play, but in Tekken 8, it feels like the game is designed to reward the player who can memorize the best combos and apply pressure non-stop. The Ranked matches exacerbate this issue, becoming a toxic experience where opponents either quit after one match, have unbearable lag, or exhibit other frustrating behaviors.  After over 100 hours of trying to give this game a chance, I've lost the drive to continue. I might revisit it if Kunimitsu is reintroduced, but for now, Tekken 8 is getting uninstalled. I'm finding more satisfaction in games like Guilty Gear Strive or Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, where my efforts in practicing hit confirms are actually rewarded, unlike in Tekken 8, where any attempt at analysis seems to get me punished anyway.  The final straw for me is the Battle Pass system, which feels even more intrusive and unpleasant in Tekken 8 than in Rising. It's a feature I genuinely dislike and it only adds to my overall disappointment with the game."
157756742,english,1,1778820,"[b]Tekken 8, the latest installment in the iconic fighting game franchise developed by Bandai Namco, continues to redefine the genre with its polished gameplay, stunning visuals, and diverse roster of characters. I am going to go into detail about this:[/b] [list] [*][b]Stunning Visuals and Immersive Environments:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 screams breathtaking graphics and brilliantly designed environments that put players in dynamic and vibrant battle arenas. From bustling city streets to serene natural landscapes and from there to Nightmare realities, each stage is a visual spectacle, enhancing the overall gaming experience.[/i]  [*][b]Refined Gameplay Mechanics:[/b] [i]Building upon its previous installments, Tekken 8 introduces refined gameplay mechanics that offer a perfect balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for Tekken Pros. The controls are responsive and creative, allowing players to execute complex combos and special moves with precision. I can also add executing combos that are just frames, are much more easily executable now.[/i]  [*][b]Diverse Roster of Characters:[/b] [i]With a diverse roster of characters, each with their own unique fighting style and backstory, Tekken 8 offers something for every player. From classic favorites like Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama to newcomers with innovative fighting techniques like Azucena and Victor, the character selection is vast and varied, and rumored to be becoming bigger and bigger in the coming years.[/i]  [*][b]Engaging Story Mode:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 features an engaging story mode that delves deeper into the rich lore of the Tekken universe. Players embark on a thrilling journey filled with intrigue, betrayal, and epic showdowns, unraveling the mysteries behind each character's motives, with the main story just based on the Mishima Bloodline.[/i]  [*][b]Robust Online Multiplayer:[/b] [i]The online multiplayer feature of Tekken 8 delivers an exhilarating experience, allowing players to test their skills against opponents from around the world. With robust matchmaking features and various online modes, including ranked matches and tournaments, the competitive scene is vibrant and engaging, the net-code is not perfect but its way better than the Tekken 7 when it came out back in the days. [/i]   [*][b]Customization Options:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 offers extensive customization options, allowing players to personalize their favorite characters with unique costumes, accessories, and cosmetic items. Also paying homage to other characters from the games like Resident Evil with adding their customized costumes in the game. From traditional martial arts attire to outlandish outfits, the customization options are virtually limitless, adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, so that my character may look cool while Kicking A$$.[/i] [/list]  [b][i]In the end I would like to add that Tekken 8 surpasses expectations as a fighting game masterpiece, combining stunning visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, with new Game Modes and a diverse cast of characters to deliver an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or new to the franchise, Tekken 8 offers something for everyone and cements its place as one of the finest fighting games of all time. I would recommend highly to anyone and to anybody who is into fighting games or not, as this will hook them up.[/i][/b]"
168485587,english,0,1778820,"I am going to refund this game. I payed for Ultimate Edition, thinking I will obviously have access to everything the game have to offer right? WRONG! There's still lots of customization that are locked behind, sit down for this one, in-game real money purchases!

169651406,english,0,1778820,"There will be always be 50/50s in fighting games, but the keyword here is 'forced'—forced by the universal mechanic, not by the unique characters or player agency over them. When you factor in those heat interactions over all the sets, it becomes a core mechanic that decides the outcome of the match. It's as if it 'fills the entire game,' like an anchor point, and the characters' unique styles and stances take a back seat. The matches are way too fast and aggresive for any deliberate play.  Bottom line is, I hate the heat mechanic itself and want it gone. Heat engagers break momentum (like those long goddamn rage arts were not enough), push the other player to the wall, and force you to guess. Yes, it gives you a chance to redeem a mistake, but it's like the game is forcing me to play a certain way that I never asked for. I also have to use my heat, be aggressive, and win that one interaction or avoid losing to it, or the other player will force me to the wall. This was not the case in T7, as you could only do that with good reads and combo execution, not absurd pushbacks. T7 was also very good in terms of balance in season 5. Yes devs are 'fixing' the game but the game itself is the problem. They just want the fights to look good on streams and tournaments; hence heat, but they killed defense now there's no  turtle syle , baiting etc you just cant do it and there's no incentives its just mash mash heat engager  heat smash  forward momentum mash mash. I play when I can but I don't enjoy it as much as tekken 7, strangely it doesnt even feel good to win as its more mentally draining than fun imo. Maybe that just me idk."

176364038,english,0,1778820,"Probably the easiest and most aggressive entry in the series, Tekken 8 has solid features but is marred by scummy monetization policies. It feels like I'm playing a free-to-play, gacha game anytime there is a new update. Miss the latest DLC character? The main menu will remind you constantly of their presence, with the in-game store taking priority over the ""real"" menu, forcing you to navigate around it. This is unfortunate in a cheaper game, but understandable. It's unforgivable when the base cost is 70 USD, and another 40 for a ""character pass"" that includes 4 characters and nothing else.   More concerning is the way Bandai Namco handled this. The Tekken Team has always said one thing and done another regarding these policies. Murray and Harada were on record saying there would be no in-game store, battle pass, or loot boxes. But without fail, all of these things have come to pass. The only caveat is potentially the loot boxes -- the asset is currently being used to advertise bundled costume packages -- but give it time. Recently, Heihachi's stage was sold separately from his DLC -- a departure from Tekken 7's season pass, and the community has been up-in-arms over this. But I feel the Heihachi stage drama is  just a figurehead for a larger discontent that the community feels over constantly being asked to pay more and more for things that used to be free.   The game needs a change in direction ala No Man's Sky at this point to right the ship. There's too much negativity surrounding it, and Bandai Namco need to re-establish good will with their players. That's the only apology worth anything."
191694070,english,0,1778820,"Ill start off by saying i love Tekken and i don't want to see it fail. That being said if you are someone who, like me wanted to pick up Tekken because you saw the intricate movement, whiff punishment and defensive prowess of JDCR and you wanted to work towards that level then i have bad news for you. That is not this game. Tekken 8 went in a different direction, once you get past all the knowledge checks what you are left with in this game is an overabundance of canned mixups, oppressive frames and in general very few options to move around in 3 dimensions or play defensively. This isn't coming from a jaded legacy player either, my first Tekken was Tekken 7 and i have to say Tekken 8 has mostly moved away from what made me fall in love with it in the first place.  TLDR: I don't think this game is worth taking seriously as a competitive game. If you just wanna play it for shits casually it will probably be fun."
185237105,english,0,1778820,"Gameplay wise, it's nothing compared to previous Tekken games, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's designed to be more accessible, which is good, but the price for casual interest is very high. It's just a completely different game—one that rewards mindless offense and punishes defensive play styles, forcing players to just run at each other all the time.  If you're to play this game, understand that you'll get tons of games where you'll lose 70+% of your HP not because you played poorly, but simply because you guessed incorrectly. If someone with 5 hours can luck into a win against a higher-ranked player simply because that player guessed incorrectly, then we have a problem. Also understand that this version of Tekken is no longer a martial arts fighting game—expect to see and fight against guns, laser beams, dragons, Ifrit, and a lot more anime-looking stuff. If you just want down-to-earth martial arts, then maybe just wait for the new VF game 🤷🏽.  And oh, I'm not even gonna talk about the whole DLC mess (releasing the shop months after release to avoid bad reviews, putting legacy characters (and a stage) behind a paywall, etc. There's already a lot of reviews about that, here and on other platforms."
191850184,english,0,1778820,"As a player with over 3500 hours in Tekken 7 I was very excited to see what the next entry in the series would be. My review is being written as of Day 3 of Season 2.  [h2] Network and PC performance [/h2] When the game released on PC it still had performance and network issues that were reported in the network test. As a user with a custom build machine that is tuned well and can play all the latest games on highest settings Tekken 8 still has performance issues at times. Every time I am on the character select screen the game will become slightly choppy when swapping and selecting characters. The game can sometimes crash on PC. Users that played Tekken 7 on PC will remember if you would alt tab there was a chance the game would crash. This is still on ongoing issue with Tekken 8.  Regarding net code issues, it still feels like Tekken 7 season 4. I am not a developer so I do not know what can be done to improve the net code but it is sad to see a fighting game release in the year that it did (2024) and have such poor net code when other titles like street fighter 6 and guilty gear strive have phenomenal roll back net code.   [h2] Presentation + content [/h2] The costume redesigns the characters received are a warm welcome and do a lot for the returning cast. The music and stages in the game are brilliant. Tekken 8 honestly has one of my favourite soundtracks in the series. I was really looking forward to the story mode as I was invested in seeing what happened after the ending of Tekken 7. The story mode was brilliant and is easily my favourite one iv played in a fighting game. Hopefully we can see a big follow up during a DLC release for Tekken 8.  Customisation is cool and I hope it continues to see free updates over time. The jukebox features is something I always wanted for PC users so it's nice to see us finally get it after missing out on it being a PS4 exclusive for Tekken 7.  I do wish there was more game modes available to play. For example having Team battle come back from the older entries would be really fun for offline play with friends or online in private lobbies.  [h2] Gameplay [/h2] This entry is very rewarding for aggressive play. The new heat system promotes players to stay on the offensive rather than  using movement and blocking to counter play their opponent.  With the new chip system you are punished for blocking and trying to play slowly to get into a better position. This is a huge change in the direction from the previous entry (Tekken 7) where you could use that games movement system to block and take your time to get out of situations. Since Tekken Tag tournament 1 (1999) players have been using movement (Korean back dash cancelling + sidestepping) to avoid these guessing situations and create whiff opportunities however with Tekken 8 having nerfed movement  (With season 2 they have buffed side steps which is nice but back dash cancelling still feels horrible) you will find yourself at times being forced to guess on a 50/50.  I think some of the hit effects are too much. When Clive activates heat and starts doing through his moves it really takes away from the fight and is too distracting.   Every member of the roster got some new tools coming into Tekken 8.  Characters have new single hit and combo strings to change how their game play looks and feels. Some users may find characters play vastly different than their previous entries (Jack-8) is a great example of this.  I think it is important that characters feel unique and have clear defined strengths and weaknesses. I am unsure what approach the developer team are taking with Tekken 8. But it feels to me that characters are starting to feel similar and lose their identity which is a first for a series that has so many unique and interesting characters. Take King for example. Does he need to have the best counter hit string in the game (DF+2,1) which you can hit confirm for a full combo? This does not make sense to me. As a wrestler type character he should be more focused on doing big single hits and using his cool chain throws.   There are currently 14 characters in the game with the guard break mechanic (Bryan, Clive, Devil Jin, Feng, Heihachi, jack, Kuma, Lidia, Panda, Paul, Reina, Shaheen, Steve, Yoshimitsu) which will break through your block and guarantee a follow up vs you.  In Tekkn 7 only two characters had this functionality (Lidia and Fahkumram) with Bryan also has a unique version of this mechanic since Tekken 3 (Taunt). Seeing it become such a normal part of the game really has made it no longer feel special.   With the latest update to the game (Season 2) we were expecting the developers to tone down how aggressive the game is and show us what defensive options they were working on. Since the latest patch characters across the board have become even stronger and more oppressive. More characters have access to 100+ dmg combos without rage and new tools to force you to block and guess on a 50/50 as you cannot use movement to escape situations. Chip damage is still a massive issue and heat lasts for too long when activated.  There are also currently some game breaking bugs from characters such as jack and Paul that have new moves that seem to have slipped past testing and are causing interactions that were not intended. It being only day 3 of season 2 more bugs could be found in the coming days/weeks. Hopefully we get an emergency patch to fix them.  [h2] Closing thoughts [/h2]  I am not sure what the future holds for the game.    I feel like Bandai Namco have been developing Tekken 8 to be enjoyable for the user on the attack without thinking how does it feel to be the user on the defending side.  Just because being on the offensive feels good doesn't mean being on the defending side has to feel bad. But with the core systems in place for Tekken 8 that is exactly how the game feels. From speaking with casual and pro players it does not seem that either group is happy with the direction the game is going.   I think the developers have lost sight of what made Tekken so much fun. It wasn't big flashy hit effects, over powered moves, characters having no defined weaknesses.  [list] [*] It was the unique characters and their specifics strengths. [*] It was seeing someone put years into a character and mastering what their specific game plan was and aspiring to be that great. [*] It was being a new player and seeing a clip of someone moving around the screen fast thinking ""Wow how are they moving like that??"". [*] It was the people who took the time out of their day to host online and offline events just for people to show up and play their favourite fighting game. [*] It was seeing people coming together from different countries to compete and change their lives [/list]  [b] It was the community.[/b]  And right now it feels like the developers are no longer listening to the community.  You can do as many collaborations and have as many guest characters as you want. If no one is around to play the game who will purchase the future dlcs you make?  I am lucky enough that I have a healthy offline scene of cool people who play for fun and want to improve. I hope the developers can open up a bit more with the community and maybe reach out for more feedback on future patches or ideas they have.  Everybody who purchased Tekken 8 loves the series. We just want to see it go in a different direction than the current one.  All the best   o/"

UDATE#2: Added Note as of 6/4/24:   BATTLE PASS ROUND 1 has ended and literally nothing replaced it. Menus are missing or empty. I did not buy it and frankly don't care- But I want people scoping these reviews to see that in a $70 game, Namco is late on a seamless Battle Pass for this ""Live Service"" Game.   Absolutely hilarious.   The hits keeps coming!  UPDATE #3 7/21/2024: They did it- Namco really did.   They added in-game advertisements to a stage for NIKE shoes... Namco just spent an HOUR at a panel discussing Nike Foamposite Tekken shoes and the BOX they come in... at EVO?! WTF!  Nike is historically known for Sweatshops and ruining communities in 3rd world countries. Why put this in the game? GREED STRIKES AGAIN!  Chipotle too!?   You know, the restaurant chain that is mainly in the US? Yeah- You can earn in-game content by beating King in the battle lounge starting 7/23. This game and all of the additions to it are not for the community or for the playerbase- It seems to be all for Ads, selling stuff that has little to do with the playerbase and is prioritized to make money for Namco.   I already paid $70. So did you (or even more).   Please don't support this. If you love Tekken- don't take this lying down. It will continue to get worse as Namco uses these scummy and dishonest tactics to squeeze as much money and profit as possible... Namco is using these moments to test what they can get away with.

Players expected the stage to be included. It was never announced i would be paid content. Lidia's stage was free...   LOL Original Post (because it continues to evolve)  I am sad about the MTXs and the lazy, absolutely disgusting reused assets from Tekken 7 filling their introductory Battle Pass. These items were held back from launch on purpose just to be dumped in this battle pass. If they are not from Tekken 7- take a look at Tekken Tag 2... Again, reused assets.  These scummy MTXs and Battle Pass were purposefully not discussed before launch and was added 2 months after launch- to sidestep reviews and negative reports. Don't let NAMCO ignore us or move on from this.  This is not Tekken.  This is an example of creating a problem purposefully and selling the solution.   DLC characters if not purchased cannot be labbed against in 10 second drop-in battle replays- a  feature advertised and promoted before launch and in the base-game before MTXs and DLC  were announced or released. Why?    Why is an UNREAL and Blender BALL asset (you can't even defend this Namco) being an item on the battle pass? This has got to be one of the scummiest and laziest battle passes I have ever seen in a game period- And it was  $70 on top of that. NAMCO should be ashamed! To put it in perspective- this ball can be added into UE by making 4-6 clicks.  I know why...

Truly disgusting behavior, and something many people seemed okay with, which wasn't surprising given how soft the gaming community has become regarding this type of stuff. I asked Valve to refund my purchase, because this was not something I wanted to support, and I was denied due to [i]""more than 2 hours played and 14 days passed since purchase.""[/i] Let's just ignore the publisher knowingly misleading their players, and changing the [i]ESRB[/i] rating later to include those succulent words we all crave to hear, [i]""In-game purchases.""[/i]  But [i]Bandai[/i] is a double G—[b]greedy[/b] and [b]glutenous[/b].

To pass the time until it fully came, [b]I played the demo, loving every second of my 23 hours spent with it.[/b] Sure, its content offering was small: only 4 (out of 32) playable characters, the first battle of the story mode, the intro section of the Arcade Quest mode, and a few Super Ghosts fights that let me reach only the [i]Warrior[/i] rank. But it's the motion of the ocean that counts! And, oh boy, [b]did it rock my boat![/b] The 26th just couldn't come soon enough.  The gameplay shocked me by how easily I jelled with it. Fast, flashy, and furious, yet it was welcoming to a complete noob like myself. I was loving the learning process, and it didn't feel overwhelming. I even managed to get gud at doing some simple combos and air juggling, so that's nice. And I love the new gameplay addition—the [b]Heat[/b] system. Being able to stop my opponent's attack flow by using the [b]Heat Burst[/b] attack, which is uninterruptible, is music to my ears. Sure, you can easily block it, but this is where the fun begins—[b]trying to time it, [i]just right![/i][/b] Plus, the [b]Heat Engager[/b] and [b]Heat Smash[/b] [i](I do be engaging in smashing)[/i] attacks can be used to extend combos and deal even more damage in the process. Simply majestic. The trade-off is that [b]Heat[/b] only lasts 15 seconds. But do you really need more than that? Sometimes less is more, you know.  Speaking of cool attacks, [b]Rage Art[/b] is present once again. This is essentially a super funky high-damage special move you can only do when your health is low. I can't count the number of times using it saved my noob behind from dying. And I gotta say, they are always a treat to watch. [b]This superbly animated sequence, combined with the game's insane visuals, sparks joy each and every time I watch one play out.[/b]  And all the fighting is [i]extra[/i] spiced up by the crazy amount of special effects on the screen each punch, kick, grab, or flying leg kick thrown produces. I can't explain why, but I love the sight of them. [b]It makes watching the punch land that much more oh-so-satisfying.[/b] The animations are also fantastic, further adding to the amazing feel of the combat.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260998 The visuals are simply insane. [i][b]Unreal Engine 5[/b][/i] shines, and so do daddy Kazuya's massive [i]pecs[/i]! Everything, from the arenas, some with multiple rooms you can blast your opponent into, to the character design, is superb and extremely rich in detail. Just amazing stuff. But there's one complaint from me—[b]Paul lost his iconic hair and looks like a Karen[/b] (why [i]Bamco?[/i]).   Also, if you enjoy character customization as much as I do (a lot), then the Arcade Quest mode will be your wet dream. Here, all bets are off, and we'll get free reign over how our fighters look. Will they look wacky? Yes. Creepy? Also yes. Lewd? [b]Hopefully.[/b] Giving players more customization options and freedom is always a plus in my book!  Lastly, the over-the-topness of the story seems to be intact.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260668 I can't wait to see what one of gaming's most dysfunctional families, the Mishimas, is up to. Likely a lot of half-naked men fighting each other, preferably near a cliff, volcano, or maybe a cliff overlooking a volcano. We shall see.  Simply put, [b]it's all (gonna be) perfect![/b]  And after having written 99 reviews, my 100th review will be the first and last [i]improper[/i] one. But [i]Tekken 8[/i] deserved this sacrifice, as it reignited my passion for gaming when no other game could.  So, thank you, [i]Tekken 8.[/i] Thank you to all the developers who poured their hearts and souls into this game. Lastly, thanks to all of you, top bananas, for coming to my [b]TEK[/b]talk. I hope you all enjoy [i]Tekken 8[/i] as much as I am.

168337995,english,0,1778820,"Despite all the 5 balance patches, the game is a complete mess. Granted it is better than it was at launch, but the amount of busted op moves is still insane. So few characters have well defined strengths and weakness. Its just a case of find your 3 op moves on that character, spam the crap out of them. Defence does not matter anymore, side stepping is so weak, so many moves have insane plus frames and give 100% follow ups. I loved t7, and was so excited for t8 but this game isnt fun. I can count the amount of good enjoyable fights on one hand. In 88 hours, thats a joke."

While my main characters were Nina and Hwoarang in the previous games, I made the decision to switch to Jin, and he is undeniably cool, especially with the wing effect in his design. I'm playing on my trusty 6-year-old laptop equipped with a GTX 1070. Not only does it run smoothly at 60 fps on medium settings, but the graphics also look absolutely awesome.  The online experience is flawless; I can't recall encountering any laggy games, and there are a lot of offline modes for you to enjoy, with Ghost Battle being a personal favorite.  I absolutely recommend this game; it promises an abundance of entertainment.  _____ >> Update: I nominated Tekken 8 for the categories below for Steam Award 2024:  > ""Best Game on Steam Deck Award"" (although, I don't have Steam Deck)  > ""Best Game You Suck At Award"" (yup, true!)  > ""Sit Back and Relax Award"" :)"

Not only it respects it's audience, It's also an improvement over it's predecessor in every single way and stands alongside 3 as the best game in the series.   Not enough people praising how a game that looks this good is running this well as well. I don't think I've seen many games look as stylish and as beautiful as this game does. The movements and combos are meaty, the sounds are punchy and give feedback, a real technical marvel.  I only wished there were more unlockables like the old school entries, it would feel much better unlocking the characters as you finish stuff as it also would give you an incentive to play more on the down times and to give more meaning to complete other modes. The online functionality is working perfectly, had absolutely no problems playing against strangers and friends alike, except for getting my butt kicked, but that's a granted.

192049829,english,0,1778820,"💀 1,100+ hours to end up with season 2. I've played this game almost every day since release. I loved Tekken 8. It wasn’t perfect, but it felt like high speed chess especially for someone new to fighting games. Now? It's overly aggressive, and most matches feel like coin flips thanks to constant 50/50s.  -Damage is completely out of control  -Pressure is nonstop. Defense gets punished harder than offense  -Some characters straight up feel like final bosses  -It’s so offense heavy I feel like I lose just for trying to KBD  Until they fix the balance and bring back some defense, I’m tapping out of ranked. Maybe even the game entirely. This was my favorite game. :(  (Yes, I'm writing this after an unholy loss streak. Let me cope.)"
165228643,english,0,1778820,"Disappointing is an understatement when it comes to Tekken 8.   This game I will admit I was hyped. Seeing the game play and all the crazy stuff they added looked interesting. Oh boy I was wrong. This game is just a party game that gives anyone a chance to win. You could outplay someone 9-1 but you have to remember the opponent has that 1 and they destroy you because they press their special win button (heat). Heat is a pretty big problem, the single player mechanic it gives isn't fun. I hope they balance heat out but we will see in the future.   I've played ranked for at least 150 hrs getting to the top ranks and I can tell you that ranked and the online play is flawed in many ways. The ranking system is really bad, if you get demoted you have a chance to get that rank back again. It isn't like Tekken 7 when you get demoted you get sent all the way back. But I think this is more for the casual gamer so they don't get demoralised which I understand but why allow it for high ranks? Don't get me started with the plugging (rage quitting) that comes with this game. 7/10 matches you will get a rage quit because the bans are manual from their end. The ban system is really whack, I could hop on like Fariborz or LawofEngland with my macros and not get punished for it. Even if I get banned I can use family share to hop onto another account.   Tekken shop is a disaster, I love getting costumes that modders themselves put into the game for free. The devs had the audacity to screw them over by DMCAing them all so they had to take their mods down. Also the devs have made it super clear they really want to focus on the Tekken shop for obvious reasons because it is their second hand income.   I will change this review when things get fixed and that but I don't suggest at the current state of the game to get it. I will say get it on a sale or wait for patches that fix the problems.   Update Season 2: Soul Calibur 6 devs ruined the game by adding 50/50 which makes the game 2 touch, there is still no skill in the game. Anyone can literally win against a solid player because not everyone is perfect with defence. It is a shame that the game is getting tarnished like this, the copium is gone. o7  Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
166573886,english,0,1778820,"After putting a good amount of hours into the game and reaching High purple/Low blue ranks, I can honestly say that this is the least amount of fun I've ever had with a Tekken game. The amount of catering to new players and spamming playstyles makes the game feel like a coinflip. The introduction of armored powercrush moves, the heat system as a whole, and the return of rage arts makes the game feel like garbage. Movement/sidestepping doesn't feel as rewarding when the opponent can just mash 2+3 and catch you regardless of positioning. The roster is great....the only problem is that you don't see 80% of it in online matches because King/Dragonov/Victor/Reina exist.  For $80 I could have gifted all of my friends a coinflip simulator instead and had about the same amount of fun.  Every match feels the exact same. Apply pressure>Opponent activates heat>Negative frames>Opponent 50/50's>Block for neutral frames>Opponent Powercrushes>Hard knockdown>Wakeup>Block>Take 30% of healthbar from chip damage>Punish>Combo>Opponent Rage Art/Heat Burst>Round lost. Literally every game.   More floor/wall breaks, untechable grabs in certain situations, Dragonov, Losing health on certain inputs that are 100% necessary for relevant combo damage, Dragonov, GOD AWFUL TRACKING/MOVEMENT, No penalty/reward when an opponent ""plugs"", Dragonov, extremely poor matchmaking balance, poor character balance, fan service, the list goes on.  I had high hopes for Tekken 8, but honestly I'm just disappointed. Will likely stick to 2D fighters where things work as intended and make sense.  60% win rate and still deranking. GG Harada.  MONETIZATION IS NOT THE ISSUE."
159573686,english,0,1778820,"Anyone remember back when in Tag 2 Harada said it was wrong to release characters as paid DLC in a fighting game? Then he backtracked on Tekken 7, where the total DLCs cost more than the base game. Then he went even further beyond in Tekken 8 and nerf the customization items, so you have to pay to get more clothing options. What is going to get nerfed in Tekken 9 next? Paying for song choices?  I paid for the ultimate edition just to support this franchise, despite the sh*tty golden clothing no one ever wears... but had I known this in-app purchases would become a thing for Tekken 8. I honestly wouldn't have bothered.  Guess I will learn my lesson for the next Tekken.  EDIT: THE NIBBARINOS AT BAMCO ADDED BATTLE PASS? AYO WTF?!"

178123323,english,0,1778820,"Edit: 4/1/2025  The Devs just released the worst balance patch they probably ever could have for this game. They doubled down on the features that the entire community disliked and told us that this was a patch that would give us more defensive options. By defensive options they meant here are more plus frame moves to force your opponent to block and guess and you need to out mash your opponent for optimal gameplay.  The developers at this point obviously think the community is a bunch of kids who dont know what they want and they absolutely know best so we should just all take it.  Screw that this game sucks ass, do not buy it for Season 2 till they make significant changes.  Original Review: Balance aside, the game launched and then an updated added an in game store revealing why we were missing cosmetics from Tekken 7. Then the battle pass came, and now whenever you login you get 20 notifications saying you got x item or check out the battle pass.  It feels very scummy and they didnt allow season pass owners to get a stage with Heihachi. They are just trying to suck the money out of the playerbase."

159548573,english,0,1778820,"This game is in a very though position to talk about for me. The design behind Tekken 8 forces you to forget almost everything you already know from Tekken, in a fundamental perspective. Characters have lost their identity in general because of game design itself. Most of the cast have a very powerful 50/50, momentun is not a thing since the game greatly benefits you for mashing. The more you mash, the farther you can climb, theres no other way to say this. There is just way too many powerful strings that will make you eat one 50/50 after another. Completely removing one way to play and forcing another feels wrong and I can't understand this game, it's just casino simulator. I've been playing Tekken for almost 10 years and this just feels like something else and I cannot say what it is.  Rank system is garbage and frustrating. It's just not fair to be going with like 7 to 9 win streak in a higher rank (talking about bushin, tekken king, kishin and so on) and only be getting 100 to 200 points maximum per match, and when you lose ONE match (not the ft2, just one match) you lose 1.500 points in just o n e match, even if it is one rank higher. This is just unfair. It would make sense in a lose streak, not in a win streak.  Characters have no real weaknesess, power crush mid that is also heat engager AND safe is stupid. There is a lot wrong with this game and I don't feel like it will be getting fixed anytime soon, I do actually belive that it will become worse if the standard balancing keep going in the casino direction (Eddy).  If you are not playing offense offense offense in this game, you are just dead. Even if you have good defense, the punish you usually get from reading your opponents is not a big of deal most of the time (you can tell by the rage art not being universally launch punishable). Theres soooo many bad decisions in this game that I can't see myself playing much more of this. It's tiring, not fun and stressful.  I think I don't even need to say anything about microtransactions coming out of nowhere, a BUNCH of them added in just a few days. Tekken Shop and Battle Pass??? Battle pass is just greedy since it's just a bunch of items from Tekken 7 and retextures. They didn't even put some efforts in hiding it.  In a much more casual level, this game is amazing, looks awesome and feels very good to play, but thats about it."
160056517,english,1,1778820,"One line review: Tekken8 is amazing.  Slightly expanded review: Probably the biggest leap in quality since Tekken2->3, 8 refines the mechanics from T7, adds modern controls a la SF6, hugely improves the graphics and sound, adds cross play and PvP rematches and makes the game much more accessible to boot. It also adds a real money shop, which, well, is not popular, but is also entirely ignorable.  The sound in particular is great - a blocked quick jab might sound a bit mid, but most hits sound like a damn gunshot and add a heck of a lot to the atmosphere.  The cast of characters is also diverse and fascinating, from giant hugely hard hitting war robots to a hyperfast peruvean coffee-saleswoman who likes nothing more than doging your attacks to hit you from the back, literal devils and demons, a chavvy kind of boxer, a hotheaded taekwando expert, happy shopper bruce lee, a giant championship wrestler who think he's a cat, two kinds of bear, knock-off magic Blade, a gun-toting cyro-frozen irish assassin, a french spymaster who thinks karambit knives are somehow acceptable in a fist fight, a space alien octopus robin hood ninja thing, an egyptian lady who has the literal god of war stuck in her hand somehow and a good two dozen more. More will come with DLC, ofc, but there are plenty to choose from and lots to experiment with.  The really great thing about tekken is that it has an almost abyssal level of depth, with so many mechanics, both new and old. Now this might seem like it would make the game hard to learn, especially if you're new to the series, but it's also really intuitive. You have four buttons, left and right kicks, and left and right punches. That's it! If you want to do a quick right left combo, you press right punch, then left punch. Easy.  If you have good timing, are patient and understand distancing even a little bit, you really don't even need a tutorial, it's that welcoming.  Now, all the above is really only about the PvP mode(s). SP has always been a bit thin in tekken games, but fwiw, I think it's probably at it's best here; there's the campaign which to its credit has tried to mix things up a bit, character episodes which also focus on the non-mainstream characters a bit more, arcade and arcade quest mode and also ghost battles. I guess it's alright? Tekken ball makes a return from 3, which is great, but you can't play it online for no good reason I can think of (e: you can, im just a big dummy, see comments), but the SP definitely takes a back-seat to the PvP modes.  There's also a bunch of nice touches, like how you can play as Tekken3 Jin, how the characters have rivalries and neat fight intros with their nemeses, replays which have advice when you watch them, kazuya's tits are FINALLY splashed all over the main menu*, there is the customary Tekken silliness, weirdness and ott anime moves and also Heihachi Mishima, possibly literally the most terrible person in the world, and easily the worst parent ever has died**. And then reincarnated as his own illegitimate daughter who is, if anything, even more horrifying to fight against. And she also has the devil gene that is basically the reason for everyone fighting in the first place, because of course she does.  One of my most favourite things is hwoarang mirror matches, which usually devolve into showing off, doing the flashiest moves you can and then get to the point where you are just improvising and re-interpreting each others combos in a sort of synchronised dance-off. It's just amazing to be a part of.  Edit: ok im going to write a bunch more about hwoarang and how his depiction in this game is just amazing. See taekwando, as a practiced olympic/ competitive sport, is quite a lot different than it was originally. Now, its about scoring points by, ideally, a spin kick to the head which counts for the most. So, in this game, hwo has a LOT of flashy high kicks which do a lot of damage, while smaller jabs and kicks serve to put the opponent in a place where high kicks count. It's kinda wonderful, really. Even better is that he had a tutor, Baek Doo San, who exemplifed the older more traditional style and now he has some of Baek's moves, rounding out his repertoire and showing he leant from his tutor.  *: Now you can choose which character you see  **: He's alive now, ofc  If you want an example of how silly it can get, here's Panda winning the tournament and then failing to deal with a chair: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dOp9YUJ_ow  I like it. I think it's great and i'm going to play some more right now. But I'm still terrible at it."

188007133,english,0,1778820,"While currently the overall reviews for this game are positive, most of the players that initially played and left their positive review are unfortunately gone.  The game is simply not fun to play at the state it's in. The character balancing is almost non existent in my opinion. The characters that were strong at the launch of the game are still strong a year later. They have pushed out balance changes during the year nerfing some of those characters, but it wasn't enough.  The 3D aspect of the 3D fighting game is more of a gimmick now than it ever has been. If you try to utilize the 3D aspect and sidestep, you can and most likely will at times get punished for trying seeing as a lot of moves track absurdly. The tracking should be heavily changed and nerfed, if you sidestep properly you should be rewarded, the opponent shouldn't just auto-realign to you during their strings. Some moves track right or left and you have to sidestep into the other direction. Some of those same moves track almost a full 180 (some track, but not that much), which leads to confusion as you will get hit when you're sidewalking and are almost behind the opponent.  With a lot of moves tracking where they shouldn't, if you add in absurd hitboxes you get the current condition of Tekken 8. Phantom hitboxes are a thing and I think that's fine as long as it's not too much. But if you add in the fact that when you sidewalked and are beside your opponent while he's doing his move. If you try to attack him before he's done you can and will get hit first yourself. By attacking you extend your hurtbox and for whatever reason there's a big chance you get hit first.

189798484,english,0,1778820,"This game Is hands down the worst Tekken ever made to date. First, the game is designed to be a button mashing fest where low level and high level gameplay look identical due to the extreme lack of depth in this game. Secondly, the monetization is so bad they re-release content from TEKKEN 7 and charge you for it in their battle pass. Thirdly, character move-sets have been homogenized to the point all characters essentially do the same thing. There are no longer interesting play styles and archetypes in this game. Finally, the story has to be one of the worst written, cringe inducing stories I have had the displeasure of playing. At first it was so bad it was good but now, with the inclusion of Heiachis story the story is an absolute joke. I am a huge Tekken fan and have never been particularly good at Tekken. I got to fujin as my highest rank in Tekken 7 and enjoyed every step of the way including the loses. There was always something to learn and something to improve at. There is always a point in all fighting games where they become 50/50 fiestas and if you enjoy that all power to you, but one thing is certain, this game is not Tekken anymore."
191785769,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 is a game where at ""Tekken King"" you will run into players who cannot break throws, panic rage art the frame they get it, mash at -23, and have no idea how to tech roll or get up from the ground. This was called ""Yellow Rank"" in Tekken 7 but ranked in this game is more akin to the Special Olympics."
176382192,english,0,1778820,"Once legendary fighting game series has lost its way.  It's now tainted with shady monetization practices, questionable ""casino"" gameplay mechanics, nonsensical character balancing and each dlc character is guaranteed to be so overpowered at launch... It's near pay to win.   I've been a fan since Tekken 1 and it's bizarre to see where the series has gone. The once focus on real life fighting styles is also gone and replaced with lasers, guns and other projectiles.  The ultimate edition does not include all dlc (even in the first season). Truly something that would make Ubisoft executives proud.  I hope Tekken team starts to focus more on the core gameplay and less on the atrocious  cosmetics.  Update after Season 2  Movement is pretty impressive now. Tekken team hinted for months about this S2 patch that would balance the game and make defense more feasible....however they have doubled down and made the ""casino"" gameplay even more extreme. The most viable strategy now is to rush down your opponent before they rush you. A pretty sad state of affairs could have been avoided if the devs made gradual small changes; instead of one huge patch with very significant changes, withheld from the community until the very launch.  I was excited to pre order the $100 version of the game when it first was announced. Since then there have been: a battle pass and an in game shop added just post launch Paid cosmetics and a paid stage not included in the $100 version of the game and the game now is so far from what Tekken is that it should probably be named something else.  In its current state Tekken 8 is similar to that time you were finished playing the witcher 3 and started watching the netflix adaptation expecting more good content.  After playing since Tekken 1 and being around in the arcade glory days, I guess this is where I get off.  I truly do hope that Harada and crew can get their act together and get this series back to its glory days...I will pass on S2 dlc until then."
191782728,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 is my first Tekken and I main Reina. I love her and this game to pieces. I've always understood why people preferred the defensive playstyle of previous Tekkens, but I enjoyed the aggressive focus of this game. I felt the aggressor should be rewarded for taking risks, not punished. Defence was now something IMPRESSIVE instead of just being a backdash magic 4 fest. You were still REWARDED for good defence despite it being harder.  I understand this game wants to focus on aggression and appealing to new players and I don't see the point of doing Tekken 7 again. But this is terrible guys. Terrible. You've turned most characters' rushdown into the most braindead, button mash fest it's ever been. Defence isn't hard anymore, it's IMPOSSIBLE. Everyone has good Mid/Low mixes regardless of if they deserved it or not. Character identity is being shot down in the street by removing execution and weaknesses. It is NOT FUN to play a character with NO EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS and NO WEAKNESSES. I am a new player who picked up a MISHIMA. Why do you think new players are some TikTok braindead idiots? And why are you trying to appeal to them when Tekken is famously difficult so they're not going to waste their time on it anyway? And why do your changes not even encourage TikTok braindead idiots to play because they, like everyone, are incapable of guessing correctly more than 50% of the time??? Are you guys just homogenising the cast because it's easier to balance? Why do we pay you then?  Not only is the balance of this patch in SHAMBLES because you removed so many character weaknesses so now they're just perfect. This patch is BUGGED too! Paul has an unintentional unblockable. There are numerous camera glitches resulting in unintentional wall splats. Steve qcf1 STILL randomly whiffs. On and on and on, and guaranteed there will be more the longer the patch is up. Not to mention all the new animations look TERRIBLE. Speeding up animations like Feng's qcf1 makes it look unnatural. Or Reina's d2, 1+2 just copy and pasting her 1+2. Pigeon Roll from Dragunov looks silly. Feng's b4, 2 doesn't match his fighting style at all or even look like a real attack. So you're telling me you spent 4 months on this patch not only for it to be unbalanced, but it also lacks ANY SENSE of quality control? What have you guys been doing all this time to not even test for BUGS?  Worst of all, it has been 24 hours since the patch dropped, and you guys haven't reverted the changes, temporarily taken down the servers or even SPOKEN to us. Not even assured us that you're on it and things will be okay. I still have faith you can fix this, but I'm losing faith that you can balance this game or that you care enough about the pros livelihood or what people sacrifice to try get good at this game. You're gonna do this again. Just like you've added hatchet kicks to characters who don't deserve it multiple times. Given characters tracking Hellsweeps multiple times. Given tracking plus on block moves to characters multiple times.   I don't know what you guys need to change to get it together, but change it and GET IT TOGETHER."

175362006,english,0,1778820,"Game's a 50/50 button masher by design. Players are 2 buttons away from dealing 80% of your life with Rage Art or Heat Smash. The Side-Step 3D element is ruined by half of the abilities homing. Blocking is a joke when you get slowed with negative frames or take massive chip damage. Everyone has an easy 50% damage launch combo that takes longer than a turn based RPG. Cheating is Rampant and unmanaged... I could go on and on.  If you are a button masher, or a self hating tryhard that is willing to study an impossible amount of frame data to tilt a 50/50 in your favor, you might enjoy this game. If you are sane and just want a simple game where you tussle and express skill, then I wouldn't call this a true fighting game."
176243761,english,0,1778820,"Despite the quality and polish this game is not worth the money, because how egregious the monetization is. This game does NOT cost 70 dollar. It costs a lot more.

Stages have gameplay impact meaning if you care about getting good you need to buy them and practice on them. Your wallet does impact your ability to improve in this game, and the game cost 70 dollar to start with.   Avoid this game for now. The devs doesn't respect you or your time."

Hardly any counterplay, complete homogenisation of pretty much the entire cast with strong mids and power lows, spike enders at the wall, homing attacks when we were going to ""buff sidesteps.""  Season 1 wasn't perfect, far from it, but we were getting used to it and counterplay was being discovered constantly. Whilst the homogenisation problem was still present, ever since T7 I'd argue, characters did indeed feel unique. Now everyone can be plus, have strong counter hits, hit the wall from any point on the stage, just do anything and everything.   In summary, this game doesn't feel like Tekken anymore. Genuinely a hollow shell of what could've been a great game. I'm out, 1.3 seconds."

163347987,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 has all the makings of a great game, but once again, Namco seems determined to fumble the ball when it counts most. We're just a couple of months into the game's life, and instead of tackling real issues, Namco seems set on sabotaging its own growth.  I can't recommend the game at it's current state. Devs are either overworked or completely incompetent. Every balance patch they break more things than they fix. Also they would rather change the core game system instead of target nerfing a single character, which results in even more unintended bugs and interactions in the game (broken wall combos, floors not breaking, etc.). They tried to nerf the obnoxious Azucena WR3,4 and it ended up being a buff because you can't even punish it on whiff.  Accidental buffs? Sound familiar? They did the exact same thing when they wanted to nerf Akumas techroll catch in Tekken 7. Instead of target nerfing the problematic interaction, they made a system-wide nerf to tech catches, which ended up taking away a layer of mindgame at the wall for every character. And the best part is, Akuma could still do the tech catch. They've done this many times before and they will do it again, because this is one of the most stubborn group of people that will blame the fanbase before they admit they did something wrong.  After a huge backlash on one balance patch, people demanded more transparency from the devs. So, what did we get? A brief burst of activity from the game directors on Twitter (which lasted about a month) and some half-hearted explanations buried in the patch notes. But they still sneak in changes without telling anyone. They made a huge change to the matchmaking system that resulted in people not finding any matches. I have been searching for a match, while writing this review and I found a single match with a player more than 5 ranks away from mine.  Bandai as a publisher is also not new to the anti-consumer practices. A $70 game is getting a ""battle-pass"" 2 months into it's release with filler, throwaway cosmetics that were available for free in the previous games.  One of the most knowledge check-heavy characters, Eddy, is a $6 DLC character, which you can't lab against if you don't buy him (can't even take over your own character in the replay).  I'm not the biggest modder but the modding scene is a huge part of the Tekken community. Instead of offering cosmetics that people would actually want to pay for, Namco decided to release laughable garbage and go after the modders just so they could squeeze out as much money as possible from their battlepass.  The balance is a mess (see Dragunov, Azucena etc.) but that could be remedied in the upcoming balance patches (lol).  Ranked is also full of pluggers. Instead of getting an automatic win when your opponent plugs, like in every other game, namco decided that its better to keep an excel spreadsheet of the players reported on twitter and manually issue bans to them every other patch... yeah.  Nobody's talking about this, but one of the main reasons I love tekken and not any other fighting game is because of the quality of character animations. All the moves felt like they had weight to them and looked very fluid. However, since the later Tekken 7 seasons (see Lidya's whole moveset, wallbounce) it has taken a huge dive. Some of the new animations in Tekken 8 are outright terrible (tornado animation, everybody getting a backflip move that make the character look weightless ex. Jin). This all culminated with Eddy that had his whole movelist reworked and now looks like he's sporadically jumping between animations when he does a move (no windup, no recovery, moves worse than an MK character). However, this is the least of the games problems. It looks gorgeous otherwise and devs did a great job. This is my favorite game franchise, which I've been playing since Tekken 3 on PS1 and I hate to see it in its current state, but the only way to get through to namco is to stop giving them more money. At the end of the day all they care about is money and this will keep happening if you keep supporting them with your wallets.  In short, Tekken 8 has potential, but until Bamco get their act together, I'd steer clear of this mess. I know this review will read like Im venting, because I am. Im sad to see this happen to my favorite franchise. There's a reason I have 3000 hours in Tekken 7 and just as many playing it offline with people I've met through this game that I can call my lifelong friends. UPDATE:  The upcoming patch seems to be promising. Obviously overtuned characters are getting nerfed and they seem to be providing a lot of free content for damage control. The game needs a few more of updates like these and it will be in a great state. I will update my review accordingly. UPDATE 2:  They were just weathering the storm. Now that people have quieted down, they release Genmaji Temple stage as a separate DLC, not included in season pass or ultimate edition. This company is a joke UPDATE 3: Clive happened. Update 4: Online is basically unplayable. The netcode is absolutely terrible. I dont think I can play another 8 years of this. Update 5: Season 2 is out. Game is balanced if everyone is a broken top 1. Devs are not listening. I would stay away"
191970507,english,0,1778820,"I've loved Tekken since playing T2 in arcades as a kid. I was never great, but enjoyed long sets with friends. Tekken 8 heat system was rough in Season 1 - it messed with character expression and turned matches into Heat spamming.  But Season 2 is a complete mess. It’s not Tekken anymore, just a button-mashing simulator with no depth.  New players might enjoy it, but veterans are better off waiting for changes or skipping it entirely."
162329251,english,0,1778820,"They Banned Iran ip for no reason!  I paid for this game and i can't even play it without VPN and of course its gonna effect on my ping and i'm receiving lots of hate comments from the community cz my ping is 130 ... that's not fair, i played this franchise since Tekken 2 released and now here I am, I cant play without VPN. thank you so much btw , the characters are not balance anymore and the game is not technical as it was before, you just need more luck!"
163598774,english,0,1778820,"PROS: The game is fun at a casual level and it is an improvement on Tekken 7 in terms of load times, graphics, and single-player content. The story is brief and entertaining and the new characters are unique and well-designed.  CONS: The dev team is convinced that making the game more aggressive and flashy (think eSports) is going to make newcomers and casuals more interested in the Tekken series. Personally, I'm not a fan of the gameplay changes. The new universal mechanic (heat) is basically a way to make the game more like advanced rock-paper-scissors and less about skill and game knowledge. I think that one of the cool things about Tekken is how much depth and skill expression there is to the game and heat is a lazy way to even the playing field. Aside from that, there are a lot of issues with the game that have yet to be resolved. There is still no anti-cheat of any kind. The netcode is quite bad for 2024 unless you're playing with a 4-5 bar wired connection. PC players that can't run the game at 60 fps force their opponents to play in slow motion (there is no minimum benchmark score needed to play online). The ranked system is a total mess and it is clear that the devs designed the ranked system to make it easy for new players to see their rank go up without actually getting better at the game. You can't lab pay to win DLC characters in replay mode unless you own them. They added an incredibly low-effort cosmetics store and battlepass system in a $70 game - you also can't buy anything directly, you have to buy 'Tekken coins' which means to get one $5 skin you'd have to pay $10 to have enough coins. Don't expect these problems to get fixed anytime soon. Overall, even though the game is fun, I would not recommend it. I think it's not worth getting into if there are other fighting games that seem equally appealing to you."
162059122,english,0,1778820,"Someone on the balancing team is a few sandwiches short of a picnic and it's really hurting the game.  I don't even feel it's a matter of ""prioritising casual players"" anymore, it feels like the patch was made by an AI language model trained only on satanic scriptures  I can look past the DLC/MTX scummery, suits are gonna be like that, but even the devs are nuts it turns out.. ahh..."
172467636,english,0,1778820,"This is a game that has simply hurt me too many times. I don't mind strong characters, I really don't. I could get my balls handed to me on a silver platter and still have fun, but that's just the thing. Sometimes, this stuff just ain't fun. Maybe it's just me but as a person who's been playing since Tekken 7, I'll just get to the point, I'm not going to say anything like, ""OH, old Tekken good new Tekken bad"", in fact i really enjoy the heat system and overall aggression. But it feels just, way too mashy? You get so minus to a point where sidestepping is literally not an option, and sidestepping itself is already really tricky to get the hang of yet very rewarding, sometimes however it simply feels impossible and you feel trapped and as a player it sucks. I play Paul, Jin, Kazuya, Leo, Dragonouv, and Devil jin, and I notice that I only do well once I start ""cheesing"" which might mean many things to many different people. So I'll be a bit more blunt and just say what my heart feels as of this moment, writing this review.   Neutral does not exist  At least that what it feels like to me, I don't see a point in doing a heat engager cancel in neutral when i'm gonna end up JUST AS MINUS if I had missed it anyways. Countless times I would think, ""Yes this is a safe distance, I will engage heat to utilize my resource advantage over the enemy. Only for them to just RA in response and magically magnetically gravitate towards me? Perhaps this is just a skill issue on my end but aside from that. Some times you feel extremely boxed in. Characters like King, Lidia, just sorta lock you in and once again, this might be a knowledge check, and I might just be bad but keep in mind I'm like the average purple rank. I have a Tekken King level friend that claims I am Kishin level, yet whenever I try to climb the ranks it just feels impossible? I swear I'd be on a 6 winstreak, lose once, and I'd be where I statred. Became a bit of an inside joke where we'd celeberate our ranks by going  ""Hey guys! I ranked from up from mighty ruler to mighty ruler!""  And I wish this was a joke but occasionally I would throw a demotion game, just so I can repromote and get that boost.   Ranking is messed up Footsies feel off There's no other game like tekken but sometimes it just hurts.  I'm open to any comments but I'm really just not in the mood for any git gud or tips. Too heartbroken for that.  I want to love Tekken but as I kept playing I realised that this is NOT healthy for me. I'd play Tekken with my friends and it'd always end in me going into a complain session. The worst part is that they'd just agree with me. All my complaints about random mid combo sideswaps, input eating, sidesteps turning into jumps and ducks, dropping combos because of wall jank. I wanted to be wrong, I wanted to be told ""Hey, ur just bad, here's a tip on how to overcome this"" But no. I'm sure some of you had those moments, maybe they're a lot more rarer than mine, how knows.   But yeah, I'm writing this, with pain and salt in my mind, having just uninstalled it after being deleted by my buddy playing Lidia and Reina.   Tekken is good game. but it's just not good for ME. So, I'm quitting for now.  Maybe I'll come back after a year or two, or when the heihachi DLC drops.  Maybe then it might feel better.   EDIT 25/9/2024 I recently reinstalled Tekken 8 after seeing heihachi, i got filled with hope and motivation. I joined some ranked matches and immediately get reminded of everything I had complained about in the above statement. Maybe it really is a skill issue, but once more.   Can't sidestep because I get locked in. People would rather mash their way out instead of going for parries and sidesteps or simply blocking and waiting for a gap. Which is fine! IF, it didn't work like 80% of the time.  Neutral? What's that? It's a contest of who can overwhelm the other guy first. Footsies only last for like 5 seconds before somebody, be it me, or the opponent, feels the compelling need to throw out some random heat move.  But compared to before, my head is clearer.   So I have suggestions, some of you might like it, some of you might not.  Ngl, KEEP OFFENCE THE SAME. I honestly think this is the most ""FUN"" Tekken in the same way that Guilty Gear STRIVE is the most ""FUN"" Guilty Gear to the masses.  My only problem is that as a player of both games, Guilty Gear has a more streamlined defence, block high, block low, occasionally try a parry and dust grab.  Tekken? You give me side steps, you give me Highs, Mids and Lows to worry about. You give me not just grabs, but different kinds of grabs from tackles, to feints, each with their own unique uses for repositioning, and unique ways to break them too. You give me power crushes, you give me while standings, all these moves, and I get to use NONE of them because I'm minus 100 and the Reina/Lydia/Lars/Victor/Jun is bullying me with their 50/50s and homing stance locks. Once again, maybe to the better players she's not an issue but wouldn't it be nice to actually be able to sidestep in what is basically the ONLY game worth playing that allows it?  TL:DR, Just buff defence. That's it, the options are there, just give the players more opportunities to use them and honestly the game will feel so much better.   Once again, I am the average purple rank player, I play this game for fun, climbing ranks? Sure it's nice to climb but at the end of the day what everybody wants is some GOOD A$$ TEKKEN. Maybe I'm just too defensive in an offense oriented game, but a majority of my playstyle's strength comes from defence. Maybe that's why I feel so limited?  EDIT 2 AS OF 26/10/2024  This time this is a salt review, THE GAME IS STILL TRASH NOTHING HAS CHANGED PEOPLE CAN JUST GET AWAY WITH SO MUCH FORCED 50/50s I DONT GET IT, I CAN'T SIDESTEP, I CAN'T PUNISH AFTER A SUCCESSFUL SIDESTEP (Though I skill issue on my part, I'm talking about the moves that just send the characters flying so far i.e. dragonouv smash) BACK TURN COMBOS ON THE ON THE WALL ARE STILL BEYOND JANK)   is this Tekken or is this 3d Strive man? Because if that's what your going for, Strive executes the aggression idea WAY BETTER.  You are NOT rewarded for having good defense in this game! (Typed this after losing to a sidestep stance spam jun and Victor with that lanky af CH launcher sweep)  Stuff needs to be more minus on whiff so people can't just throw stuff out willy nilly, that or make it so that sidesteps actually work, I swear, in one ranked session alone I have encountered FIVE SITUATIONS where I have sidestepped so hard, that I swapped sides with the opponent, ONLY TO GET HIT ANYWAYS?????  Good news tho, I reached Blue rank (it's the same issue there too...)  Also, I want characters that are hard to play because they require SKILL to use, not characters that are hard to play because they SUCK. Bamco wtf are you smoking with that DLC money bro.......  Edit fir 26/1/2024 Hey guys, I reached blue rank with 3 characters, Jin Paul, And Heihachi, and I'll be honest. Things haven't changed. My blue rank friend is now a Tekken Emperor and even he still agrees it's sort of the same up there in ramks, that is, mashfest. I've improved as a player and have come to realise that it's not neccessarily the characters in this game that are busted and moreso the game itself being busted. That is all.   Blah blah Defense should be buffed, blah blah 50/50 spamfest you know how it goes.  I do have one new complaint though, some characters just seem to have the weirdest autotracking stuff. You'd sidestep something flawlessly and still magically get hit by the second part of the move as they magically lock onto you.   As riduculous as it sounds, Armoured Core 6 (Another game I have been playing) Is a better and more fun fighting game than Tekken, and it's not even remotely close to a fighting game. Weird.  I'm not even writing this update with salt, I've gotten past the salt and reached the point where I'm just empty?  SEASON2... KMS"
192092168,english,0,1778820,"This prolonged April fools joke is getting a bit annoying, can we get the real season 2 patch now?  On a real note, this patch is the most out of touch thing I have seen in any game that I have ever played. What a great ""Defensive"" patch. This new era of Tekken is so void of character archetypes it's actually crazy. Every character is now a brain dead 50/50 stance character with homing plus frames mids and crazy lows.   Every character utilises the system mechanics exactly the same way. We got heat engage into crouch so of course every character needs a crazy full crouch low to be able to take advantage of that, right?  I don't know if this is fixable and at this point I kinda hope Tekken as a series dies, because Bandai Namco does not deserve more money. Let's hope another 3D fighter gets released that can replace Tekken."

It’s essential to take the art of Tekken seriously for self-improvement, and I’m beginning to question if this game’s current state supports that goal.  I’m not pleased with how this change has affected my character and the game overall. It feels as if I’m being pushed into a play style that doesn’t align with my approach. This patch has been incredibly frustrating and needs urgent attention. Despite all my hard work—practicing, studying my opponents, and analyzing gameplay—it all seems to lose meaning when I’m forced to eat unearned 50/50's and adopt a style more suited to a BlazeBlue character. Losing the essence of my character is something I cannot accept. At this point, I barely recognize who I’m playing and what I'm playing anymore...

191713020,english,0,1778820,I dunno man. This game increasingly favors the aggressive style of play and rewards the player for it. more 50/50 gets added to the game and defense feels worse every match.  I dunno why it is such a good feeling for players to framelock someone until their HP bar hits zero. Especially problematic in heat where you just block and pray to not die.   The best defense is offense here which destroys the punishment aspect of the game. I don't even feel like my opponent is reacting to my stuff. They are not thinking about what i'm doing they just force their offense on me and hope i didnt lab every DLC character.

I cannot recommend this game though, because of the despicable MTX practices they have decided to implement AFTER reviews were in. i believe buying costumes is an ok way to try to have fans continue to support the developers (as long as base game customization is great) EXCEPT when you CANNOT buy them directly and instead need to buy a premium in-game currency, as it can (and does) lead to overpaying/overspending. And now they have decided to introduce a battlepass which i believe is completely unnecessary, and another way to try to squeeze money out of players through FOMO. Overall this game is crazy fun and if you can ignore the MTX then please go ahead and buy it if that's what you want to do, but if you're on the fence and unsure whether you'd like it even after trying the demo, i would suggest not buying it to not support these greedy and anti-consumer practices."

191694778,english,0,1778820,"First time i post a review ever because i am baffled, i never seen devs so out of touch with the community...  New season dropped and they made every character into a braindead easy mix up machine without a single buff to defense, from the start of tekken 8 players where vocal about the prominess of easy mix ups and the glaring nerfs to defense compared to past tekken games and yet they do a huge patch with lots of new moves that enphasis on every aspect the players disliked about the game.  No one litterally no one asked for these changes, even new players never asked for more offense in a game that clearly lacks defensive options and is easy to mash button and win like in most Tekken games.  Tekken especially with competetive Tekken 7 scene garnered a reputation of a game that has solid focus on fundamental skill such as movement, neutral and defense and seeing how Tekken 8 nerfed all this aspects is sad, even the tournament views are worse for T8 compared to T7 for how homoginized the characters are and streamlined the gameplay is with new systems.  But i still had hope since things could change for the better. however devs turning a deaf ear on their community that was extremly vocal about all te negative aspects of the game which made the experience worse just to double down on what everyone hates for some fabricated notion that ""it's good for new players"" is incomprehensible when people loved Tekken 7 which was massively succesful for a fighting game."
191720018,english,0,1778820,"I do not recommend Tekken 8 season 2 for these reasons.  -The developers do not understand the characters they design. They see that the character has strengths and weaknesses and continue to not let them have this weakness. Instead, they homogenize the character to be like the others making them overtuned. This was a big issue in Season 1 that made 70% of the roster oppressive. And the game is suppose to favor the aggressor, but it favored the aggressor too much to the point where it will look like a one player game sometimes. There is very little counterplay to these characters. =Season 2 did not address these things, they only made minor defensive changes like being able to side step from crouch and side step buffer. But that is not enough as they decided to buff almost everyone while giving them major/minor nerfs. However, this isn't the only thing that makes it bad. They also killed character identities like Law's WS4 CH DSS not being a thing anymore, Zafina stances, Feng Wei snake dash block, etc. They gave characters like Dragunov some more identity which is cool, but no character should have their identity being killed or overtuned. All they did was buff the weaknesses of each character instead of just letting them have this weakness and just buff their strength instead. But the developers do not understand their character designs. -The developers also did not address any of the dumb tracking some of the moves have like the heat bursts. Yes, some of the Heat bursts like Bryans still track even though they aren't suppose to.  Also removing CH Ki charge is the worse change I've ever seen. No one complained about it and people liked it."

All of this is being included in a game that's plagued with many other issues that need urgent fixing, like wonky netcode, terrible balance and no real penalties for cheaters/rage quitters.

191130721,english,0,1778820,"""For Season 2, we'd like to focus on defense in terms of the lateral aspects of a 3d fighting game.""   Followed by the developers spending over two hours without mentioning any defensive changes and only focusing on more BS 50/50 casino gameplay is hilarious.   Oh right, some genius decided that you should be punished for breaking a throw correctly and take chip damage.   Would not recommend anyone purchasing this game until they actually improve defense/movement to counteract the constant aggression.   [b]EDIT:[/b] Just wanted to add some extra feedback in case the developers become truthful when it comes to taking feedback.  1. Remove Chip Damage completely: Its a garbage mechanic and makes being on the receiving end of heat even more frustrating because even if you block the mix-ups correctly you're still punished enough to where you'll often lose 40% of your life bar from just chip damage and be put in range to where the next mix up will kill you.  2. Buff Movement: Backdash needs to be buffed to bait and create whiffs otherwise Tekken turns into everyone just constant throwing out hitboxes without thinking knowing that at worst they will hit on block and often times be plus still. Sidesteps need tuning to be more reliable since they can fail even if using them in the same situation as one in which they've succeeded previously.  3. Fix Phantom hitboxes/Nerf range of moves/Nerf homing moves/Remove string realignment GLOBALLY: All of these changes will also help with the problem above. People would play a lot slower in neutral which builds tension, makes a defensive more viable and allows there to be more neutral interactions instead of each player trying to bulldoze their way into constantly being in close range forcing a guessing game.  4.Severely nerf heat: I would love to just remove it completely but its already built into the core Tekken system. Instead just make it so that heat is something you have to earn in a game and make it so that once you activate it the meter never stops going down. Remove the ability to regenerate heat from moves/stances. Nerf Heat smashes across the board so that they don't cause stage interactions or wall splat. Heat smashes being so overbearingly strong streamlines a lot of the game play especially against characters like Jin/Heihachi. I would make every heat smash +3 or less on block since even when you block such powerful moves correctly you have to guess again for your life with another unfair mix-up.  5.Lower the plus frames on moves across the board, +5 is crazy for heat dash considering its not even something you have to earn to be able to do when you have heat active. There are also too many high reward moves that are also +6 on block or higher... Why?  6. Remove Unbreakable grabs and guard breaks from the game. They are just way too powerful and mentally taxing to deal with. Guard breaks also often lead to wall splats or wall blasts which makes them low risk for too high of a reward."
191738401,english,0,1778820,"To preface this - it's currently the launch of season 2 of Tekken 8. I like Tekken, I've played Tekken since Tekken 2. I've played every Tekken game to date. I like this franchise so much that I've spent energy following it and playing it over the course of my life.  This game is quite possibly the worst Tekken game I have ever played. I would consider Death by Degrees to be more true to form to Tekken's formula and aesthetic than this game.   You can see right now I have hundreds of hours in this game, you might be asking why? If you don't like it - why spend so much time. Here's why - I have desperately tried to cling onto the idea that if I played enough/ranked up enough it would suddenly click. I've also always liked Tekken and didn't want to drop a franchise I've historically enjoyed so I thought I was missing something.  I wasn't and that point has been proven now.  Tekken 8 was given out to players initially as a review copy without a battle pass addition. Once official release came around a battle pass was added to bypass the review phase. This battle pass and each one afterwards till now contains items which were normally obtained in Tekken games through in-game currency obtained from Online Matches or Arcade mode or even other party modes added in previous games such as Tekken Bowling or Tekken Volleyball.  However with Tekken 8 this was a unwelcome surprise and now it requires real world money.  This is why Tekken 8 now has a asterisk with the message ""This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity"".  This is not one of those times.  With the launch of season 2 they emphasised that the updates would favour defence options a bit more. Currently plus frames are rampant with many moves or heat activations which leave no room at all for you to retaliate and certain characters are utterly broken. I don't mean overpowered either but they have them too.  Paul can currently do f,1+2 into while standing 3 and it will bypass the guarding system and hit every time. To go even further, he can press 2 after that unblockable ws,3 and if you're at the wall, you just got wall splat. Which will possibly lead to you losing the match because you anticipated the move coming and blocked like a normal sane individual (You shouldn't have done that).  There is a plethora of similar issues with the game right now. There are many reasons the game is in the state that it is in but it comes to who's currently in charge. This narrows down to Kouhei Ikeda now being game director and Harada becoming an adviser. All ""heat"" on this issue is directed towards Harada who is sun setting his time with Tekken. All positive notes to take from T8 will be accredited to Ikeda's work on the game. All drawbacks will be learned from for the next game hopefully but ultimately it's Ikeda's series now. Many Soul Calibur developers have transitioned to Tekkens development.  That is the state of Tekken 8's development right now.  There is a bunch of issues why the game is not good right now: Too many plus frames. No actual defensive options. Terrible Heat mechanic. Many moves hitting off axis. Combo damage is incredibly high. Too many stance transitions (Everyone is Lei now apparently). Stock/State Power ups. Chip Damage.  The aesthetic of the previous games' are also lost entirely. T4 still holds the bar for the best with so little to show for it. They only needed a hint of flashy stuff or ridiculous concepts in Tekken. If you look at Clive you can see that's been thrown out the window.  What's also really disappointing is that a lot of players have tried putting the thought into peoples head that previous Tekken games were worse and they don't have the stomach to actually say the series got worse.  It's a really funny twist of fate that Tekken Tag Tournament 2 didn't kill Tekken but Tekken 8 - their most lavish and expensive title to date is doing a better job than Tag 2 ever did."

They don't release normal patches, instead they release shi#ty DLC with characters that have nothing to do with Tekken and they're broken, we were promised that characters that have nothing to do with Tekken wouldn't appear there. Cheaters are still the same, both low ranked and high ranked, the search system is still the same crappy system where it can take 20-30 minutes to find an opponent.

But despite all this banco will release a collaboration with nike and make limited edition watches instead of good patches, congratulations, this is the worst fighting game ever.

Они не выпускают нормальных патчей, вместо этого они выпускают дерьмовые DLC с персонажами, которые не имеют ничего общего с Tekken, и они сломаны, нам обещали, что персонажи, которые не имеют ничего общего с Tekken, там не появятся. Читеры все те же остались, как на низкоранговых, так и на высокоранговых, система поиска все та же дерьмовая, где поиск соперника может занять 20-30 минут. Противники, которые кликают куда угодно и бьют чем угодно с защитой 30-40, просто отвратительны. Противник, который может ударить по воздуху и магическим образом попасть по вам, и при этом нанести контр-удар, даже если вы находитесь у него за спиной) Не нормально развитая система сайдстепов, где вы также можете получить удар от противника, который должен был промахнуться по вам, но увы, противник ударив по тому же воздуху может попасть по вам.   Но несмотря на все это banco выпустит коллаборацию с nike и сделает лимитированные часы вместо хороших патчей, поздравляю, это худший файтинг в истории. Единственное, что в нем хорошо - это графика.

This patch is a complete disaster that destroys the very essence of the game.  A chaotic gameplay experience The developers have completely shattered the game’s balance by making offense far too powerful. The game has turned into a mindless rushdown fest where defense, once a core pillar of the series, has become unnecessarily difficult. Reacting now requires an absurd mix of inhuman reflexes, encyclopedic knowledge, and lightning-fast analysis. Even worse, the game has become a never-ending lottery, a simple rock-paper-scissors match where luck outweighs technical skill. Every interaction feels like a gamble, making the experience frustrating and unbearable.  A disastrous development direction The decision to bring in SoulCalibur developers was a fatal mistake. Tekken is not SoulCalibur, and trying to force mechanics from a completely different game into Tekken’s system betrays the very DNA of the franchise. Harada and his team seem to have lost sight of what made Tekken a true fighting game masterpiece.  An outrageous price tag As if things weren’t bad enough, Bandai Namco is charging €40 for this mess! This price is absolutely ridiculous for a patch that turns Tekken into a game of pure luck. At this rate, I’d rather spend my money at the slot machines at the carnival—at least there, I know I’m gambling from the start.  An ultimatum for Tekken If this patch isn’t fixed soon, I’m done with Tekken. This is no longer the game I’ve known and loved for three decades. In its current state, it’s unplayable and no longer worth my time.  Bandai Namco, fix this before it’s too late!"

But there is a big problem, you can't use the DLC characters in training, and you are unable to view the replays of a match against a DLC character (if you don't own the character). You legitimately have to PAY to learn the matchups against these characters, which is honestly disgusting. I don't really care about the tekken coins stuff because all you can do is buy cosmetics with them, so that doesn't really bother me, but it is really scummy to add ""V-Bucks"" to a $90 CDN game a few months after launch.

It was weird when the characters talk each other in different languages. How do they understand each other in different languages? The arcade story was fine. The character stories was fine, it just beat 5 opponents to get a cinematic cutscenes. Some of few characters do have a funny cinematic cutscenes. The gameplay is great. I do like the combat system in this game. The combat animations were fast and smooth, making every fight feel incredibly dynamic. It's different from Tekken 7 like the heat system wasn't in older Tekken games. The graphics and the character models were stunning. The music in this game was so good and banger.

I am a Tekken veteran and I can assure you: This game is close to Guilty Gear Strive than Tekken 7/6 etc.  With the new S2 patch now every character got buffed, from an already to bloated and crazy standard. Basically everyone upgraded from a machine gun to a tactical nuke. The game is and will be so pressure and 50/50 focused, that you won't have fun as a defender.  Legacy stuff, like ki-charge and manual teching (backroll tech) have been removed, completely altering the gameplay and simplefying it.  As a through-and-through Tekken fan:  THIS GAME WILL MAKE ME DROP IT IN THE NEXT 7 DAYS! I urge every Tekken fan to give a negative review and minimize gameplay in order to give them a heavy hit, otherwise things won't change.  I hope I can prevent any old Tekken Fan from buying this game. It isn't worth it; at most as a casual and even then you won't have fun being stomped by your opponents.  Do better Team Tekken!"

173335493,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8, while undeniably more accessible than its predecessors, has stripped away much of the tactical depth that defined the series. The game feels like it's been simplified to cater to a larger player base, but at the cost of what made Tekken unique. What we're left with is a game that's largely about 50/50 situations, with little room for the nuanced, defensive play that even 2D fighting games manage to preserve.  One of the biggest disappointments for me is how defense is not only unrewarded but outright punished, particularly with the introduction of chip damage. In other fighting games, there are defensive tools to counterbalance aggressive play, but in Tekken 8, it feels like the game is designed to reward the player who can memorize the best combos and apply pressure non-stop. The Ranked matches exacerbate this issue, becoming a toxic experience where opponents either quit after one match, have unbearable lag, or exhibit other frustrating behaviors.  After over 100 hours of trying to give this game a chance, I've lost the drive to continue. I might revisit it if Kunimitsu is reintroduced, but for now, Tekken 8 is getting uninstalled. I'm finding more satisfaction in games like Guilty Gear Strive or Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, where my efforts in practicing hit confirms are actually rewarded, unlike in Tekken 8, where any attempt at analysis seems to get me punished anyway.  The final straw for me is the Battle Pass system, which feels even more intrusive and unpleasant in Tekken 8 than in Rising. It's a feature I genuinely dislike and it only adds to my overall disappointment with the game."
157756742,english,1,1778820,"[b]Tekken 8, the latest installment in the iconic fighting game franchise developed by Bandai Namco, continues to redefine the genre with its polished gameplay, stunning visuals, and diverse roster of characters. I am going to go into detail about this:[/b] [list] [*][b]Stunning Visuals and Immersive Environments:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 screams breathtaking graphics and brilliantly designed environments that put players in dynamic and vibrant battle arenas. From bustling city streets to serene natural landscapes and from there to Nightmare realities, each stage is a visual spectacle, enhancing the overall gaming experience.[/i]  [*][b]Refined Gameplay Mechanics:[/b] [i]Building upon its previous installments, Tekken 8 introduces refined gameplay mechanics that offer a perfect balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for Tekken Pros. The controls are responsive and creative, allowing players to execute complex combos and special moves with precision. I can also add executing combos that are just frames, are much more easily executable now.[/i]  [*][b]Diverse Roster of Characters:[/b] [i]With a diverse roster of characters, each with their own unique fighting style and backstory, Tekken 8 offers something for every player. From classic favorites like Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama to newcomers with innovative fighting techniques like Azucena and Victor, the character selection is vast and varied, and rumored to be becoming bigger and bigger in the coming years.[/i]  [*][b]Engaging Story Mode:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 features an engaging story mode that delves deeper into the rich lore of the Tekken universe. Players embark on a thrilling journey filled with intrigue, betrayal, and epic showdowns, unraveling the mysteries behind each character's motives, with the main story just based on the Mishima Bloodline.[/i]  [*][b]Robust Online Multiplayer:[/b] [i]The online multiplayer feature of Tekken 8 delivers an exhilarating experience, allowing players to test their skills against opponents from around the world. With robust matchmaking features and various online modes, including ranked matches and tournaments, the competitive scene is vibrant and engaging, the net-code is not perfect but its way better than the Tekken 7 when it came out back in the days. [/i]   [*][b]Customization Options:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 offers extensive customization options, allowing players to personalize their favorite characters with unique costumes, accessories, and cosmetic items. Also paying homage to other characters from the games like Resident Evil with adding their customized costumes in the game. From traditional martial arts attire to outlandish outfits, the customization options are virtually limitless, adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, so that my character may look cool while Kicking A$$.[/i] [/list]  [b][i]In the end I would like to add that Tekken 8 surpasses expectations as a fighting game masterpiece, combining stunning visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, with new Game Modes and a diverse cast of characters to deliver an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or new to the franchise, Tekken 8 offers something for everyone and cements its place as one of the finest fighting games of all time. I would recommend highly to anyone and to anybody who is into fighting games or not, as this will hook them up.[/i][/b]"

169651406,english,0,1778820,"There will be always be 50/50s in fighting games, but the keyword here is 'forced'—forced by the universal mechanic, not by the unique characters or player agency over them. When you factor in those heat interactions over all the sets, it becomes a core mechanic that decides the outcome of the match. It's as if it 'fills the entire game,' like an anchor point, and the characters' unique styles and stances take a back seat. The matches are way too fast and aggresive for any deliberate play.  Bottom line is, I hate the heat mechanic itself and want it gone. Heat engagers break momentum (like those long goddamn rage arts were not enough), push the other player to the wall, and force you to guess. Yes, it gives you a chance to redeem a mistake, but it's like the game is forcing me to play a certain way that I never asked for. I also have to use my heat, be aggressive, and win that one interaction or avoid losing to it, or the other player will force me to the wall. This was not the case in T7, as you could only do that with good reads and combo execution, not absurd pushbacks. T7 was also very good in terms of balance in season 5. Yes devs are 'fixing' the game but the game itself is the problem. They just want the fights to look good on streams and tournaments; hence heat, but they killed defense now there's no  turtle syle , baiting etc you just cant do it and there's no incentives its just mash mash heat engager  heat smash  forward momentum mash mash. I play when I can but I don't enjoy it as much as tekken 7, strangely it doesnt even feel good to win as its more mentally draining than fun imo. Maybe that just me idk."

176364038,english,0,1778820,"Probably the easiest and most aggressive entry in the series, Tekken 8 has solid features but is marred by scummy monetization policies. It feels like I'm playing a free-to-play, gacha game anytime there is a new update. Miss the latest DLC character? The main menu will remind you constantly of their presence, with the in-game store taking priority over the ""real"" menu, forcing you to navigate around it. This is unfortunate in a cheaper game, but understandable. It's unforgivable when the base cost is 70 USD, and another 40 for a ""character pass"" that includes 4 characters and nothing else.   More concerning is the way Bandai Namco handled this. The Tekken Team has always said one thing and done another regarding these policies. Murray and Harada were on record saying there would be no in-game store, battle pass, or loot boxes. But without fail, all of these things have come to pass. The only caveat is potentially the loot boxes -- the asset is currently being used to advertise bundled costume packages -- but give it time. Recently, Heihachi's stage was sold separately from his DLC -- a departure from Tekken 7's season pass, and the community has been up-in-arms over this. But I feel the Heihachi stage drama is  just a figurehead for a larger discontent that the community feels over constantly being asked to pay more and more for things that used to be free.   The game needs a change in direction ala No Man's Sky at this point to right the ship. There's too much negativity surrounding it, and Bandai Namco need to re-establish good will with their players. That's the only apology worth anything."
191694070,english,0,1778820,"Ill start off by saying i love Tekken and i don't want to see it fail. That being said if you are someone who, like me wanted to pick up Tekken because you saw the intricate movement, whiff punishment and defensive prowess of JDCR and you wanted to work towards that level then i have bad news for you. That is not this game. Tekken 8 went in a different direction, once you get past all the knowledge checks what you are left with in this game is an overabundance of canned mixups, oppressive frames and in general very few options to move around in 3 dimensions or play defensively. This isn't coming from a jaded legacy player either, my first Tekken was Tekken 7 and i have to say Tekken 8 has mostly moved away from what made me fall in love with it in the first place.  TLDR: I don't think this game is worth taking seriously as a competitive game. If you just wanna play it for shits casually it will probably be fun."
185237105,english,0,1778820,"Gameplay wise, it's nothing compared to previous Tekken games, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's designed to be more accessible, which is good, but the price for casual interest is very high. It's just a completely different game—one that rewards mindless offense and punishes defensive play styles, forcing players to just run at each other all the time.  If you're to play this game, understand that you'll get tons of games where you'll lose 70+% of your HP not because you played poorly, but simply because you guessed incorrectly. If someone with 5 hours can luck into a win against a higher-ranked player simply because that player guessed incorrectly, then we have a problem. Also understand that this version of Tekken is no longer a martial arts fighting game—expect to see and fight against guns, laser beams, dragons, Ifrit, and a lot more anime-looking stuff. If you just want down-to-earth martial arts, then maybe just wait for the new VF game 🤷🏽.  And oh, I'm not even gonna talk about the whole DLC mess (releasing the shop months after release to avoid bad reviews, putting legacy characters (and a stage) behind a paywall, etc. There's already a lot of reviews about that, here and on other platforms."
191850184,english,0,1778820,"As a player with over 3500 hours in Tekken 7 I was very excited to see what the next entry in the series would be. My review is being written as of Day 3 of Season 2.  [h2] Network and PC performance [/h2] When the game released on PC it still had performance and network issues that were reported in the network test. As a user with a custom build machine that is tuned well and can play all the latest games on highest settings Tekken 8 still has performance issues at times. Every time I am on the character select screen the game will become slightly choppy when swapping and selecting characters. The game can sometimes crash on PC. Users that played Tekken 7 on PC will remember if you would alt tab there was a chance the game would crash. This is still on ongoing issue with Tekken 8.  Regarding net code issues, it still feels like Tekken 7 season 4. I am not a developer so I do not know what can be done to improve the net code but it is sad to see a fighting game release in the year that it did (2024) and have such poor net code when other titles like street fighter 6 and guilty gear strive have phenomenal roll back net code.   [h2] Presentation + content [/h2] The costume redesigns the characters received are a warm welcome and do a lot for the returning cast. The music and stages in the game are brilliant. Tekken 8 honestly has one of my favourite soundtracks in the series. I was really looking forward to the story mode as I was invested in seeing what happened after the ending of Tekken 7. The story mode was brilliant and is easily my favourite one iv played in a fighting game. Hopefully we can see a big follow up during a DLC release for Tekken 8.  Customisation is cool and I hope it continues to see free updates over time. The jukebox features is something I always wanted for PC users so it's nice to see us finally get it after missing out on it being a PS4 exclusive for Tekken 7.  I do wish there was more game modes available to play. For example having Team battle come back from the older entries would be really fun for offline play with friends or online in private lobbies.  [h2] Gameplay [/h2] This entry is very rewarding for aggressive play. The new heat system promotes players to stay on the offensive rather than  using movement and blocking to counter play their opponent.  With the new chip system you are punished for blocking and trying to play slowly to get into a better position. This is a huge change in the direction from the previous entry (Tekken 7) where you could use that games movement system to block and take your time to get out of situations. Since Tekken Tag tournament 1 (1999) players have been using movement (Korean back dash cancelling + sidestepping) to avoid these guessing situations and create whiff opportunities however with Tekken 8 having nerfed movement  (With season 2 they have buffed side steps which is nice but back dash cancelling still feels horrible) you will find yourself at times being forced to guess on a 50/50.  I think some of the hit effects are too much. When Clive activates heat and starts doing through his moves it really takes away from the fight and is too distracting.   Every member of the roster got some new tools coming into Tekken 8.  Characters have new single hit and combo strings to change how their game play looks and feels. Some users may find characters play vastly different than their previous entries (Jack-8) is a great example of this.  I think it is important that characters feel unique and have clear defined strengths and weaknesses. I am unsure what approach the developer team are taking with Tekken 8. But it feels to me that characters are starting to feel similar and lose their identity which is a first for a series that has so many unique and interesting characters. Take King for example. Does he need to have the best counter hit string in the game (DF+2,1) which you can hit confirm for a full combo? This does not make sense to me. As a wrestler type character he should be more focused on doing big single hits and using his cool chain throws.   There are currently 14 characters in the game with the guard break mechanic (Bryan, Clive, Devil Jin, Feng, Heihachi, jack, Kuma, Lidia, Panda, Paul, Reina, Shaheen, Steve, Yoshimitsu) which will break through your block and guarantee a follow up vs you.  In Tekkn 7 only two characters had this functionality (Lidia and Fahkumram) with Bryan also has a unique version of this mechanic since Tekken 3 (Taunt). Seeing it become such a normal part of the game really has made it no longer feel special.   With the latest update to the game (Season 2) we were expecting the developers to tone down how aggressive the game is and show us what defensive options they were working on. Since the latest patch characters across the board have become even stronger and more oppressive. More characters have access to 100+ dmg combos without rage and new tools to force you to block and guess on a 50/50 as you cannot use movement to escape situations. Chip damage is still a massive issue and heat lasts for too long when activated.  There are also currently some game breaking bugs from characters such as jack and Paul that have new moves that seem to have slipped past testing and are causing interactions that were not intended. It being only day 3 of season 2 more bugs could be found in the coming days/weeks. Hopefully we get an emergency patch to fix them.  [h2] Closing thoughts [/h2]  I am not sure what the future holds for the game.    I feel like Bandai Namco have been developing Tekken 8 to be enjoyable for the user on the attack without thinking how does it feel to be the user on the defending side.  Just because being on the offensive feels good doesn't mean being on the defending side has to feel bad. But with the core systems in place for Tekken 8 that is exactly how the game feels. From speaking with casual and pro players it does not seem that either group is happy with the direction the game is going.   I think the developers have lost sight of what made Tekken so much fun. It wasn't big flashy hit effects, over powered moves, characters having no defined weaknesses.  [list] [*] It was the unique characters and their specifics strengths. [*] It was seeing someone put years into a character and mastering what their specific game plan was and aspiring to be that great. [*] It was being a new player and seeing a clip of someone moving around the screen fast thinking ""Wow how are they moving like that??"". [*] It was the people who took the time out of their day to host online and offline events just for people to show up and play their favourite fighting game. [*] It was seeing people coming together from different countries to compete and change their lives [/list]  [b] It was the community.[/b]  And right now it feels like the developers are no longer listening to the community.  You can do as many collaborations and have as many guest characters as you want. If no one is around to play the game who will purchase the future dlcs you make?  I am lucky enough that I have a healthy offline scene of cool people who play for fun and want to improve. I hope the developers can open up a bit more with the community and maybe reach out for more feedback on future patches or ideas they have.  Everybody who purchased Tekken 8 loves the series. We just want to see it go in a different direction than the current one.  All the best   o/"

UDATE#2: Added Note as of 6/4/24:   BATTLE PASS ROUND 1 has ended and literally nothing replaced it. Menus are missing or empty. I did not buy it and frankly don't care- But I want people scoping these reviews to see that in a $70 game, Namco is late on a seamless Battle Pass for this ""Live Service"" Game.   Absolutely hilarious.   The hits keeps coming!  UPDATE #3 7/21/2024: They did it- Namco really did.   They added in-game advertisements to a stage for NIKE shoes... Namco just spent an HOUR at a panel discussing Nike Foamposite Tekken shoes and the BOX they come in... at EVO?! WTF!  Nike is historically known for Sweatshops and ruining communities in 3rd world countries. Why put this in the game? GREED STRIKES AGAIN!  Chipotle too!?   You know, the restaurant chain that is mainly in the US? Yeah- You can earn in-game content by beating King in the battle lounge starting 7/23. This game and all of the additions to it are not for the community or for the playerbase- It seems to be all for Ads, selling stuff that has little to do with the playerbase and is prioritized to make money for Namco.   I already paid $70. So did you (or even more).   Please don't support this. If you love Tekken- don't take this lying down. It will continue to get worse as Namco uses these scummy and dishonest tactics to squeeze as much money and profit as possible... Namco is using these moments to test what they can get away with.

Players expected the stage to be included. It was never announced i would be paid content. Lidia's stage was free...   LOL Original Post (because it continues to evolve)  I am sad about the MTXs and the lazy, absolutely disgusting reused assets from Tekken 7 filling their introductory Battle Pass. These items were held back from launch on purpose just to be dumped in this battle pass. If they are not from Tekken 7- take a look at Tekken Tag 2... Again, reused assets.  These scummy MTXs and Battle Pass were purposefully not discussed before launch and was added 2 months after launch- to sidestep reviews and negative reports. Don't let NAMCO ignore us or move on from this.  This is not Tekken.  This is an example of creating a problem purposefully and selling the solution.   DLC characters if not purchased cannot be labbed against in 10 second drop-in battle replays- a  feature advertised and promoted before launch and in the base-game before MTXs and DLC  were announced or released. Why?    Why is an UNREAL and Blender BALL asset (you can't even defend this Namco) being an item on the battle pass? This has got to be one of the scummiest and laziest battle passes I have ever seen in a game period- And it was  $70 on top of that. NAMCO should be ashamed! To put it in perspective- this ball can be added into UE by making 4-6 clicks.  I know why...

Truly disgusting behavior, and something many people seemed okay with, which wasn't surprising given how soft the gaming community has become regarding this type of stuff. I asked Valve to refund my purchase, because this was not something I wanted to support, and I was denied due to [i]""more than 2 hours played and 14 days passed since purchase.""[/i] Let's just ignore the publisher knowingly misleading their players, and changing the [i]ESRB[/i] rating later to include those succulent words we all crave to hear, [i]""In-game purchases.""[/i]  But [i]Bandai[/i] is a double G—[b]greedy[/b] and [b]glutenous[/b].

But it's the motion of the ocean that counts! And, oh boy, [b]did it rock my boat![/b] The 26th just couldn't come soon enough.  The gameplay shocked me by how easily I jelled with it. Fast, flashy, and furious, yet it was welcoming to a complete noob like myself. I was loving the learning process, and it didn't feel overwhelming. I even managed to get gud at doing some simple combos and air juggling, so that's nice. And I love the new gameplay addition—the [b]Heat[/b] system. Being able to stop my opponent's attack flow by using the [b]Heat Burst[/b] attack, which is uninterruptible, is music to my ears. Sure, you can easily block it, but this is where the fun begins—[b]trying to time it, [i]just right![/i][/b] Plus, the [b]Heat Engager[/b] and [b]Heat Smash[/b] [i](I do be engaging in smashing)[/i] attacks can be used to extend combos and deal even more damage in the process. Simply majestic. The trade-off is that [b]Heat[/b] only lasts 15 seconds. But do you really need more than that? Sometimes less is more, you know.  Speaking of cool attacks, [b]Rage Art[/b] is present once again. This is essentially a super funky high-damage special move you can only do when your health is low. I can't count the number of times using it saved my noob behind from dying. And I gotta say, they are always a treat to watch. [b]This superbly animated sequence, combined with the game's insane visuals, sparks joy each and every time I watch one play out.[/b]  And all the fighting is [i]extra[/i] spiced up by the crazy amount of special effects on the screen each punch, kick, grab, or flying leg kick thrown produces. I can't explain why, but I love the sight of them. [b]It makes watching the punch land that much more oh-so-satisfying.[/b] The animations are also fantastic, further adding to the amazing feel of the combat.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260998 The visuals are simply insane. [i][b]Unreal Engine 5[/b][/i] shines, and so do daddy Kazuya's massive [i]pecs[/i]! Everything, from the arenas, some with multiple rooms you can blast your opponent into, to the character design, is superb and extremely rich in detail. Just amazing stuff. But there's one complaint from me—[b]Paul lost his iconic hair and looks like a Karen[/b] (why [i]Bamco?[/i]).   Also, if you enjoy character customization as much as I do (a lot), then the Arcade Quest mode will be your wet dream. Here, all bets are off, and we'll get free reign over how our fighters look. Will they look wacky? Yes. Creepy? Also yes. Lewd? [b]Hopefully.[/b] Giving players more customization options and freedom is always a plus in my book!  Lastly, the over-the-topness of the story seems to be intact.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260668 I can't wait to see what one of gaming's most dysfunctional families, the Mishimas, is up to. Likely a lot of half-naked men fighting each other, preferably near a cliff, volcano, or maybe a cliff overlooking a volcano. We shall see.  Simply put, [b]it's all (gonna be) perfect![/b]  And after having written 99 reviews, my 100th review will be the first and last [i]improper[/i] one. But [i]Tekken 8[/i] deserved this sacrifice, as it reignited my passion for gaming when no other game could.  So, thank you, [i]Tekken 8.[/i] Thank you to all the developers who poured their hearts and souls into this game. Lastly, thanks to all of you, top bananas, for coming to my [b]TEK[/b]talk. I hope you all enjoy [i]Tekken 8[/i] as much as I am.

168337995,english,0,1778820,"Despite all the 5 balance patches, the game is a complete mess. Granted it is better than it was at launch, but the amount of busted op moves is still insane. So few characters have well defined strengths and weakness. Its just a case of find your 3 op moves on that character, spam the crap out of them. Defence does not matter anymore, side stepping is so weak, so many moves have insane plus frames and give 100% follow ups. I loved t7, and was so excited for t8 but this game isnt fun. I can count the amount of good enjoyable fights on one hand. In 88 hours, thats a joke."

Not only it respects it's audience, It's also an improvement over it's predecessor in every single way and stands alongside 3 as the best game in the series.   Not enough people praising how a game that looks this good is running this well as well. I don't think I've seen many games look as stylish and as beautiful as this game does. The movements and combos are meaty, the sounds are punchy and give feedback, a real technical marvel.  I only wished there were more unlockables like the old school entries, it would feel much better unlocking the characters as you finish stuff as it also would give you an incentive to play more on the down times and to give more meaning to complete other modes. The online functionality is working perfectly, had absolutely no problems playing against strangers and friends alike, except for getting my butt kicked, but that's a granted.

192049829,english,0,1778820,"💀 1,100+ hours to end up with season 2. I've played this game almost every day since release. I loved Tekken 8. It wasn’t perfect, but it felt like high speed chess especially for someone new to fighting games. Now? It's overly aggressive, and most matches feel like coin flips thanks to constant 50/50s.  -Damage is completely out of control  -Pressure is nonstop. Defense gets punished harder than offense  -Some characters straight up feel like final bosses  -It’s so offense heavy I feel like I lose just for trying to KBD  Until they fix the balance and bring back some defense, I’m tapping out of ranked. Maybe even the game entirely. This was my favorite game. :(  (Yes, I'm writing this after an unholy loss streak. Let me cope.)"
165228643,english,0,1778820,"Disappointing is an understatement when it comes to Tekken 8.   This game I will admit I was hyped. Seeing the game play and all the crazy stuff they added looked interesting. Oh boy I was wrong. This game is just a party game that gives anyone a chance to win. You could outplay someone 9-1 but you have to remember the opponent has that 1 and they destroy you because they press their special win button (heat). Heat is a pretty big problem, the single player mechanic it gives isn't fun. I hope they balance heat out but we will see in the future.   I've played ranked for at least 150 hrs getting to the top ranks and I can tell you that ranked and the online play is flawed in many ways. The ranking system is really bad, if you get demoted you have a chance to get that rank back again. It isn't like Tekken 7 when you get demoted you get sent all the way back. But I think this is more for the casual gamer so they don't get demoralised which I understand but why allow it for high ranks? Don't get me started with the plugging (rage quitting) that comes with this game. 7/10 matches you will get a rage quit because the bans are manual from their end. The ban system is really whack, I could hop on like Fariborz or LawofEngland with my macros and not get punished for it. Even if I get banned I can use family share to hop onto another account.   Tekken shop is a disaster, I love getting costumes that modders themselves put into the game for free. The devs had the audacity to screw them over by DMCAing them all so they had to take their mods down. Also the devs have made it super clear they really want to focus on the Tekken shop for obvious reasons because it is their second hand income.   I will change this review when things get fixed and that but I don't suggest at the current state of the game to get it. I will say get it on a sale or wait for patches that fix the problems.   Update Season 2: Soul Calibur 6 devs ruined the game by adding 50/50 which makes the game 2 touch, there is still no skill in the game. Anyone can literally win against a solid player because not everyone is perfect with defence. It is a shame that the game is getting tarnished like this, the copium is gone. o7  Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
166573886,english,0,1778820,"After putting a good amount of hours into the game and reaching High purple/Low blue ranks, I can honestly say that this is the least amount of fun I've ever had with a Tekken game. The amount of catering to new players and spamming playstyles makes the game feel like a coinflip. The introduction of armored powercrush moves, the heat system as a whole, and the return of rage arts makes the game feel like garbage. Movement/sidestepping doesn't feel as rewarding when the opponent can just mash 2+3 and catch you regardless of positioning. The roster is great....the only problem is that you don't see 80% of it in online matches because King/Dragonov/Victor/Reina exist.  For $80 I could have gifted all of my friends a coinflip simulator instead and had about the same amount of fun.  Every match feels the exact same. Apply pressure>Opponent activates heat>Negative frames>Opponent 50/50's>Block for neutral frames>Opponent Powercrushes>Hard knockdown>Wakeup>Block>Take 30% of healthbar from chip damage>Punish>Combo>Opponent Rage Art/Heat Burst>Round lost. Literally every game.   More floor/wall breaks, untechable grabs in certain situations, Dragonov, Losing health on certain inputs that are 100% necessary for relevant combo damage, Dragonov, GOD AWFUL TRACKING/MOVEMENT, No penalty/reward when an opponent ""plugs"", Dragonov, extremely poor matchmaking balance, poor character balance, fan service, the list goes on.  I had high hopes for Tekken 8, but honestly I'm just disappointed. Will likely stick to 2D fighters where things work as intended and make sense.  60% win rate and still deranking. GG Harada.  MONETIZATION IS NOT THE ISSUE."
159573686,english,0,1778820,"Anyone remember back when in Tag 2 Harada said it was wrong to release characters as paid DLC in a fighting game? Then he backtracked on Tekken 7, where the total DLCs cost more than the base game. Then he went even further beyond in Tekken 8 and nerf the customization items, so you have to pay to get more clothing options. What is going to get nerfed in Tekken 9 next? Paying for song choices?  I paid for the ultimate edition just to support this franchise, despite the sh*tty golden clothing no one ever wears... but had I known this in-app purchases would become a thing for Tekken 8. I honestly wouldn't have bothered.  Guess I will learn my lesson for the next Tekken.  EDIT: THE NIBBARINOS AT BAMCO ADDED BATTLE PASS? AYO WTF?!"

178123323,english,0,1778820,"Edit: 4/1/2025  The Devs just released the worst balance patch they probably ever could have for this game. They doubled down on the features that the entire community disliked and told us that this was a patch that would give us more defensive options. By defensive options they meant here are more plus frame moves to force your opponent to block and guess and you need to out mash your opponent for optimal gameplay.  The developers at this point obviously think the community is a bunch of kids who dont know what they want and they absolutely know best so we should just all take it.  Screw that this game sucks ass, do not buy it for Season 2 till they make significant changes.  Original Review: Balance aside, the game launched and then an updated added an in game store revealing why we were missing cosmetics from Tekken 7. Then the battle pass came, and now whenever you login you get 20 notifications saying you got x item or check out the battle pass.  It feels very scummy and they didnt allow season pass owners to get a stage with Heihachi. They are just trying to suck the money out of the playerbase."

159548573,english,0,1778820,"This game is in a very though position to talk about for me. The design behind Tekken 8 forces you to forget almost everything you already know from Tekken, in a fundamental perspective. Characters have lost their identity in general because of game design itself. Most of the cast have a very powerful 50/50, momentun is not a thing since the game greatly benefits you for mashing. The more you mash, the farther you can climb, theres no other way to say this. There is just way too many powerful strings that will make you eat one 50/50 after another. Completely removing one way to play and forcing another feels wrong and I can't understand this game, it's just casino simulator. I've been playing Tekken for almost 10 years and this just feels like something else and I cannot say what it is.  Rank system is garbage and frustrating. It's just not fair to be going with like 7 to 9 win streak in a higher rank (talking about bushin, tekken king, kishin and so on) and only be getting 100 to 200 points maximum per match, and when you lose ONE match (not the ft2, just one match) you lose 1.500 points in just o n e match, even if it is one rank higher. This is just unfair. It would make sense in a lose streak, not in a win streak.  Characters have no real weaknesess, power crush mid that is also heat engager AND safe is stupid. There is a lot wrong with this game and I don't feel like it will be getting fixed anytime soon, I do actually belive that it will become worse if the standard balancing keep going in the casino direction (Eddy).  If you are not playing offense offense offense in this game, you are just dead. Even if you have good defense, the punish you usually get from reading your opponents is not a big of deal most of the time (you can tell by the rage art not being universally launch punishable). Theres soooo many bad decisions in this game that I can't see myself playing much more of this. It's tiring, not fun and stressful.  I think I don't even need to say anything about microtransactions coming out of nowhere, a BUNCH of them added in just a few days. Tekken Shop and Battle Pass??? Battle pass is just greedy since it's just a bunch of items from Tekken 7 and retextures. They didn't even put some efforts in hiding it.  In a much more casual level, this game is amazing, looks awesome and feels very good to play, but thats about it."
160056517,english,1,1778820,"One line review: Tekken8 is amazing.  Slightly expanded review: Probably the biggest leap in quality since Tekken2->3, 8 refines the mechanics from T7, adds modern controls a la SF6, hugely improves the graphics and sound, adds cross play and PvP rematches and makes the game much more accessible to boot. It also adds a real money shop, which, well, is not popular, but is also entirely ignorable.  The sound in particular is great - a blocked quick jab might sound a bit mid, but most hits sound like a damn gunshot and add a heck of a lot to the atmosphere.  The cast of characters is also diverse and fascinating, from giant hugely hard hitting war robots to a hyperfast peruvean coffee-saleswoman who likes nothing more than doging your attacks to hit you from the back, literal devils and demons, a chavvy kind of boxer, a hotheaded taekwando expert, happy shopper bruce lee, a giant championship wrestler who think he's a cat, two kinds of bear, knock-off magic Blade, a gun-toting cyro-frozen irish assassin, a french spymaster who thinks karambit knives are somehow acceptable in a fist fight, a space alien octopus robin hood ninja thing, an egyptian lady who has the literal god of war stuck in her hand somehow and a good two dozen more. More will come with DLC, ofc, but there are plenty to choose from and lots to experiment with.  The really great thing about tekken is that it has an almost abyssal level of depth, with so many mechanics, both new and old. Now this might seem like it would make the game hard to learn, especially if you're new to the series, but it's also really intuitive. You have four buttons, left and right kicks, and left and right punches. That's it! If you want to do a quick right left combo, you press right punch, then left punch. Easy.  If you have good timing, are patient and understand distancing even a little bit, you really don't even need a tutorial, it's that welcoming.  Now, all the above is really only about the PvP mode(s). SP has always been a bit thin in tekken games, but fwiw, I think it's probably at it's best here; there's the campaign which to its credit has tried to mix things up a bit, character episodes which also focus on the non-mainstream characters a bit more, arcade and arcade quest mode and also ghost battles. I guess it's alright? Tekken ball makes a return from 3, which is great, but you can't play it online for no good reason I can think of (e: you can, im just a big dummy, see comments), but the SP definitely takes a back-seat to the PvP modes.  There's also a bunch of nice touches, like how you can play as Tekken3 Jin, how the characters have rivalries and neat fight intros with their nemeses, replays which have advice when you watch them, kazuya's tits are FINALLY splashed all over the main menu*, there is the customary Tekken silliness, weirdness and ott anime moves and also Heihachi Mishima, possibly literally the most terrible person in the world, and easily the worst parent ever has died**. And then reincarnated as his own illegitimate daughter who is, if anything, even more horrifying to fight against. And she also has the devil gene that is basically the reason for everyone fighting in the first place, because of course she does.  One of my most favourite things is hwoarang mirror matches, which usually devolve into showing off, doing the flashiest moves you can and then get to the point where you are just improvising and re-interpreting each others combos in a sort of synchronised dance-off. It's just amazing to be a part of.  Edit: ok im going to write a bunch more about hwoarang and how his depiction in this game is just amazing. See taekwando, as a practiced olympic/ competitive sport, is quite a lot different than it was originally. Now, its about scoring points by, ideally, a spin kick to the head which counts for the most. So, in this game, hwo has a LOT of flashy high kicks which do a lot of damage, while smaller jabs and kicks serve to put the opponent in a place where high kicks count. It's kinda wonderful, really. Even better is that he had a tutor, Baek Doo San, who exemplifed the older more traditional style and now he has some of Baek's moves, rounding out his repertoire and showing he leant from his tutor.  *: Now you can choose which character you see  **: He's alive now, ofc  If you want an example of how silly it can get, here's Panda winning the tournament and then failing to deal with a chair: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dOp9YUJ_ow  I like it. I think it's great and i'm going to play some more right now. But I'm still terrible at it."

188007133,english,0,1778820,"While currently the overall reviews for this game are positive, most of the players that initially played and left their positive review are unfortunately gone.  The game is simply not fun to play at the state it's in. The character balancing is almost non existent in my opinion. The characters that were strong at the launch of the game are still strong a year later. They have pushed out balance changes during the year nerfing some of those characters, but it wasn't enough.  The 3D aspect of the 3D fighting game is more of a gimmick now than it ever has been. If you try to utilize the 3D aspect and sidestep, you can and most likely will at times get punished for trying seeing as a lot of moves track absurdly. The tracking should be heavily changed and nerfed, if you sidestep properly you should be rewarded, the opponent shouldn't just auto-realign to you during their strings. Some moves track right or left and you have to sidestep into the other direction. Some of those same moves track almost a full 180 (some track, but not that much), which leads to confusion as you will get hit when you're sidewalking and are almost behind the opponent.  With a lot of moves tracking where they shouldn't, if you add in absurd hitboxes you get the current condition of Tekken 8. Phantom hitboxes are a thing and I think that's fine as long as it's not too much. But if you add in the fact that when you sidewalked and are beside your opponent while he's doing his move. If you try to attack him before he's done you can and will get hit first yourself. By attacking you extend your hurtbox and for whatever reason there's a big chance you get hit first. That's just stupid.  Season 2 is around the corner, hopefully we will see some improvements.  EDIT: Season 2 is ass"

189798484,english,0,1778820,"This game Is hands down the worst Tekken ever made to date. First, the game is designed to be a button mashing fest where low level and high level gameplay look identical due to the extreme lack of depth in this game. Secondly, the monetization is so bad they re-release content from TEKKEN 7 and charge you for it in their battle pass. Thirdly, character move-sets have been homogenized to the point all characters essentially do the same thing. There are no longer interesting play styles and archetypes in this game. Finally, the story has to be one of the worst written, cringe inducing stories I have had the displeasure of playing. At first it was so bad it was good but now, with the inclusion of Heiachis story the story is an absolute joke. I am a huge Tekken fan and have never been particularly good at Tekken. I got to fujin as my highest rank in Tekken 7 and enjoyed every step of the way including the loses. There was always something to learn and something to improve at. There is always a point in all fighting games where they become 50/50 fiestas and if you enjoy that all power to you, but one thing is certain, this game is not Tekken anymore."
191785769,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 is a game where at ""Tekken King"" you will run into players who cannot break throws, panic rage art the frame they get it, mash at -23, and have no idea how to tech roll or get up from the ground. This was called ""Yellow Rank"" in Tekken 7 but ranked in this game is more akin to the Special Olympics."
176382192,english,0,1778820,"Once legendary fighting game series has lost its way.  It's now tainted with shady monetization practices, questionable ""casino"" gameplay mechanics, nonsensical character balancing and each dlc character is guaranteed to be so overpowered at launch... It's near pay to win.   I've been a fan since Tekken 1 and it's bizarre to see where the series has gone. The once focus on real life fighting styles is also gone and replaced with lasers, guns and other projectiles.  The ultimate edition does not include all dlc (even in the first season). Truly something that would make Ubisoft executives proud.  I hope Tekken team starts to focus more on the core gameplay and less on the atrocious  cosmetics.  Update after Season 2  Movement is pretty impressive now. Tekken team hinted for months about this S2 patch that would balance the game and make defense more feasible....however they have doubled down and made the ""casino"" gameplay even more extreme. The most viable strategy now is to rush down your opponent before they rush you. A pretty sad state of affairs could have been avoided if the devs made gradual small changes; instead of one huge patch with very significant changes, withheld from the community until the very launch.  I was excited to pre order the $100 version of the game when it first was announced. Since then there have been: a battle pass and an in game shop added just post launch Paid cosmetics and a paid stage not included in the $100 version of the game and the game now is so far from what Tekken is that it should probably be named something else.  In its current state Tekken 8 is similar to that time you were finished playing the witcher 3 and started watching the netflix adaptation expecting more good content.  After playing since Tekken 1 and being around in the arcade glory days, I guess this is where I get off.  I truly do hope that Harada and crew can get their act together and get this series back to its glory days...I will pass on S2 dlc until then."
191782728,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 is my first Tekken and I main Reina. I love her and this game to pieces. I've always understood why people preferred the defensive playstyle of previous Tekkens, but I enjoyed the aggressive focus of this game. I felt the aggressor should be rewarded for taking risks, not punished. Defence was now something IMPRESSIVE instead of just being a backdash magic 4 fest. You were still REWARDED for good defence despite it being harder.  I understand this game wants to focus on aggression and appealing to new players and I don't see the point of doing Tekken 7 again. But this is terrible guys. Terrible. You've turned most characters' rushdown into the most braindead, button mash fest it's ever been. Defence isn't hard anymore, it's IMPOSSIBLE. Everyone has good Mid/Low mixes regardless of if they deserved it or not. Character identity is being shot down in the street by removing execution and weaknesses. It is NOT FUN to play a character with NO EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS and NO WEAKNESSES. I am a new player who picked up a MISHIMA. Why do you think new players are some TikTok braindead idiots? And why are you trying to appeal to them when Tekken is famously difficult so they're not going to waste their time on it anyway? And why do your changes not even encourage TikTok braindead idiots to play because they, like everyone, are incapable of guessing correctly more than 50% of the time??? Are you guys just homogenising the cast because it's easier to balance? Why do we pay you then?  Not only is the balance of this patch in SHAMBLES because you removed so many character weaknesses so now they're just perfect. This patch is BUGGED too! Paul has an unintentional unblockable. There are numerous camera glitches resulting in unintentional wall splats. Steve qcf1 STILL randomly whiffs. On and on and on, and guaranteed there will be more the longer the patch is up. Not to mention all the new animations look TERRIBLE. Speeding up animations like Feng's qcf1 makes it look unnatural. Or Reina's d2, 1+2 just copy and pasting her 1+2. Pigeon Roll from Dragunov looks silly. Feng's b4, 2 doesn't match his fighting style at all or even look like a real attack. So you're telling me you spent 4 months on this patch not only for it to be unbalanced, but it also lacks ANY SENSE of quality control? What have you guys been doing all this time to not even test for BUGS?  Worst of all, it has been 24 hours since the patch dropped, and you guys haven't reverted the changes, temporarily taken down the servers or even SPOKEN to us. Not even assured us that you're on it and things will be okay. I still have faith you can fix this, but I'm losing faith that you can balance this game or that you care enough about the pros livelihood or what people sacrifice to try get good at this game. You're gonna do this again. Just like you've added hatchet kicks to characters who don't deserve it multiple times. Given characters tracking Hellsweeps multiple times. Given tracking plus on block moves to characters multiple times.   I don't know what you guys need to change to get it together, but change it and GET IT TOGETHER."

The Side-Step 3D element is ruined by half of the abilities homing. Blocking is a joke when you get slowed with negative frames or take massive chip damage. Everyone has an easy 50% damage launch combo that takes longer than a turn based RPG. Cheating is Rampant and unmanaged... I could go on and on.  If you are a button masher, or a self hating tryhard that is willing to study an impossible amount of frame data to tilt a 50/50 in your favor, you might enjoy this game. If you are sane and just want a simple game where you tussle and express skill, then I wouldn't call this a true fighting game."

Stages have gameplay impact meaning if you care about getting good you need to buy them and practice on them. Your wallet does impact your ability to improve in this game, and the game cost 70 dollar to start with.   Avoid this game for now. The devs doesn't respect you or your time."

Hardly any counterplay, complete homogenisation of pretty much the entire cast with strong mids and power lows, spike enders at the wall, homing attacks when we were going to ""buff sidesteps.""  Season 1 wasn't perfect, far from it, but we were getting used to it and counterplay was being discovered constantly. Whilst the homogenisation problem was still present, ever since T7 I'd argue, characters did indeed feel unique. Now everyone can be plus, have strong counter hits, hit the wall from any point on the stage, just do anything and everything.   In summary, this game doesn't feel like Tekken anymore. Genuinely a hollow shell of what could've been a great game. I'm out, 1.3 seconds."

163347987,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 has all the makings of a great game, but once again, Namco seems determined to fumble the ball when it counts most. We're just a couple of months into the game's life, and instead of tackling real issues, Namco seems set on sabotaging its own growth.  I can't recommend the game at it's current state. Devs are either overworked or completely incompetent. Every balance patch they break more things than they fix. Also they would rather change the core game system instead of target nerfing a single character, which results in even more unintended bugs and interactions in the game (broken wall combos, floors not breaking, etc.). They tried to nerf the obnoxious Azucena WR3,4 and it ended up being a buff because you can't even punish it on whiff.  Accidental buffs? Sound familiar? They did the exact same thing when they wanted to nerf Akumas techroll catch in Tekken 7. Instead of target nerfing the problematic interaction, they made a system-wide nerf to tech catches, which ended up taking away a layer of mindgame at the wall for every character. And the best part is, Akuma could still do the tech catch. They've done this many times before and they will do it again, because this is one of the most stubborn group of people that will blame the fanbase before they admit they did something wrong.  After a huge backlash on one balance patch, people demanded more transparency from the devs. So, what did we get? A brief burst of activity from the game directors on Twitter (which lasted about a month) and some half-hearted explanations buried in the patch notes. But they still sneak in changes without telling anyone. They made a huge change to the matchmaking system that resulted in people not finding any matches. I have been searching for a match, while writing this review and I found a single match with a player more than 5 ranks away from mine.  Bandai as a publisher is also not new to the anti-consumer practices. A $70 game is getting a ""battle-pass"" 2 months into it's release with filler, throwaway cosmetics that were available for free in the previous games.  One of the most knowledge check-heavy characters, Eddy, is a $6 DLC character, which you can't lab against if you don't buy him (can't even take over your own character in the replay).  I'm not the biggest modder but the modding scene is a huge part of the Tekken community. Instead of offering cosmetics that people would actually want to pay for, Namco decided to release laughable garbage and go after the modders just so they could squeeze out as much money as possible from their battlepass.  The balance is a mess (see Dragunov, Azucena etc.) but that could be remedied in the upcoming balance patches (lol).  Ranked is also full of pluggers. Instead of getting an automatic win when your opponent plugs, like in every other game, namco decided that its better to keep an excel spreadsheet of the players reported on twitter and manually issue bans to them every other patch... yeah.  Nobody's talking about this, but one of the main reasons I love tekken and not any other fighting game is because of the quality of character animations. All the moves felt like they had weight to them and looked very fluid. However, since the later Tekken 7 seasons (see Lidya's whole moveset, wallbounce) it has taken a huge dive. Some of the new animations in Tekken 8 are outright terrible (tornado animation, everybody getting a backflip move that make the character look weightless ex. Jin). This all culminated with Eddy that had his whole movelist reworked and now looks like he's sporadically jumping between animations when he does a move (no windup, no recovery, moves worse than an MK character). However, this is the least of the games problems. It looks gorgeous otherwise and devs did a great job. This is my favorite game franchise, which I've been playing since Tekken 3 on PS1 and I hate to see it in its current state, but the only way to get through to namco is to stop giving them more money. At the end of the day all they care about is money and this will keep happening if you keep supporting them with your wallets.  In short, Tekken 8 has potential, but until Bamco get their act together, I'd steer clear of this mess. I know this review will read like Im venting, because I am. Im sad to see this happen to my favorite franchise. There's a reason I have 3000 hours in Tekken 7 and just as many playing it offline with people I've met through this game that I can call my lifelong friends. UPDATE:  The upcoming patch seems to be promising. Obviously overtuned characters are getting nerfed and they seem to be providing a lot of free content for damage control. The game needs a few more of updates like these and it will be in a great state. I will update my review accordingly. UPDATE 2:  They were just weathering the storm. Now that people have quieted down, they release Genmaji Temple stage as a separate DLC, not included in season pass or ultimate edition. This company is a joke UPDATE 3: Clive happened. Update 4: Online is basically unplayable. The netcode is absolutely terrible. I dont think I can play another 8 years of this. Update 5: Season 2 is out. Game is balanced if everyone is a broken top 1. Devs are not listening. I would stay away"
191970507,english,0,1778820,"I've loved Tekken since playing T2 in arcades as a kid. I was never great, but enjoyed long sets with friends. Tekken 8 heat system was rough in Season 1 - it messed with character expression and turned matches into Heat spamming.  But Season 2 is a complete mess. It’s not Tekken anymore, just a button-mashing simulator with no depth.  New players might enjoy it, but veterans are better off waiting for changes or skipping it entirely."
162329251,english,0,1778820,"They Banned Iran ip for no reason!  I paid for this game and i can't even play it without VPN and of course its gonna effect on my ping and i'm receiving lots of hate comments from the community cz my ping is 130 ... that's not fair, i played this franchise since Tekken 2 released and now here I am, I cant play without VPN. thank you so much btw , the characters are not balance anymore and the game is not technical as it was before, you just need more luck!"
163598774,english,0,1778820,"PROS: The game is fun at a casual level and it is an improvement on Tekken 7 in terms of load times, graphics, and single-player content. The story is brief and entertaining and the new characters are unique and well-designed.  CONS: The dev team is convinced that making the game more aggressive and flashy (think eSports) is going to make newcomers and casuals more interested in the Tekken series. Personally, I'm not a fan of the gameplay changes. The new universal mechanic (heat) is basically a way to make the game more like advanced rock-paper-scissors and less about skill and game knowledge. I think that one of the cool things about Tekken is how much depth and skill expression there is to the game and heat is a lazy way to even the playing field. Aside from that, there are a lot of issues with the game that have yet to be resolved. There is still no anti-cheat of any kind. The netcode is quite bad for 2024 unless you're playing with a 4-5 bar wired connection. PC players that can't run the game at 60 fps force their opponents to play in slow motion (there is no minimum benchmark score needed to play online). The ranked system is a total mess and it is clear that the devs designed the ranked system to make it easy for new players to see their rank go up without actually getting better at the game. You can't lab pay to win DLC characters in replay mode unless you own them. They added an incredibly low-effort cosmetics store and battlepass system in a $70 game - you also can't buy anything directly, you have to buy 'Tekken coins' which means to get one $5 skin you'd have to pay $10 to have enough coins. Don't expect these problems to get fixed anytime soon. Overall, even though the game is fun, I would not recommend it. I think it's not worth getting into if there are other fighting games that seem equally appealing to you."
162059122,english,0,1778820,"Someone on the balancing team is a few sandwiches short of a picnic and it's really hurting the game.  I don't even feel it's a matter of ""prioritising casual players"" anymore, it feels like the patch was made by an AI language model trained only on satanic scriptures  I can look past the DLC/MTX scummery, suits are gonna be like that, but even the devs are nuts it turns out.. ahh..."
172467636,english,0,1778820,"This is a game that has simply hurt me too many times. I don't mind strong characters, I really don't. I could get my balls handed to me on a silver platter and still have fun, but that's just the thing. Sometimes, this stuff just ain't fun. Maybe it's just me but as a person who's been playing since Tekken 7, I'll just get to the point, I'm not going to say anything like, ""OH, old Tekken good new Tekken bad"", in fact i really enjoy the heat system and overall aggression. But it feels just, way too mashy? You get so minus to a point where sidestepping is literally not an option, and sidestepping itself is already really tricky to get the hang of yet very rewarding, sometimes however it simply feels impossible and you feel trapped and as a player it sucks. I play Paul, Jin, Kazuya, Leo, Dragonouv, and Devil jin, and I notice that I only do well once I start ""cheesing"" which might mean many things to many different people. So I'll be a bit more blunt and just say what my heart feels as of this moment, writing this review.   Neutral does not exist  At least that what it feels like to me, I don't see a point in doing a heat engager cancel in neutral when i'm gonna end up JUST AS MINUS if I had missed it anyways. Countless times I would think, ""Yes this is a safe distance, I will engage heat to utilize my resource advantage over the enemy. Only for them to just RA in response and magically magnetically gravitate towards me? Perhaps this is just a skill issue on my end but aside from that. Some times you feel extremely boxed in. Characters like King, Lidia, just sorta lock you in and once again, this might be a knowledge check, and I might just be bad but keep in mind I'm like the average purple rank. I have a Tekken King level friend that claims I am Kishin level, yet whenever I try to climb the ranks it just feels impossible? I swear I'd be on a 6 winstreak, lose once, and I'd be where I statred. Became a bit of an inside joke where we'd celeberate our ranks by going  ""Hey guys! I ranked from up from mighty ruler to mighty ruler!""  And I wish this was a joke but occasionally I would throw a demotion game, just so I can repromote and get that boost.   Ranking is messed up Footsies feel off There's no other game like tekken but sometimes it just hurts.  I'm open to any comments but I'm really just not in the mood for any git gud or tips. Too heartbroken for that.  I want to love Tekken but as I kept playing I realised that this is NOT healthy for me. I'd play Tekken with my friends and it'd always end in me going into a complain session. The worst part is that they'd just agree with me. All my complaints about random mid combo sideswaps, input eating, sidesteps turning into jumps and ducks, dropping combos because of wall jank. I wanted to be wrong, I wanted to be told ""Hey, ur just bad, here's a tip on how to overcome this"" But no. I'm sure some of you had those moments, maybe they're a lot more rarer than mine, how knows.   But yeah, I'm writing this, with pain and salt in my mind, having just uninstalled it after being deleted by my buddy playing Lidia and Reina.   Tekken is good game. but it's just not good for ME. So, I'm quitting for now.  Maybe I'll come back after a year or two, or when the heihachi DLC drops.  Maybe then it might feel better.   EDIT 25/9/2024 I recently reinstalled Tekken 8 after seeing heihachi, i got filled with hope and motivation. I joined some ranked matches and immediately get reminded of everything I had complained about in the above statement. Maybe it really is a skill issue, but once more.   Can't sidestep because I get locked in. People would rather mash their way out instead of going for parries and sidesteps or simply blocking and waiting for a gap. Which is fine! IF, it didn't work like 80% of the time.  Neutral? What's that? It's a contest of who can overwhelm the other guy first. Footsies only last for like 5 seconds before somebody, be it me, or the opponent, feels the compelling need to throw out some random heat move.  But compared to before, my head is clearer.   So I have suggestions, some of you might like it, some of you might not.  Ngl, KEEP OFFENCE THE SAME. I honestly think this is the most ""FUN"" Tekken in the same way that Guilty Gear STRIVE is the most ""FUN"" Guilty Gear to the masses.  My only problem is that as a player of both games, Guilty Gear has a more streamlined defence, block high, block low, occasionally try a parry and dust grab.  Tekken? You give me side steps, you give me Highs, Mids and Lows to worry about. You give me not just grabs, but different kinds of grabs from tackles, to feints, each with their own unique uses for repositioning, and unique ways to break them too. You give me power crushes, you give me while standings, all these moves, and I get to use NONE of them because I'm minus 100 and the Reina/Lydia/Lars/Victor/Jun is bullying me with their 50/50s and homing stance locks. Once again, maybe to the better players she's not an issue but wouldn't it be nice to actually be able to sidestep in what is basically the ONLY game worth playing that allows it?  TL:DR, Just buff defence. That's it, the options are there, just give the players more opportunities to use them and honestly the game will feel so much better.   Once again, I am the average purple rank player, I play this game for fun, climbing ranks? Sure it's nice to climb but at the end of the day what everybody wants is some GOOD A$$ TEKKEN. Maybe I'm just too defensive in an offense oriented game, but a majority of my playstyle's strength comes from defence. Maybe that's why I feel so limited?  EDIT 2 AS OF 26/10/2024  This time this is a salt review, THE GAME IS STILL TRASH NOTHING HAS CHANGED PEOPLE CAN JUST GET AWAY WITH SO MUCH FORCED 50/50s I DONT GET IT, I CAN'T SIDESTEP, I CAN'T PUNISH AFTER A SUCCESSFUL SIDESTEP (Though I skill issue on my part, I'm talking about the moves that just send the characters flying so far i.e. dragonouv smash) BACK TURN COMBOS ON THE ON THE WALL ARE STILL BEYOND JANK)   is this Tekken or is this 3d Strive man? Because if that's what your going for, Strive executes the aggression idea WAY BETTER.  You are NOT rewarded for having good defense in this game! (Typed this after losing to a sidestep stance spam jun and Victor with that lanky af CH launcher sweep)  Stuff needs to be more minus on whiff so people can't just throw stuff out willy nilly, that or make it so that sidesteps actually work, I swear, in one ranked session alone I have encountered FIVE SITUATIONS where I have sidestepped so hard, that I swapped sides with the opponent, ONLY TO GET HIT ANYWAYS?????  Good news tho, I reached Blue rank (it's the same issue there too...)  Also, I want characters that are hard to play because they require SKILL to use, not characters that are hard to play because they SUCK. Bamco wtf are you smoking with that DLC money bro.......  Edit fir 26/1/2024 Hey guys, I reached blue rank with 3 characters, Jin Paul, And Heihachi, and I'll be honest. Things haven't changed. My blue rank friend is now a Tekken Emperor and even he still agrees it's sort of the same up there in ramks, that is, mashfest. I've improved as a player and have come to realise that it's not neccessarily the characters in this game that are busted and moreso the game itself being busted. That is all.   Blah blah Defense should be buffed, blah blah 50/50 spamfest you know how it goes.  I do have one new complaint though, some characters just seem to have the weirdest autotracking stuff. You'd sidestep something flawlessly and still magically get hit by the second part of the move as they magically lock onto you.   As riduculous as it sounds, Armoured Core 6 (Another game I have been playing) Is a better and more fun fighting game than Tekken, and it's not even remotely close to a fighting game. Weird.  I'm not even writing this update with salt, I've gotten past the salt and reached the point where I'm just empty?  SEASON2... KMS"
192092168,english,0,1778820,"This prolonged April fools joke is getting a bit annoying, can we get the real season 2 patch now?  On a real note, this patch is the most out of touch thing I have seen in any game that I have ever played. What a great ""Defensive"" patch. This new era of Tekken is so void of character archetypes it's actually crazy. Every character is now a brain dead 50/50 stance character with homing plus frames mids and crazy lows.   Every character utilises the system mechanics exactly the same way. We got heat engage into crouch so of course every character needs a crazy full crouch low to be able to take advantage of that, right?  I don't know if this is fixable and at this point I kinda hope Tekken as a series dies, because Bandai Namco does not deserve more money. Let's hope another 3D fighter gets released that can replace Tekken."

It’s essential to take the art of Tekken seriously for self-improvement, and I’m beginning to question if this game’s current state supports that goal.  I’m not pleased with how this change has affected my character and the game overall. It feels as if I’m being pushed into a play style that doesn’t align with my approach. This patch has been incredibly frustrating and needs urgent attention. Despite all my hard work—practicing, studying my opponents, and analyzing gameplay—it all seems to lose meaning when I’m forced to eat unearned 50/50's and adopt a style more suited to a BlazeBlue character. Losing the essence of my character is something I cannot accept. At this point, I barely recognize who I’m playing and what I'm playing anymore...

191713020,english,0,1778820,I dunno man. This game increasingly favors the aggressive style of play and rewards the player for it. more 50/50 gets added to the game and defense feels worse every match.  I dunno why it is such a good feeling for players to framelock someone until their HP bar hits zero. Especially problematic in heat where you just block and pray to not die.   The best defense is offense here which destroys the punishment aspect of the game. I don't even feel like my opponent is reacting to my stuff. They are not thinking about what i'm doing they just force their offense on me and hope i didnt lab every DLC character.

I cannot recommend this game though, because of the despicable MTX practices they have decided to implement AFTER reviews were in. i believe buying costumes is an ok way to try to have fans continue to support the developers (as long as base game customization is great) EXCEPT when you CANNOT buy them directly and instead need to buy a premium in-game currency, as it can (and does) lead to overpaying/overspending. And now they have decided to introduce a battlepass which i believe is completely unnecessary, and another way to try to squeeze money out of players through FOMO. Overall this game is crazy fun and if you can ignore the MTX then please go ahead and buy it if that's what you want to do, but if you're on the fence and unsure whether you'd like it even after trying the demo, i would suggest not buying it to not support these greedy and anti-consumer practices."

191694778,english,0,1778820,"First time i post a review ever because i am baffled, i never seen devs so out of touch with the community...  New season dropped and they made every character into a braindead easy mix up machine without a single buff to defense, from the start of tekken 8 players where vocal about the prominess of easy mix ups and the glaring nerfs to defense compared to past tekken games and yet they do a huge patch with lots of new moves that enphasis on every aspect the players disliked about the game.  No one litterally no one asked for these changes, even new players never asked for more offense in a game that clearly lacks defensive options and is easy to mash button and win like in most Tekken games.  Tekken especially with competetive Tekken 7 scene garnered a reputation of a game that has solid focus on fundamental skill such as movement, neutral and defense and seeing how Tekken 8 nerfed all this aspects is sad, even the tournament views are worse for T8 compared to T7 for how homoginized the characters are and streamlined the gameplay is with new systems.  But i still had hope since things could change for the better. however devs turning a deaf ear on their community that was extremly vocal about all te negative aspects of the game which made the experience worse just to double down on what everyone hates for some fabricated notion that ""it's good for new players"" is incomprehensible when people loved Tekken 7 which was massively succesful for a fighting game."
191720018,english,0,1778820,"I do not recommend Tekken 8 season 2 for these reasons.  -The developers do not understand the characters they design. They see that the character has strengths and weaknesses and continue to not let them have this weakness. Instead, they homogenize the character to be like the others making them overtuned. This was a big issue in Season 1 that made 70% of the roster oppressive. And the game is suppose to favor the aggressor, but it favored the aggressor too much to the point where it will look like a one player game sometimes. There is very little counterplay to these characters. =Season 2 did not address these things, they only made minor defensive changes like being able to side step from crouch and side step buffer. But that is not enough as they decided to buff almost everyone while giving them major/minor nerfs. However, this isn't the only thing that makes it bad. They also killed character identities like Law's WS4 CH DSS not being a thing anymore, Zafina stances, Feng Wei snake dash block, etc. They gave characters like Dragunov some more identity which is cool, but no character should have their identity being killed or overtuned. All they did was buff the weaknesses of each character instead of just letting them have this weakness and just buff their strength instead. But the developers do not understand their character designs. -The developers also did not address any of the dumb tracking some of the moves have like the heat bursts. Yes, some of the Heat bursts like Bryans still track even though they aren't suppose to.  Also removing CH Ki charge is the worse change I've ever seen. No one complained about it and people liked it."

All of this is being included in a game that's plagued with many other issues that need urgent fixing, like wonky netcode, terrible balance and no real penalties for cheaters/rage quitters.

191130721,english,0,1778820,"""For Season 2, we'd like to focus on defense in terms of the lateral aspects of a 3d fighting game.""   Followed by the developers spending over two hours without mentioning any defensive changes and only focusing on more BS 50/50 casino gameplay is hilarious.   Oh right, some genius decided that you should be punished for breaking a throw correctly and take chip damage.   Would not recommend anyone purchasing this game until they actually improve defense/movement to counteract the constant aggression.   [b]EDIT:[/b] Just wanted to add some extra feedback in case the developers become truthful when it comes to taking feedback.  1. Remove Chip Damage completely: Its a garbage mechanic and makes being on the receiving end of heat even more frustrating because even if you block the mix-ups correctly you're still punished enough to where you'll often lose 40% of your life bar from just chip damage and be put in range to where the next mix up will kill you.  2. Buff Movement: Backdash needs to be buffed to bait and create whiffs otherwise Tekken turns into everyone just constant throwing out hitboxes without thinking knowing that at worst they will hit on block and often times be plus still. Sidesteps need tuning to be more reliable since they can fail even if using them in the same situation as one in which they've succeeded previously.  3. Fix Phantom hitboxes/Nerf range of moves/Nerf homing moves/Remove string realignment GLOBALLY: All of these changes will also help with the problem above. People would play a lot slower in neutral which builds tension, makes a defensive more viable and allows there to be more neutral interactions instead of each player trying to bulldoze their way into constantly being in close range forcing a guessing game.  4.Severely nerf heat: I would love to just remove it completely but its already built into the core Tekken system. Instead just make it so that heat is something you have to earn in a game and make it so that once you activate it the meter never stops going down. Remove the ability to regenerate heat from moves/stances. Nerf Heat smashes across the board so that they don't cause stage interactions or wall splat. Heat smashes being so overbearingly strong streamlines a lot of the game play especially against characters like Jin/Heihachi. I would make every heat smash +3 or less on block since even when you block such powerful moves correctly you have to guess again for your life with another unfair mix-up.  5.Lower the plus frames on moves across the board, +5 is crazy for heat dash considering its not even something you have to earn to be able to do when you have heat active. There are also too many high reward moves that are also +6 on block or higher... Why?  6. Remove Unbreakable grabs and guard breaks from the game. They are just way too powerful and mentally taxing to deal with. Guard breaks also often lead to wall splats or wall blasts which makes them low risk for too high of a reward."
191738401,english,0,1778820,"To preface this - it's currently the launch of season 2 of Tekken 8. I like Tekken, I've played Tekken since Tekken 2. I've played every Tekken game to date. I like this franchise so much that I've spent energy following it and playing it over the course of my life.  This game is quite possibly the worst Tekken game I have ever played. I would consider Death by Degrees to be more true to form to Tekken's formula and aesthetic than this game.   You can see right now I have hundreds of hours in this game, you might be asking why? If you don't like it - why spend so much time. Here's why - I have desperately tried to cling onto the idea that if I played enough/ranked up enough it would suddenly click. I've also always liked Tekken and didn't want to drop a franchise I've historically enjoyed so I thought I was missing something.  I wasn't and that point has been proven now.  Tekken 8 was given out to players initially as a review copy without a battle pass addition. Once official release came around a battle pass was added to bypass the review phase. This battle pass and each one afterwards till now contains items which were normally obtained in Tekken games through in-game currency obtained from Online Matches or Arcade mode or even other party modes added in previous games such as Tekken Bowling or Tekken Volleyball.  However with Tekken 8 this was a unwelcome surprise and now it requires real world money.  This is why Tekken 8 now has a asterisk with the message ""This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity"".  This is not one of those times.  With the launch of season 2 they emphasised that the updates would favour defence options a bit more. Currently plus frames are rampant with many moves or heat activations which leave no room at all for you to retaliate and certain characters are utterly broken. I don't mean overpowered either but they have them too.  Paul can currently do f,1+2 into while standing 3 and it will bypass the guarding system and hit every time. To go even further, he can press 2 after that unblockable ws,3 and if you're at the wall, you just got wall splat. Which will possibly lead to you losing the match because you anticipated the move coming and blocked like a normal sane individual (You shouldn't have done that).  There is a plethora of similar issues with the game right now. There are many reasons the game is in the state that it is in but it comes to who's currently in charge. This narrows down to Kouhei Ikeda now being game director and Harada becoming an adviser. All ""heat"" on this issue is directed towards Harada who is sun setting his time with Tekken. All positive notes to take from T8 will be accredited to Ikeda's work on the game. All drawbacks will be learned from for the next game hopefully but ultimately it's Ikeda's series now. Many Soul Calibur developers have transitioned to Tekkens development.  That is the state of Tekken 8's development right now.  There is a bunch of issues why the game is not good right now: Too many plus frames. No actual defensive options. Terrible Heat mechanic. Many moves hitting off axis. Combo damage is incredibly high. Too many stance transitions (Everyone is Lei now apparently). Stock/State Power ups. Chip Damage.  The aesthetic of the previous games' are also lost entirely. T4 still holds the bar for the best with so little to show for it. They only needed a hint of flashy stuff or ridiculous concepts in Tekken. If you look at Clive you can see that's been thrown out the window.  What's also really disappointing is that a lot of players have tried putting the thought into peoples head that previous Tekken games were worse and they don't have the stomach to actually say the series got worse.  It's a really funny twist of fate that Tekken Tag Tournament 2 didn't kill Tekken but Tekken 8 - their most lavish and expensive title to date is doing a better job than Tag 2 ever did."

They don't release normal patches, instead they release shi#ty DLC with characters that have nothing to do with Tekken and they're broken, we were promised that characters that have nothing to do with Tekken wouldn't appear there. Cheaters are still the same, both low ranked and high ranked, the search system is still the same crappy system where it can take 20-30 minutes to find an opponent.

But despite all this banco will release a collaboration with nike and make limited edition watches instead of good patches, congratulations, this is the worst fighting game ever.

Они не выпускают нормальных патчей, вместо этого они выпускают дерьмовые DLC с персонажами, которые не имеют ничего общего с Tekken, и они сломаны, нам обещали, что персонажи, которые не имеют ничего общего с Tekken, там не появятся. Читеры все те же остались, как на низкоранговых, так и на высокоранговых, система поиска все та же дерьмовая, где поиск соперника может занять 20-30 минут. Противники, которые кликают куда угодно и бьют чем угодно с защитой 30-40, просто отвратительны. Противник, который может ударить по воздуху и магическим образом попасть по вам, и при этом нанести контр-удар, даже если вы находитесь у него за спиной) Не нормально развитая система сайдстепов, где вы также можете получить удар от противника, который должен был промахнуться по вам, но увы, противник ударив по тому же воздуху может попасть по вам.   Но несмотря на все это banco выпустит коллаборацию с nike и сделает лимитированные часы вместо хороших патчей, поздравляю, это худший файтинг в истории. Единственное, что в нем хорошо - это графика.

This patch is a complete disaster that destroys the very essence of the game.  A chaotic gameplay experience The developers have completely shattered the game’s balance by making offense far too powerful. The game has turned into a mindless rushdown fest where defense, once a core pillar of the series, has become unnecessarily difficult. Reacting now requires an absurd mix of inhuman reflexes, encyclopedic knowledge, and lightning-fast analysis. Even worse, the game has become a never-ending lottery, a simple rock-paper-scissors match where luck outweighs technical skill. Every interaction feels like a gamble, making the experience frustrating and unbearable.  A disastrous development direction The decision to bring in SoulCalibur developers was a fatal mistake. Tekken is not SoulCalibur, and trying to force mechanics from a completely different game into Tekken’s system betrays the very DNA of the franchise. Harada and his team seem to have lost sight of what made Tekken a true fighting game masterpiece.  An outrageous price tag As if things weren’t bad enough, Bandai Namco is charging €40 for this mess! This price is absolutely ridiculous for a patch that turns Tekken into a game of pure luck. At this rate, I’d rather spend my money at the slot machines at the carnival—at least there, I know I’m gambling from the start.  An ultimatum for Tekken If this patch isn’t fixed soon, I’m done with Tekken. This is no longer the game I’ve known and loved for three decades. In its current state, it’s unplayable and no longer worth my time.  Bandai Namco, fix this before it’s too late!"

But there is a big problem, you can't use the DLC characters in training, and you are unable to view the replays of a match against a DLC character (if you don't own the character). You legitimately have to PAY to learn the matchups against these characters, which is honestly disgusting. I don't really care about the tekken coins stuff because all you can do is buy cosmetics with them, so that doesn't really bother me, but it is really scummy to add ""V-Bucks"" to a $90 CDN game a few months after launch.

It was weird when the characters talk each other in different languages. How do they understand each other in different languages? The arcade story was fine. The character stories was fine, it just beat 5 opponents to get a cinematic cutscenes. Some of few characters do have a funny cinematic cutscenes. The gameplay is great. I do like the combat system in this game. The combat animations were fast and smooth, making every fight feel incredibly dynamic. It's different from Tekken 7 like the heat system wasn't in older Tekken games. The graphics and the character models were stunning. The music in this game was so good and banger.

I am a Tekken veteran and I can assure you: This game is close to Guilty Gear Strive than Tekken 7/6 etc.  With the new S2 patch now every character got buffed, from an already to bloated and crazy standard. Basically everyone upgraded from a machine gun to a tactical nuke. The game is and will be so pressure and 50/50 focused, that you won't have fun as a defender.  Legacy stuff, like ki-charge and manual teching (backroll tech) have been removed, completely altering the gameplay and simplefying it.  As a through-and-through Tekken fan:  THIS GAME WILL MAKE ME DROP IT IN THE NEXT 7 DAYS! I urge every Tekken fan to give a negative review and minimize gameplay in order to give them a heavy hit, otherwise things won't change.  I hope I can prevent any old Tekken Fan from buying this game. It isn't worth it; at most as a casual and even then you won't have fun being stomped by your opponents.  Do better Team Tekken!"

173335493,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8, while undeniably more accessible than its predecessors, has stripped away much of the tactical depth that defined the series. The game feels like it's been simplified to cater to a larger player base, but at the cost of what made Tekken unique. What we're left with is a game that's largely about 50/50 situations, with little room for the nuanced, defensive play that even 2D fighting games manage to preserve.  One of the biggest disappointments for me is how defense is not only unrewarded but outright punished, particularly with the introduction of chip damage. In other fighting games, there are defensive tools to counterbalance aggressive play, but in Tekken 8, it feels like the game is designed to reward the player who can memorize the best combos and apply pressure non-stop. The Ranked matches exacerbate this issue, becoming a toxic experience where opponents either quit after one match, have unbearable lag, or exhibit other frustrating behaviors.  After over 100 hours of trying to give this game a chance, I've lost the drive to continue. I might revisit it if Kunimitsu is reintroduced, but for now, Tekken 8 is getting uninstalled. I'm finding more satisfaction in games like Guilty Gear Strive or Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, where my efforts in practicing hit confirms are actually rewarded, unlike in Tekken 8, where any attempt at analysis seems to get me punished anyway.  The final straw for me is the Battle Pass system, which feels even more intrusive and unpleasant in Tekken 8 than in Rising. It's a feature I genuinely dislike and it only adds to my overall disappointment with the game."
157756742,english,1,1778820,"[b]Tekken 8, the latest installment in the iconic fighting game franchise developed by Bandai Namco, continues to redefine the genre with its polished gameplay, stunning visuals, and diverse roster of characters. I am going to go into detail about this:[/b] [list] [*][b]Stunning Visuals and Immersive Environments:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 screams breathtaking graphics and brilliantly designed environments that put players in dynamic and vibrant battle arenas. From bustling city streets to serene natural landscapes and from there to Nightmare realities, each stage is a visual spectacle, enhancing the overall gaming experience.[/i]  [*][b]Refined Gameplay Mechanics:[/b] [i]Building upon its previous installments, Tekken 8 introduces refined gameplay mechanics that offer a perfect balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for Tekken Pros. The controls are responsive and creative, allowing players to execute complex combos and special moves with precision. I can also add executing combos that are just frames, are much more easily executable now.[/i]  [*][b]Diverse Roster of Characters:[/b] [i]With a diverse roster of characters, each with their own unique fighting style and backstory, Tekken 8 offers something for every player. From classic favorites like Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama to newcomers with innovative fighting techniques like Azucena and Victor, the character selection is vast and varied, and rumored to be becoming bigger and bigger in the coming years.[/i]  [*][b]Engaging Story Mode:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 features an engaging story mode that delves deeper into the rich lore of the Tekken universe. Players embark on a thrilling journey filled with intrigue, betrayal, and epic showdowns, unraveling the mysteries behind each character's motives, with the main story just based on the Mishima Bloodline.[/i]  [*][b]Robust Online Multiplayer:[/b] [i]The online multiplayer feature of Tekken 8 delivers an exhilarating experience, allowing players to test their skills against opponents from around the world. With robust matchmaking features and various online modes, including ranked matches and tournaments, the competitive scene is vibrant and engaging, the net-code is not perfect but its way better than the Tekken 7 when it came out back in the days. [/i]   [*][b]Customization Options:[/b] [i]Tekken 8 offers extensive customization options, allowing players to personalize their favorite characters with unique costumes, accessories, and cosmetic items. Also paying homage to other characters from the games like Resident Evil with adding their customized costumes in the game. From traditional martial arts attire to outlandish outfits, the customization options are virtually limitless, adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, so that my character may look cool while Kicking A$$.[/i] [/list]  [b][i]In the end I would like to add that Tekken 8 surpasses expectations as a fighting game masterpiece, combining stunning visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, with new Game Modes and a diverse cast of characters to deliver an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or new to the franchise, Tekken 8 offers something for everyone and cements its place as one of the finest fighting games of all time. I would recommend highly to anyone and to anybody who is into fighting games or not, as this will hook them up.[/i][/b]"

169651406,english,0,1778820,"There will be always be 50/50s in fighting games, but the keyword here is 'forced'—forced by the universal mechanic, not by the unique characters or player agency over them. When you factor in those heat interactions over all the sets, it becomes a core mechanic that decides the outcome of the match. It's as if it 'fills the entire game,' like an anchor point, and the characters' unique styles and stances take a back seat. The matches are way too fast and aggresive for any deliberate play.  Bottom line is, I hate the heat mechanic itself and want it gone. Heat engagers break momentum (like those long goddamn rage arts were not enough), push the other player to the wall, and force you to guess. Yes, it gives you a chance to redeem a mistake, but it's like the game is forcing me to play a certain way that I never asked for. I also have to use my heat, be aggressive, and win that one interaction or avoid losing to it, or the other player will force me to the wall. This was not the case in T7, as you could only do that with good reads and combo execution, not absurd pushbacks. T7 was also very good in terms of balance in season 5. Yes devs are 'fixing' the game but the game itself is the problem. They just want the fights to look good on streams and tournaments; hence heat, but they killed defense now there's no  turtle syle , baiting etc you just cant do it and there's no incentives its just mash mash heat engager  heat smash  forward momentum mash mash. I play when I can but I don't enjoy it as much as tekken 7, strangely it doesnt even feel good to win as its more mentally draining than fun imo. Maybe that just me idk."

176364038,english,0,1778820,"Probably the easiest and most aggressive entry in the series, Tekken 8 has solid features but is marred by scummy monetization policies. It feels like I'm playing a free-to-play, gacha game anytime there is a new update. Miss the latest DLC character? The main menu will remind you constantly of their presence, with the in-game store taking priority over the ""real"" menu, forcing you to navigate around it. This is unfortunate in a cheaper game, but understandable. It's unforgivable when the base cost is 70 USD, and another 40 for a ""character pass"" that includes 4 characters and nothing else.   More concerning is the way Bandai Namco handled this. The Tekken Team has always said one thing and done another regarding these policies. Murray and Harada were on record saying there would be no in-game store, battle pass, or loot boxes. But without fail, all of these things have come to pass. The only caveat is potentially the loot boxes -- the asset is currently being used to advertise bundled costume packages -- but give it time. Recently, Heihachi's stage was sold separately from his DLC -- a departure from Tekken 7's season pass, and the community has been up-in-arms over this. But I feel the Heihachi stage drama is  just a figurehead for a larger discontent that the community feels over constantly being asked to pay more and more for things that used to be free.   The game needs a change in direction ala No Man's Sky at this point to right the ship. There's too much negativity surrounding it, and Bandai Namco need to re-establish good will with their players. That's the only apology worth anything."
191694070,english,0,1778820,"Ill start off by saying i love Tekken and i don't want to see it fail. That being said if you are someone who, like me wanted to pick up Tekken because you saw the intricate movement, whiff punishment and defensive prowess of JDCR and you wanted to work towards that level then i have bad news for you. That is not this game. Tekken 8 went in a different direction, once you get past all the knowledge checks what you are left with in this game is an overabundance of canned mixups, oppressive frames and in general very few options to move around in 3 dimensions or play defensively. This isn't coming from a jaded legacy player either, my first Tekken was Tekken 7 and i have to say Tekken 8 has mostly moved away from what made me fall in love with it in the first place.  TLDR: I don't think this game is worth taking seriously as a competitive game. If you just wanna play it for shits casually it will probably be fun."
185237105,english,0,1778820,"Gameplay wise, it's nothing compared to previous Tekken games, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's designed to be more accessible, which is good, but the price for casual interest is very high. It's just a completely different game—one that rewards mindless offense and punishes defensive play styles, forcing players to just run at each other all the time.  If you're to play this game, understand that you'll get tons of games where you'll lose 70+% of your HP not because you played poorly, but simply because you guessed incorrectly. If someone with 5 hours can luck into a win against a higher-ranked player simply because that player guessed incorrectly, then we have a problem. Also understand that this version of Tekken is no longer a martial arts fighting game—expect to see and fight against guns, laser beams, dragons, Ifrit, and a lot more anime-looking stuff. If you just want down-to-earth martial arts, then maybe just wait for the new VF game 🤷🏽.  And oh, I'm not even gonna talk about the whole DLC mess (releasing the shop months after release to avoid bad reviews, putting legacy characters (and a stage) behind a paywall, etc. There's already a lot of reviews about that, here and on other platforms."
191850184,english,0,1778820,"As a player with over 3500 hours in Tekken 7 I was very excited to see what the next entry in the series would be. My review is being written as of Day 3 of Season 2.  [h2] Network and PC performance [/h2] When the game released on PC it still had performance and network issues that were reported in the network test. As a user with a custom build machine that is tuned well and can play all the latest games on highest settings Tekken 8 still has performance issues at times. Every time I am on the character select screen the game will become slightly choppy when swapping and selecting characters. The game can sometimes crash on PC. Users that played Tekken 7 on PC will remember if you would alt tab there was a chance the game would crash. This is still on ongoing issue with Tekken 8.  Regarding net code issues, it still feels like Tekken 7 season 4. I am not a developer so I do not know what can be done to improve the net code but it is sad to see a fighting game release in the year that it did (2024) and have such poor net code when other titles like street fighter 6 and guilty gear strive have phenomenal roll back net code.   [h2] Presentation + content [/h2] The costume redesigns the characters received are a warm welcome and do a lot for the returning cast. The music and stages in the game are brilliant. Tekken 8 honestly has one of my favourite soundtracks in the series. I was really looking forward to the story mode as I was invested in seeing what happened after the ending of Tekken 7. The story mode was brilliant and is easily my favourite one iv played in a fighting game. Hopefully we can see a big follow up during a DLC release for Tekken 8.  Customisation is cool and I hope it continues to see free updates over time. The jukebox features is something I always wanted for PC users so it's nice to see us finally get it after missing out on it being a PS4 exclusive for Tekken 7.  I do wish there was more game modes available to play. For example having Team battle come back from the older entries would be really fun for offline play with friends or online in private lobbies.  [h2] Gameplay [/h2] This entry is very rewarding for aggressive play. The new heat system promotes players to stay on the offensive rather than  using movement and blocking to counter play their opponent.  With the new chip system you are punished for blocking and trying to play slowly to get into a better position. This is a huge change in the direction from the previous entry (Tekken 7) where you could use that games movement system to block and take your time to get out of situations. Since Tekken Tag tournament 1 (1999) players have been using movement (Korean back dash cancelling + sidestepping) to avoid these guessing situations and create whiff opportunities however with Tekken 8 having nerfed movement  (With season 2 they have buffed side steps which is nice but back dash cancelling still feels horrible) you will find yourself at times being forced to guess on a 50/50.  I think some of the hit effects are too much. When Clive activates heat and starts doing through his moves it really takes away from the fight and is too distracting.   Every member of the roster got some new tools coming into Tekken 8.  Characters have new single hit and combo strings to change how their game play looks and feels. Some users may find characters play vastly different than their previous entries (Jack-8) is a great example of this.  I think it is important that characters feel unique and have clear defined strengths and weaknesses. I am unsure what approach the developer team are taking with Tekken 8. But it feels to me that characters are starting to feel similar and lose their identity which is a first for a series that has so many unique and interesting characters. Take King for example. Does he need to have the best counter hit string in the game (DF+2,1) which you can hit confirm for a full combo? This does not make sense to me. As a wrestler type character he should be more focused on doing big single hits and using his cool chain throws.   There are currently 14 characters in the game with the guard break mechanic (Bryan, Clive, Devil Jin, Feng, Heihachi, jack, Kuma, Lidia, Panda, Paul, Reina, Shaheen, Steve, Yoshimitsu) which will break through your block and guarantee a follow up vs you.  In Tekkn 7 only two characters had this functionality (Lidia and Fahkumram) with Bryan also has a unique version of this mechanic since Tekken 3 (Taunt). Seeing it become such a normal part of the game really has made it no longer feel special.   With the latest update to the game (Season 2) we were expecting the developers to tone down how aggressive the game is and show us what defensive options they were working on. Since the latest patch characters across the board have become even stronger and more oppressive. More characters have access to 100+ dmg combos without rage and new tools to force you to block and guess on a 50/50 as you cannot use movement to escape situations. Chip damage is still a massive issue and heat lasts for too long when activated.  There are also currently some game breaking bugs from characters such as jack and Paul that have new moves that seem to have slipped past testing and are causing interactions that were not intended. It being only day 3 of season 2 more bugs could be found in the coming days/weeks. Hopefully we get an emergency patch to fix them.  [h2] Closing thoughts [/h2]  I am not sure what the future holds for the game.    I feel like Bandai Namco have been developing Tekken 8 to be enjoyable for the user on the attack without thinking how does it feel to be the user on the defending side.  Just because being on the offensive feels good doesn't mean being on the defending side has to feel bad. But with the core systems in place for Tekken 8 that is exactly how the game feels. From speaking with casual and pro players it does not seem that either group is happy with the direction the game is going.   I think the developers have lost sight of what made Tekken so much fun. It wasn't big flashy hit effects, over powered moves, characters having no defined weaknesses.  [list] [*] It was the unique characters and their specifics strengths. [*] It was seeing someone put years into a character and mastering what their specific game plan was and aspiring to be that great. [*] It was being a new player and seeing a clip of someone moving around the screen fast thinking ""Wow how are they moving like that??"". [*] It was the people who took the time out of their day to host online and offline events just for people to show up and play their favourite fighting game. [*] It was seeing people coming together from different countries to compete and change their lives [/list]  [b] It was the community.[/b]  And right now it feels like the developers are no longer listening to the community.  You can do as many collaborations and have as many guest characters as you want. If no one is around to play the game who will purchase the future dlcs you make?  I am lucky enough that I have a healthy offline scene of cool people who play for fun and want to improve. I hope the developers can open up a bit more with the community and maybe reach out for more feedback on future patches or ideas they have.  Everybody who purchased Tekken 8 loves the series. We just want to see it go in a different direction than the current one.  All the best   o/"

UDATE#2: Added Note as of 6/4/24:   BATTLE PASS ROUND 1 has ended and literally nothing replaced it. Menus are missing or empty. I did not buy it and frankly don't care- But I want people scoping these reviews to see that in a $70 game, Namco is late on a seamless Battle Pass for this ""Live Service"" Game.   Absolutely hilarious.   The hits keeps coming!  UPDATE #3 7/21/2024: They did it- Namco really did.   They added in-game advertisements to a stage for NIKE shoes... Namco just spent an HOUR at a panel discussing Nike Foamposite Tekken shoes and the BOX they come in... at EVO?! WTF!  Nike is historically known for Sweatshops and ruining communities in 3rd world countries. Why put this in the game? GREED STRIKES AGAIN!  Chipotle too!?   You know, the restaurant chain that is mainly in the US? Yeah- You can earn in-game content by beating King in the battle lounge starting 7/23. This game and all of the additions to it are not for the community or for the playerbase- It seems to be all for Ads, selling stuff that has little to do with the playerbase and is prioritized to make money for Namco.   I already paid $70. So did you (or even more).   Please don't support this. If you love Tekken- don't take this lying down. It will continue to get worse as Namco uses these scummy and dishonest tactics to squeeze as much money and profit as possible... Namco is using these moments to test what they can get away with.

Players expected the stage to be included. It was never announced i would be paid content. Lidia's stage was free...   LOL Original Post (because it continues to evolve)  I am sad about the MTXs and the lazy, absolutely disgusting reused assets from Tekken 7 filling their introductory Battle Pass. These items were held back from launch on purpose just to be dumped in this battle pass. If they are not from Tekken 7- take a look at Tekken Tag 2... Again, reused assets.  These scummy MTXs and Battle Pass were purposefully not discussed before launch and was added 2 months after launch- to sidestep reviews and negative reports. Don't let NAMCO ignore us or move on from this.  This is not Tekken.  This is an example of creating a problem purposefully and selling the solution.   DLC characters if not purchased cannot be labbed against in 10 second drop-in battle replays- a  feature advertised and promoted before launch and in the base-game before MTXs and DLC  were announced or released. Why?    Why is an UNREAL and Blender BALL asset (you can't even defend this Namco) being an item on the battle pass? This has got to be one of the scummiest and laziest battle passes I have ever seen in a game period- And it was  $70 on top of that. NAMCO should be ashamed! To put it in perspective- this ball can be added into UE by making 4-6 clicks.  I know why...

Truly disgusting behavior, and something many people seemed okay with, which wasn't surprising given how soft the gaming community has become regarding this type of stuff. I asked Valve to refund my purchase, because this was not something I wanted to support, and I was denied due to [i]""more than 2 hours played and 14 days passed since purchase.""[/i] Let's just ignore the publisher knowingly misleading their players, and changing the [i]ESRB[/i] rating later to include those succulent words we all crave to hear, [i]""In-game purchases.""[/i]  But [i]Bandai[/i] is a double G—[b]greedy[/b] and [b]glutenous[/b].

But it's the motion of the ocean that counts! And, oh boy, [b]did it rock my boat![/b] The 26th just couldn't come soon enough.  The gameplay shocked me by how easily I jelled with it. Fast, flashy, and furious, yet it was welcoming to a complete noob like myself. I was loving the learning process, and it didn't feel overwhelming. I even managed to get gud at doing some simple combos and air juggling, so that's nice. And I love the new gameplay addition—the [b]Heat[/b] system. Being able to stop my opponent's attack flow by using the [b]Heat Burst[/b] attack, which is uninterruptible, is music to my ears. Sure, you can easily block it, but this is where the fun begins—[b]trying to time it, [i]just right![/i][/b] Plus, the [b]Heat Engager[/b] and [b]Heat Smash[/b] [i](I do be engaging in smashing)[/i] attacks can be used to extend combos and deal even more damage in the process. Simply majestic. The trade-off is that [b]Heat[/b] only lasts 15 seconds. But do you really need more than that? Sometimes less is more, you know.  Speaking of cool attacks, [b]Rage Art[/b] is present once again. This is essentially a super funky high-damage special move you can only do when your health is low. I can't count the number of times using it saved my noob behind from dying. And I gotta say, they are always a treat to watch. [b]This superbly animated sequence, combined with the game's insane visuals, sparks joy each and every time I watch one play out.[/b]  And all the fighting is [i]extra[/i] spiced up by the crazy amount of special effects on the screen each punch, kick, grab, or flying leg kick thrown produces. I can't explain why, but I love the sight of them. [b]It makes watching the punch land that much more oh-so-satisfying.[/b] The animations are also fantastic, further adding to the amazing feel of the combat.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260998 The visuals are simply insane. [i][b]Unreal Engine 5[/b][/i] shines, and so do daddy Kazuya's massive [i]pecs[/i]! Everything, from the arenas, some with multiple rooms you can blast your opponent into, to the character design, is superb and extremely rich in detail. Just amazing stuff. But there's one complaint from me—[b]Paul lost his iconic hair and looks like a Karen[/b] (why [i]Bamco?[/i]).   Also, if you enjoy character customization as much as I do (a lot), then the Arcade Quest mode will be your wet dream. Here, all bets are off, and we'll get free reign over how our fighters look. Will they look wacky? Yes. Creepy? Also yes. Lewd? [b]Hopefully.[/b] Giving players more customization options and freedom is always a plus in my book!  Lastly, the over-the-topness of the story seems to be intact.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260668 I can't wait to see what one of gaming's most dysfunctional families, the Mishimas, is up to. Likely a lot of half-naked men fighting each other, preferably near a cliff, volcano, or maybe a cliff overlooking a volcano. We shall see.  Simply put, [b]it's all (gonna be) perfect![/b]  And after having written 99 reviews, my 100th review will be the first and last [i]improper[/i] one. But [i]Tekken 8[/i] deserved this sacrifice, as it reignited my passion for gaming when no other game could.  So, thank you, [i]Tekken 8.[/i] Thank you to all the developers who poured their hearts and souls into this game. Lastly, thanks to all of you, top bananas, for coming to my [b]TEK[/b]talk. I hope you all enjoy [i]Tekken 8[/i] as much as I am.

168337995,english,0,1778820,"Despite all the 5 balance patches, the game is a complete mess. Granted it is better than it was at launch, but the amount of busted op moves is still insane. So few characters have well defined strengths and weakness. Its just a case of find your 3 op moves on that character, spam the crap out of them. Defence does not matter anymore, side stepping is so weak, so many moves have insane plus frames and give 100% follow ups. I loved t7, and was so excited for t8 but this game isnt fun. I can count the amount of good enjoyable fights on one hand. In 88 hours, thats a joke."

Not only it respects it's audience, It's also an improvement over it's predecessor in every single way and stands alongside 3 as the best game in the series.   Not enough people praising how a game that looks this good is running this well as well. I don't think I've seen many games look as stylish and as beautiful as this game does. The movements and combos are meaty, the sounds are punchy and give feedback, a real technical marvel.  I only wished there were more unlockables like the old school entries, it would feel much better unlocking the characters as you finish stuff as it also would give you an incentive to play more on the down times and to give more meaning to complete other modes. The online functionality is working perfectly, had absolutely no problems playing against strangers and friends alike, except for getting my butt kicked, but that's a granted.

192049829,english,0,1778820,"💀 1,100+ hours to end up with season 2. I've played this game almost every day since release. I loved Tekken 8. It wasn’t perfect, but it felt like high speed chess especially for someone new to fighting games. Now? It's overly aggressive, and most matches feel like coin flips thanks to constant 50/50s.  -Damage is completely out of control  -Pressure is nonstop. Defense gets punished harder than offense  -Some characters straight up feel like final bosses  -It’s so offense heavy I feel like I lose just for trying to KBD  Until they fix the balance and bring back some defense, I’m tapping out of ranked. Maybe even the game entirely. This was my favorite game. :(  (Yes, I'm writing this after an unholy loss streak. Let me cope.)"
165228643,english,0,1778820,"Disappointing is an understatement when it comes to Tekken 8.   This game I will admit I was hyped. Seeing the game play and all the crazy stuff they added looked interesting. Oh boy I was wrong. This game is just a party game that gives anyone a chance to win. You could outplay someone 9-1 but you have to remember the opponent has that 1 and they destroy you because they press their special win button (heat). Heat is a pretty big problem, the single player mechanic it gives isn't fun. I hope they balance heat out but we will see in the future.   I've played ranked for at least 150 hrs getting to the top ranks and I can tell you that ranked and the online play is flawed in many ways. The ranking system is really bad, if you get demoted you have a chance to get that rank back again. It isn't like Tekken 7 when you get demoted you get sent all the way back. But I think this is more for the casual gamer so they don't get demoralised which I understand but why allow it for high ranks? Don't get me started with the plugging (rage quitting) that comes with this game. 7/10 matches you will get a rage quit because the bans are manual from their end. The ban system is really whack, I could hop on like Fariborz or LawofEngland with my macros and not get punished for it. Even if I get banned I can use family share to hop onto another account.   Tekken shop is a disaster, I love getting costumes that modders themselves put into the game for free. The devs had the audacity to screw them over by DMCAing them all so they had to take their mods down. Also the devs have made it super clear they really want to focus on the Tekken shop for obvious reasons because it is their second hand income.   I will change this review when things get fixed and that but I don't suggest at the current state of the game to get it. I will say get it on a sale or wait for patches that fix the problems.   Update Season 2: Soul Calibur 6 devs ruined the game by adding 50/50 which makes the game 2 touch, there is still no skill in the game. Anyone can literally win against a solid player because not everyone is perfect with defence. It is a shame that the game is getting tarnished like this, the copium is gone. o7  Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
166573886,english,0,1778820,"After putting a good amount of hours into the game and reaching High purple/Low blue ranks, I can honestly say that this is the least amount of fun I've ever had with a Tekken game. The amount of catering to new players and spamming playstyles makes the game feel like a coinflip. The introduction of armored powercrush moves, the heat system as a whole, and the return of rage arts makes the game feel like garbage. Movement/sidestepping doesn't feel as rewarding when the opponent can just mash 2+3 and catch you regardless of positioning. The roster is great....the only problem is that you don't see 80% of it in online matches because King/Dragonov/Victor/Reina exist.  For $80 I could have gifted all of my friends a coinflip simulator instead and had about the same amount of fun.  Every match feels the exact same. Apply pressure>Opponent activates heat>Negative frames>Opponent 50/50's>Block for neutral frames>Opponent Powercrushes>Hard knockdown>Wakeup>Block>Take 30% of healthbar from chip damage>Punish>Combo>Opponent Rage Art/Heat Burst>Round lost. Literally every game.   More floor/wall breaks, untechable grabs in certain situations, Dragonov, Losing health on certain inputs that are 100% necessary for relevant combo damage, Dragonov, GOD AWFUL TRACKING/MOVEMENT, No penalty/reward when an opponent ""plugs"", Dragonov, extremely poor matchmaking balance, poor character balance, fan service, the list goes on.  I had high hopes for Tekken 8, but honestly I'm just disappointed. Will likely stick to 2D fighters where things work as intended and make sense.  60% win rate and still deranking. GG Harada.  MONETIZATION IS NOT THE ISSUE."
159573686,english,0,1778820,"Anyone remember back when in Tag 2 Harada said it was wrong to release characters as paid DLC in a fighting game? Then he backtracked on Tekken 7, where the total DLCs cost more than the base game. Then he went even further beyond in Tekken 8 and nerf the customization items, so you have to pay to get more clothing options. What is going to get nerfed in Tekken 9 next? Paying for song choices?  I paid for the ultimate edition just to support this franchise, despite the sh*tty golden clothing no one ever wears... but had I known this in-app purchases would become a thing for Tekken 8. I honestly wouldn't have bothered.  Guess I will learn my lesson for the next Tekken.  EDIT: THE NIBBARINOS AT BAMCO ADDED BATTLE PASS? AYO WTF?!"

178123323,english,0,1778820,"Edit: 4/1/2025  The Devs just released the worst balance patch they probably ever could have for this game. They doubled down on the features that the entire community disliked and told us that this was a patch that would give us more defensive options. By defensive options they meant here are more plus frame moves to force your opponent to block and guess and you need to out mash your opponent for optimal gameplay.  The developers at this point obviously think the community is a bunch of kids who dont know what they want and they absolutely know best so we should just all take it.  Screw that this game sucks ass, do not buy it for Season 2 till they make significant changes.  Original Review: Balance aside, the game launched and then an updated added an in game store revealing why we were missing cosmetics from Tekken 7. Then the battle pass came, and now whenever you login you get 20 notifications saying you got x item or check out the battle pass.  It feels very scummy and they didnt allow season pass owners to get a stage with Heihachi. They are just trying to suck the money out of the playerbase."

159548573,english,0,1778820,"This game is in a very though position to talk about for me. The design behind Tekken 8 forces you to forget almost everything you already know from Tekken, in a fundamental perspective. Characters have lost their identity in general because of game design itself. Most of the cast have a very powerful 50/50, momentun is not a thing since the game greatly benefits you for mashing. The more you mash, the farther you can climb, theres no other way to say this. There is just way too many powerful strings that will make you eat one 50/50 after another. Completely removing one way to play and forcing another feels wrong and I can't understand this game, it's just casino simulator. I've been playing Tekken for almost 10 years and this just feels like something else and I cannot say what it is.  Rank system is garbage and frustrating. It's just not fair to be going with like 7 to 9 win streak in a higher rank (talking about bushin, tekken king, kishin and so on) and only be getting 100 to 200 points maximum per match, and when you lose ONE match (not the ft2, just one match) you lose 1.500 points in just o n e match, even if it is one rank higher. This is just unfair. It would make sense in a lose streak, not in a win streak.  Characters have no real weaknesess, power crush mid that is also heat engager AND safe is stupid. There is a lot wrong with this game and I don't feel like it will be getting fixed anytime soon, I do actually belive that it will become worse if the standard balancing keep going in the casino direction (Eddy).  If you are not playing offense offense offense in this game, you are just dead. Even if you have good defense, the punish you usually get from reading your opponents is not a big of deal most of the time (you can tell by the rage art not being universally launch punishable). Theres soooo many bad decisions in this game that I can't see myself playing much more of this. It's tiring, not fun and stressful.  I think I don't even need to say anything about microtransactions coming out of nowhere, a BUNCH of them added in just a few days. Tekken Shop and Battle Pass??? Battle pass is just greedy since it's just a bunch of items from Tekken 7 and retextures. They didn't even put some efforts in hiding it.  In a much more casual level, this game is amazing, looks awesome and feels very good to play, but thats about it."
160056517,english,1,1778820,"One line review: Tekken8 is amazing.  Slightly expanded review: Probably the biggest leap in quality since Tekken2->3, 8 refines the mechanics from T7, adds modern controls a la SF6, hugely improves the graphics and sound, adds cross play and PvP rematches and makes the game much more accessible to boot. It also adds a real money shop, which, well, is not popular, but is also entirely ignorable.  The sound in particular is great - a blocked quick jab might sound a bit mid, but most hits sound like a damn gunshot and add a heck of a lot to the atmosphere.  The cast of characters is also diverse and fascinating, from giant hugely hard hitting war robots to a hyperfast peruvean coffee-saleswoman who likes nothing more than doging your attacks to hit you from the back, literal devils and demons, a chavvy kind of boxer, a hotheaded taekwando expert, happy shopper bruce lee, a giant championship wrestler who think he's a cat, two kinds of bear, knock-off magic Blade, a gun-toting cyro-frozen irish assassin, a french spymaster who thinks karambit knives are somehow acceptable in a fist fight, a space alien octopus robin hood ninja thing, an egyptian lady who has the literal god of war stuck in her hand somehow and a good two dozen more. More will come with DLC, ofc, but there are plenty to choose from and lots to experiment with.  The really great thing about tekken is that it has an almost abyssal level of depth, with so many mechanics, both new and old. Now this might seem like it would make the game hard to learn, especially if you're new to the series, but it's also really intuitive. You have four buttons, left and right kicks, and left and right punches. That's it! If you want to do a quick right left combo, you press right punch, then left punch. Easy.  If you have good timing, are patient and understand distancing even a little bit, you really don't even need a tutorial, it's that welcoming.  Now, all the above is really only about the PvP mode(s). SP has always been a bit thin in tekken games, but fwiw, I think it's probably at it's best here; there's the campaign which to its credit has tried to mix things up a bit, character episodes which also focus on the non-mainstream characters a bit more, arcade and arcade quest mode and also ghost battles. I guess it's alright? Tekken ball makes a return from 3, which is great, but you can't play it online for no good reason I can think of (e: you can, im just a big dummy, see comments), but the SP definitely takes a back-seat to the PvP modes.  There's also a bunch of nice touches, like how you can play as Tekken3 Jin, how the characters have rivalries and neat fight intros with their nemeses, replays which have advice when you watch them, kazuya's tits are FINALLY splashed all over the main menu*, there is the customary Tekken silliness, weirdness and ott anime moves and also Heihachi Mishima, possibly literally the most terrible person in the world, and easily the worst parent ever has died**. And then reincarnated as his own illegitimate daughter who is, if anything, even more horrifying to fight against. And she also has the devil gene that is basically the reason for everyone fighting in the first place, because of course she does.  One of my most favourite things is hwoarang mirror matches, which usually devolve into showing off, doing the flashiest moves you can and then get to the point where you are just improvising and re-interpreting each others combos in a sort of synchronised dance-off. It's just amazing to be a part of.  Edit: ok im going to write a bunch more about hwoarang and how his depiction in this game is just amazing. See taekwando, as a practiced olympic/ competitive sport, is quite a lot different than it was originally. Now, its about scoring points by, ideally, a spin kick to the head which counts for the most. So, in this game, hwo has a LOT of flashy high kicks which do a lot of damage, while smaller jabs and kicks serve to put the opponent in a place where high kicks count. It's kinda wonderful, really. Even better is that he had a tutor, Baek Doo San, who exemplifed the older more traditional style and now he has some of Baek's moves, rounding out his repertoire and showing he leant from his tutor.  *: Now you can choose which character you see  **: He's alive now, ofc  If you want an example of how silly it can get, here's Panda winning the tournament and then failing to deal with a chair: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dOp9YUJ_ow  I like it. I think it's great and i'm going to play some more right now. But I'm still terrible at it."

188007133,english,0,1778820,"While currently the overall reviews for this game are positive, most of the players that initially played and left their positive review are unfortunately gone.  The game is simply not fun to play at the state it's in. The character balancing is almost non existent in my opinion. The characters that were strong at the launch of the game are still strong a year later. They have pushed out balance changes during the year nerfing some of those characters, but it wasn't enough.  The 3D aspect of the 3D fighting game is more of a gimmick now than it ever has been. If you try to utilize the 3D aspect and sidestep, you can and most likely will at times get punished for trying seeing as a lot of moves track absurdly. The tracking should be heavily changed and nerfed, if you sidestep properly you should be rewarded, the opponent shouldn't just auto-realign to you during their strings. Some moves track right or left and you have to sidestep into the other direction. Some of those same moves track almost a full 180 (some track, but not that much), which leads to confusion as you will get hit when you're sidewalking and are almost behind the opponent.  With a lot of moves tracking where they shouldn't, if you add in absurd hitboxes you get the current condition of Tekken 8. Phantom hitboxes are a thing and I think that's fine as long as it's not too much. But if you add in the fact that when you sidewalked and are beside your opponent while he's doing his move. If you try to attack him before he's done you can and will get hit first yourself. By attacking you extend your hurtbox and for whatever reason there's a big chance you get hit first. That's just stupid.  Season 2 is around the corner, hopefully we will see some improvements.  EDIT: Season 2 is ass"

189798484,english,0,1778820,"This game Is hands down the worst Tekken ever made to date. First, the game is designed to be a button mashing fest where low level and high level gameplay look identical due to the extreme lack of depth in this game. Secondly, the monetization is so bad they re-release content from TEKKEN 7 and charge you for it in their battle pass. Thirdly, character move-sets have been homogenized to the point all characters essentially do the same thing. There are no longer interesting play styles and archetypes in this game. Finally, the story has to be one of the worst written, cringe inducing stories I have had the displeasure of playing. At first it was so bad it was good but now, with the inclusion of Heiachis story the story is an absolute joke. I am a huge Tekken fan and have never been particularly good at Tekken. I got to fujin as my highest rank in Tekken 7 and enjoyed every step of the way including the loses. There was always something to learn and something to improve at. There is always a point in all fighting games where they become 50/50 fiestas and if you enjoy that all power to you, but one thing is certain, this game is not Tekken anymore."
191785769,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 is a game where at ""Tekken King"" you will run into players who cannot break throws, panic rage art the frame they get it, mash at -23, and have no idea how to tech roll or get up from the ground. This was called ""Yellow Rank"" in Tekken 7 but ranked in this game is more akin to the Special Olympics."
176382192,english,0,1778820,"Once legendary fighting game series has lost its way.  It's now tainted with shady monetization practices, questionable ""casino"" gameplay mechanics, nonsensical character balancing and each dlc character is guaranteed to be so overpowered at launch... It's near pay to win.   I've been a fan since Tekken 1 and it's bizarre to see where the series has gone. The once focus on real life fighting styles is also gone and replaced with lasers, guns and other projectiles.  The ultimate edition does not include all dlc (even in the first season). Truly something that would make Ubisoft executives proud.  I hope Tekken team starts to focus more on the core gameplay and less on the atrocious  cosmetics.  Update after Season 2  Movement is pretty impressive now. Tekken team hinted for months about this S2 patch that would balance the game and make defense more feasible....however they have doubled down and made the ""casino"" gameplay even more extreme. The most viable strategy now is to rush down your opponent before they rush you. A pretty sad state of affairs could have been avoided if the devs made gradual small changes; instead of one huge patch with very significant changes, withheld from the community until the very launch.  I was excited to pre order the $100 version of the game when it first was announced. Since then there have been: a battle pass and an in game shop added just post launch Paid cosmetics and a paid stage not included in the $100 version of the game and the game now is so far from what Tekken is that it should probably be named something else.  In its current state Tekken 8 is similar to that time you were finished playing the witcher 3 and started watching the netflix adaptation expecting more good content.  After playing since Tekken 1 and being around in the arcade glory days, I guess this is where I get off.  I truly do hope that Harada and crew can get their act together and get this series back to its glory days...I will pass on S2 dlc until then."
191782728,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 is my first Tekken and I main Reina. I love her and this game to pieces. I've always understood why people preferred the defensive playstyle of previous Tekkens, but I enjoyed the aggressive focus of this game. I felt the aggressor should be rewarded for taking risks, not punished. Defence was now something IMPRESSIVE instead of just being a backdash magic 4 fest. You were still REWARDED for good defence despite it being harder.  I understand this game wants to focus on aggression and appealing to new players and I don't see the point of doing Tekken 7 again. But this is terrible guys. Terrible. You've turned most characters' rushdown into the most braindead, button mash fest it's ever been. Defence isn't hard anymore, it's IMPOSSIBLE. Everyone has good Mid/Low mixes regardless of if they deserved it or not. Character identity is being shot down in the street by removing execution and weaknesses. It is NOT FUN to play a character with NO EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS and NO WEAKNESSES. I am a new player who picked up a MISHIMA. Why do you think new players are some TikTok braindead idiots? And why are you trying to appeal to them when Tekken is famously difficult so they're not going to waste their time on it anyway? And why do your changes not even encourage TikTok braindead idiots to play because they, like everyone, are incapable of guessing correctly more than 50% of the time??? Are you guys just homogenising the cast because it's easier to balance? Why do we pay you then?  Not only is the balance of this patch in SHAMBLES because you removed so many character weaknesses so now they're just perfect. This patch is BUGGED too! Paul has an unintentional unblockable. There are numerous camera glitches resulting in unintentional wall splats. Steve qcf1 STILL randomly whiffs. On and on and on, and guaranteed there will be more the longer the patch is up. Not to mention all the new animations look TERRIBLE. Speeding up animations like Feng's qcf1 makes it look unnatural. Or Reina's d2, 1+2 just copy and pasting her 1+2. Pigeon Roll from Dragunov looks silly. Feng's b4, 2 doesn't match his fighting style at all or even look like a real attack. So you're telling me you spent 4 months on this patch not only for it to be unbalanced, but it also lacks ANY SENSE of quality control? What have you guys been doing all this time to not even test for BUGS?  Worst of all, it has been 24 hours since the patch dropped, and you guys haven't reverted the changes, temporarily taken down the servers or even SPOKEN to us. Not even assured us that you're on it and things will be okay. I still have faith you can fix this, but I'm losing faith that you can balance this game or that you care enough about the pros livelihood or what people sacrifice to try get good at this game. You're gonna do this again. Just like you've added hatchet kicks to characters who don't deserve it multiple times. Given characters tracking Hellsweeps multiple times. Given tracking plus on block moves to characters multiple times.   I don't know what you guys need to change to get it together, but change it and GET IT TOGETHER."

The Side-Step 3D element is ruined by half of the abilities homing. Blocking is a joke when you get slowed with negative frames or take massive chip damage. Everyone has an easy 50% damage launch combo that takes longer than a turn based RPG. Cheating is Rampant and unmanaged... I could go on and on.  If you are a button masher, or a self hating tryhard that is willing to study an impossible amount of frame data to tilt a 50/50 in your favor, you might enjoy this game. If you are sane and just want a simple game where you tussle and express skill, then I wouldn't call this a true fighting game."

Stages have gameplay impact meaning if you care about getting good you need to buy them and practice on them. Your wallet does impact your ability to improve in this game, and the game cost 70 dollar to start with.   Avoid this game for now. The devs doesn't respect you or your time."

Hardly any counterplay, complete homogenisation of pretty much the entire cast with strong mids and power lows, spike enders at the wall, homing attacks when we were going to ""buff sidesteps.""  Season 1 wasn't perfect, far from it, but we were getting used to it and counterplay was being discovered constantly. Whilst the homogenisation problem was still present, ever since T7 I'd argue, characters did indeed feel unique. Now everyone can be plus, have strong counter hits, hit the wall from any point on the stage, just do anything and everything.   In summary, this game doesn't feel like Tekken anymore. Genuinely a hollow shell of what could've been a great game. I'm out, 1.3 seconds."

163347987,english,0,1778820,"Tekken 8 has all the makings of a great game, but once again, Namco seems determined to fumble the ball when it counts most. We're just a couple of months into the game's life, and instead of tackling real issues, Namco seems set on sabotaging its own growth.  I can't recommend the game at it's current state. Devs are either overworked or completely incompetent. Every balance patch they break more things than they fix. Also they would rather change the core game system instead of target nerfing a single character, which results in even more unintended bugs and interactions in the game (broken wall combos, floors not breaking, etc.). They tried to nerf the obnoxious Azucena WR3,4 and it ended up being a buff because you can't even punish it on whiff.  Accidental buffs? Sound familiar? They did the exact same thing when they wanted to nerf Akumas techroll catch in Tekken 7. Instead of target nerfing the problematic interaction, they made a system-wide nerf to tech catches, which ended up taking away a layer of mindgame at the wall for every character. And the best part is, Akuma could still do the tech catch. They've done this many times before and they will do it again, because this is one of the most stubborn group of people that will blame the fanbase before they admit they did something wrong.  After a huge backlash on one balance patch, people demanded more transparency from the devs. So, what did we get? A brief burst of activity from the game directors on Twitter (which lasted about a month) and some half-hearted explanations buried in the patch notes. But they still sneak in changes without telling anyone. They made a huge change to the matchmaking system that resulted in people not finding any matches. I have been searching for a match, while writing this review and I found a single match with a player more than 5 ranks away from mine.  Bandai as a publisher is also not new to the anti-consumer practices. A $70 game is getting a ""battle-pass"" 2 months into it's release with filler, throwaway cosmetics that were available for free in the previous games.  One of the most knowledge check-heavy characters, Eddy, is a $6 DLC character, which you can't lab against if you don't buy him (can't even take over your own character in the replay).  I'm not the biggest modder but the modding scene is a huge part of the Tekken community. Instead of offering cosmetics that people would actually want to pay for, Namco decided to release laughable garbage and go after the modders just so they could squeeze out as much money as possible from their battlepass.  The balance is a mess (see Dragunov, Azucena etc.) but that could be remedied in the upcoming balance patches (lol).  Ranked is also full of pluggers. Instead of getting an automatic win when your opponent plugs, like in every other game, namco decided that its better to keep an excel spreadsheet of the players reported on twitter and manually issue bans to them every other patch... yeah.  Nobody's talking about this, but one of the main reasons I love tekken and not any other fighting game is because of the quality of character animations. All the moves felt like they had weight to them and looked very fluid. However, since the later Tekken 7 seasons (see Lidya's whole moveset, wallbounce) it has taken a huge dive. Some of the new animations in Tekken 8 are outright terrible (tornado animation, everybody getting a backflip move that make the character look weightless ex. Jin). This all culminated with Eddy that had his whole movelist reworked and now looks like he's sporadically jumping between animations when he does a move (no windup, no recovery, moves worse than an MK character). However, this is the least of the games problems. It looks gorgeous otherwise and devs did a great job. This is my favorite game franchise, which I've been playing since Tekken 3 on PS1 and I hate to see it in its current state, but the only way to get through to namco is to stop giving them more money. At the end of the day all they care about is money and this will keep happening if you keep supporting them with your wallets.  In short, Tekken 8 has potential, but until Bamco get their act together, I'd steer clear of this mess. I know this review will read like Im venting, because I am. Im sad to see this happen to my favorite franchise. There's a reason I have 3000 hours in Tekken 7 and just as many playing it offline with people I've met through this game that I can call my lifelong friends. UPDATE:  The upcoming patch seems to be promising. Obviously overtuned characters are getting nerfed and they seem to be providing a lot of free content for damage control. The game needs a few more of updates like these and it will be in a great state. I will update my review accordingly. UPDATE 2:  They were just weathering the storm. Now that people have quieted down, they release Genmaji Temple stage as a separate DLC, not included in season pass or ultimate edition. This company is a joke UPDATE 3: Clive happened. Update 4: Online is basically unplayable. The netcode is absolutely terrible. I dont think I can play another 8 years of this. Update 5: Season 2 is out. Game is balanced if everyone is a broken top 1. Devs are not listening. I would stay away"
191970507,english,0,1778820,"I've loved Tekken since playing T2 in arcades as a kid. I was never great, but enjoyed long sets with friends. Tekken 8 heat system was rough in Season 1 - it messed with character expression and turned matches into Heat spamming.  But Season 2 is a complete mess. It’s not Tekken anymore, just a button-mashing simulator with no depth.  New players might enjoy it, but veterans are better off waiting for changes or skipping it entirely."
162329251,english,0,1778820,"They Banned Iran ip for no reason!  I paid for this game and i can't even play it without VPN and of course its gonna effect on my ping and i'm receiving lots of hate comments from the community cz my ping is 130 ... that's not fair, i played this franchise since Tekken 2 released and now here I am, I cant play without VPN. thank you so much btw , the characters are not balance anymore and the game is not technical as it was before, you just need more luck!"
163598774,english,0,1778820,"PROS: The game is fun at a casual level and it is an improvement on Tekken 7 in terms of load times, graphics, and single-player content. The story is brief and entertaining and the new characters are unique and well-designed.  CONS: The dev team is convinced that making the game more aggressive and flashy (think eSports) is going to make newcomers and casuals more interested in the Tekken series. Personally, I'm not a fan of the gameplay changes. The new universal mechanic (heat) is basically a way to make the game more like advanced rock-paper-scissors and less about skill and game knowledge. I think that one of the cool things about Tekken is how much depth and skill expression there is to the game and heat is a lazy way to even the playing field. Aside from that, there are a lot of issues with the game that have yet to be resolved. There is still no anti-cheat of any kind. The netcode is quite bad for 2024 unless you're playing with a 4-5 bar wired connection. PC players that can't run the game at 60 fps force their opponents to play in slow motion (there is no minimum benchmark score needed to play online). The ranked system is a total mess and it is clear that the devs designed the ranked system to make it easy for new players to see their rank go up without actually getting better at the game. You can't lab pay to win DLC characters in replay mode unless you own them. They added an incredibly low-effort cosmetics store and battlepass system in a $70 game - you also can't buy anything directly, you have to buy 'Tekken coins' which means to get one $5 skin you'd have to pay $10 to have enough coins. Don't expect these problems to get fixed anytime soon. Overall, even though the game is fun, I would not recommend it. I think it's not worth getting into if there are other fighting games that seem equally appealing to you."
162059122,english,0,1778820,"Someone on the balancing team is a few sandwiches short of a picnic and it's really hurting the game.  I don't even feel it's a matter of ""prioritising casual players"" anymore, it feels like the patch was made by an AI language model trained only on satanic scriptures  I can look past the DLC/MTX scummery, suits are gonna be like that, but even the devs are nuts it turns out.. ahh..."
172467636,english,0,1778820,"This is a game that has simply hurt me too many times. I don't mind strong characters, I really don't. I could get my balls handed to me on a silver platter and still have fun, but that's just the thing. Sometimes, this stuff just ain't fun. Maybe it's just me but as a person who's been playing since Tekken 7, I'll just get to the point, I'm not going to say anything like, ""OH, old Tekken good new Tekken bad"", in fact i really enjoy the heat system and overall aggression. But it feels just, way too mashy? You get so minus to a point where sidestepping is literally not an option, and sidestepping itself is already really tricky to get the hang of yet very rewarding, sometimes however it simply feels impossible and you feel trapped and as a player it sucks. I play Paul, Jin, Kazuya, Leo, Dragonouv, and Devil jin, and I notice that I only do well once I start ""cheesing"" which might mean many things to many different people. So I'll be a bit more blunt and just say what my heart feels as of this moment, writing this review.   Neutral does not exist  At least that what it feels like to me, I don't see a point in doing a heat engager cancel in neutral when i'm gonna end up JUST AS MINUS if I had missed it anyways. Countless times I would think, ""Yes this is a safe distance, I will engage heat to utilize my resource advantage over the enemy. Only for them to just RA in response and magically magnetically gravitate towards me? Perhaps this is just a skill issue on my end but aside from that. Some times you feel extremely boxed in. Characters like King, Lidia, just sorta lock you in and once again, this might be a knowledge check, and I might just be bad but keep in mind I'm like the average purple rank. I have a Tekken King level friend that claims I am Kishin level, yet whenever I try to climb the ranks it just feels impossible? I swear I'd be on a 6 winstreak, lose once, and I'd be where I statred. Became a bit of an inside joke where we'd celeberate our ranks by going  ""Hey guys! I ranked from up from mighty ruler to mighty ruler!""  And I wish this was a joke but occasionally I would throw a demotion game, just so I can repromote and get that boost.   Ranking is messed up Footsies feel off There's no other game like tekken but sometimes it just hurts.  I'm open to any comments but I'm really just not in the mood for any git gud or tips. Too heartbroken for that.  I want to love Tekken but as I kept playing I realised that this is NOT healthy for me. I'd play Tekken with my friends and it'd always end in me going into a complain session. The worst part is that they'd just agree with me. All my complaints about random mid combo sideswaps, input eating, sidesteps turning into jumps and ducks, dropping combos because of wall jank. I wanted to be wrong, I wanted to be told ""Hey, ur just bad, here's a tip on how to overcome this"" But no. I'm sure some of you had those moments, maybe they're a lot more rarer than mine, how knows.   But yeah, I'm writing this, with pain and salt in my mind, having just uninstalled it after being deleted by my buddy playing Lidia and Reina.   Tekken is good game. but it's just not good for ME. So, I'm quitting for now.  Maybe I'll come back after a year or two, or when the heihachi DLC drops.  Maybe then it might feel better.   EDIT 25/9/2024 I recently reinstalled Tekken 8 after seeing heihachi, i got filled with hope and motivation. I joined some ranked matches and immediately get reminded of everything I had complained about in the above statement. Maybe it really is a skill issue, but once more.   Can't sidestep because I get locked in. People would rather mash their way out instead of going for parries and sidesteps or simply blocking and waiting for a gap. Which is fine! IF, it didn't work like 80% of the time.  Neutral? What's that? It's a contest of who can overwhelm the other guy first. Footsies only last for like 5 seconds before somebody, be it me, or the opponent, feels the compelling need to throw out some random heat move.  But compared to before, my head is clearer.   So I have suggestions, some of you might like it, some of you might not.  Ngl, KEEP OFFENCE THE SAME. I honestly think this is the most ""FUN"" Tekken in the same way that Guilty Gear STRIVE is the most ""FUN"" Guilty Gear to the masses.  My only problem is that as a player of both games, Guilty Gear has a more streamlined defence, block high, block low, occasionally try a parry and dust grab.  Tekken? You give me side steps, you give me Highs, Mids and Lows to worry about. You give me not just grabs, but different kinds of grabs from tackles, to feints, each with their own unique uses for repositioning, and unique ways to break them too. You give me power crushes, you give me while standings, all these moves, and I get to use NONE of them because I'm minus 100 and the Reina/Lydia/Lars/Victor/Jun is bullying me with their 50/50s and homing stance locks. Once again, maybe to the better players she's not an issue but wouldn't it be nice to actually be able to sidestep in what is basically the ONLY game worth playing that allows it?  TL:DR, Just buff defence. That's it, the options are there, just give the players more opportunities to use them and honestly the game will feel so much better.   Once again, I am the average purple rank player, I play this game for fun, climbing ranks? Sure it's nice to climb but at the end of the day what everybody wants is some GOOD A$$ TEKKEN. Maybe I'm just too defensive in an offense oriented game, but a majority of my playstyle's strength comes from defence. Maybe that's why I feel so limited?  EDIT 2 AS OF 26/10/2024  This time this is a salt review, THE GAME IS STILL TRASH NOTHING HAS CHANGED PEOPLE CAN JUST GET AWAY WITH SO MUCH FORCED 50/50s I DONT GET IT, I CAN'T SIDESTEP, I CAN'T PUNISH AFTER A SUCCESSFUL SIDESTEP (Though I skill issue on my part, I'm talking about the moves that just send the characters flying so far i.e. dragonouv smash) BACK TURN COMBOS ON THE ON THE WALL ARE STILL BEYOND JANK)   is this Tekken or is this 3d Strive man? Because if that's what your going for, Strive executes the aggression idea WAY BETTER.  You are NOT rewarded for having good defense in this game! (Typed this after losing to a sidestep stance spam jun and Victor with that lanky af CH launcher sweep)  Stuff needs to be more minus on whiff so people can't just throw stuff out willy nilly, that or make it so that sidesteps actually work, I swear, in one ranked session alone I have encountered FIVE SITUATIONS where I have sidestepped so hard, that I swapped sides with the opponent, ONLY TO GET HIT ANYWAYS?????  Good news tho, I reached Blue rank (it's the same issue there too...)  Also, I want characters that are hard to play because they require SKILL to use, not characters that are hard to play because they SUCK. Bamco wtf are you smoking with that DLC money bro.......  Edit fir 26/1/2024 Hey guys, I reached blue rank with 3 characters, Jin Paul, And Heihachi, and I'll be honest. Things haven't changed. My blue rank friend is now a Tekken Emperor and even he still agrees it's sort of the same up there in ramks, that is, mashfest. I've improved as a player and have come to realise that it's not neccessarily the characters in this game that are busted and moreso the game itself being busted. That is all.   Blah blah Defense should be buffed, blah blah 50/50 spamfest you know how it goes.  I do have one new complaint though, some characters just seem to have the weirdest autotracking stuff. You'd sidestep something flawlessly and still magically get hit by the second part of the move as they magically lock onto you.   As riduculous as it sounds, Armoured Core 6 (Another game I have been playing) Is a better and more fun fighting game than Tekken, and it's not even remotely close to a fighting game. Weird.  I'm not even writing this update with salt, I've gotten past the salt and reached the point where I'm just empty?  SEASON2... KMS"
192092168,english,0,1778820,"This prolonged April fools joke is getting a bit annoying, can we get the real season 2 patch now?  On a real note, this patch is the most out of touch thing I have seen in any game that I have ever played. What a great ""Defensive"" patch. This new era of Tekken is so void of character archetypes it's actually crazy. Every character is now a brain dead 50/50 stance character with homing plus frames mids and crazy lows.   Every character utilises the system mechanics exactly the same way. We got heat engage into crouch so of course every character needs a crazy full crouch low to be able to take advantage of that, right?  I don't know if this is fixable and at this point I kinda hope Tekken as a series dies, because Bandai Namco does not deserve more money. Let's hope another 3D fighter gets released that can replace Tekken."
167895022,english,0,1778820,"This game was basically designed for people who have negative braincells, everything that makes tekken great has been stripped away to allow for monkeys to pretend like they haven't skipped the last 1000 years of human evolution. The developers are content with allowing players access to mechanics/moves that circumvent skillfull play in favour of basic level coinflips that flood the limbic systems of morons who enjoy engaging in this behaviour.  Don't bother"
159189673,english,1,1778820,"The only other experience I have with Tekken is Tekken 4 from the PS2 era, and that game had a much darker tone than Tekken 8. I still enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would though. It's actually finished unlike MK1, so that's a good plus."
189030963,english,0,1778820,"I’ve dedicated countless hours to honing my skills, striving to showcase my abilities at the highest level possible. This recent S2 patch, however, has drastically undermined my chances and those of many players like myself. It’s essential to take the art of Tekken seriously for self-improvement, and I’m beginning to question if this game’s current state supports that goal.  I’m not pleased with how this change has affected my character and the game overall. It feels as if I’m being pushed into a play style that doesn’t align with my approach. This patch has been incredibly frustrating and needs urgent attention. Despite all my hard work—practicing, studying my opponents, and analyzing gameplay—it all seems to lose meaning when I’m forced to eat unearned 50/50's and adopt a style more suited to a BlazeBlue character. Losing the essence of my character is something I cannot accept. At this point, I barely recognize who I’m playing and what I'm playing anymore...  Please fix the game that I love and worked so hard to be competent at...."
162356581,english,0,1778820,Great game if you don't wanna play tekken  Horrible game if you want to play tekken  Netcode got worse somehow. Balancing decisions are pretty horrible at best. I paid for deluxe edition thinking I was gonna invest another 5 years into this title as I have in tekken 7 but instead I only reluctantly boot it up once every 3 days for 30 minutes before getting annoyed at the loss of my favorite franchise.  Also what is with this f2p game monetization stuff I paid full money for this. Fuck you bamco >:|
190793718,english,0,1778820,"this game used to be about knowledge, reading and responding to your opponent. You had to earn your mixups and frames. tekken 8 throws it all out of the window to appeal to the idiot casual players who cant do shit and dont wanna learn the game. its just easy spamming buttons get forced 50/50s and forced jailing strings. random bullshit. player level and fun of the game have dropped significantly, just to appeal to the idiotic casual people. Its just easy and stupid. No brains no knowledge required. tekken 7 ruler ranks are like tekken king/god in this dumbass game. that explains alot   EDIT: SEASON 2 i didnt even download it yet my friend showed it and i am geniuenly disappointed and have 0 faith in them. few characters had stances and thats what that made them different. few characters had homing safe moves and that was their unique feature. tekken 8 just gave everyone everyhting power mids, infinite plus +8 startup braindead mixups, homing moves, while running stance moves. EVERYTHING FOR THE BRAINDEAD CASUALS WHO WILL PLAY FOR 3 DAYS AND LEAVE OR YOUR AVERAGE BRAINDEAD FUJIN PLAYER TO HAVE FUN VERY GOOD DEVS YOU FUCKED UP VERY BIG THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE JUST CASINO THATS IT. NOTHING ELSE POWER MIDS HOMING MIDS INFINITE BROKEN MIXUP AFTER MIXUP AFTER 50/50 AFTER 50/50. btw im not crying like i dont know anything about this game. i got to tgp elo with lee on t7 and easy GoD on tekken 8. all my chars were minimum tekken king or higher dumbass game.   im quitting this shit ass game"

A year later can't even say I like the game anymore. They managed to have EVEN WORSE monetization (character+stage pass costs MORE than character pass + stages bought separately) and they doubled down on the gameplay issues.

Tekken is not supposed to be a ""party game"" because of the sheer amount of knowledge checks... yet this game manages to be. 50/50, plus frames, heat, mixups, armor, safe strings, broken S tiers. This game is a gimmick in itself and I'm embarrassed to have put so much time into it. The better you get at this game, the more you will dislike it. I promise you. I will not go another year expecting this game to feel fair or balanced.

Either make it that the graphics revert back after the match or just OPTIMIZE THE GAME."
162333981,english,0,1778820,"Ive been saying this for over a year now lmao  every change they had introduced since the release of the game has been to remove depth from decision making and force raw 50/50s from low-no risk options. on top of this the premium battlepass (which im not inherently against) is filled with low quality items and the dev team is not interested in listening to the communities thoughts and issues. bugs from day 1 are still unfixed and it took them 2 months to introduce a feature t7 had from release. you can still lag the game out by pressing screenshot and theres no meaningful punishment for plugging, even if you do plug you can just go into a lobby with a friend for a couple games and your DC rate is removed since it only counts the last 50 games. how they intend to keep a competitive community with entirely one sided communication, not testing their patches and making the low quality t7 rank system significantly worse is beyond me. would not recommend anyone who is interested in learning the game at an even slightly deeper level invest their time into it until the dev team decides to do the same"
191713020,english,0,1778820,I dunno man. This game increasingly favors the aggressive style of play and rewards the player for it. more 50/50 gets added to the game and defense feels worse every match.  I dunno why it is such a good feeling for players to framelock someone until their HP bar hits zero. Especially problematic in heat where you just block and pray to not die.   The best defense is offense here which destroys the punishment aspect of the game. I don't even feel like my opponent is reacting to my stuff. They are not thinking about what i'm doing they just force their offense on me and hope i didnt lab every DLC character.

In a game I've been playing for 25 years, for the first time I feel like I have to sadly leave the game I fell in love with at one time.

Everyone got crazy tracking moves and 50/50s so you're better off playing it as a 2d fighter. Just spam powercrush, throw your broken tracking move, rely on chip, never stop pressing buttons. Its not fun, it limits player expression, and worst of all ITS BORING."
161731219,english,0,1778820,"Amazing game, extremely fun to play. I can't speak about balancing as i am new to learning fighting games. I cannot recommend this game though, because of the despicable MTX practices they have decided to implement AFTER reviews were in. i believe buying costumes is an ok way to try to have fans continue to support the developers (as long as base game customization is great) EXCEPT when you CANNOT buy them directly and instead need to buy a premium in-game currency, as it can (and does) lead to overpaying/overspending. And now they have decided to introduce a battlepass which i believe is completely unnecessary, and another way to try to squeeze money out of players through FOMO. Overall this game is crazy fun and if you can ignore the MTX then please go ahead and buy it if that's what you want to do, but if you're on the fence and unsure whether you'd like it even after trying the demo, i would suggest not buying it to not support these greedy and anti-consumer practices."

Not happy with that, since it clearly is a useless piece of garbage that doesn't actually prevent cheating, they decide to randomly block Virtual Machines YEARS AFTER THE GAME HAS BEEN RELEASED.  I have played 126h all of which using a VM with GPU passthrough. Why? Because I will not allow such malware to run on a Windows installation where I keep my own data. And neither should anyone, really, considering the risks this software poses if hacked.  So either allow turning off the anticheat to play in offline mode!

I hope shareholders tear your soul to shreds while they're clawing you down into the hell you belong in with them.  You're a cancer and the only proper solution is for you to get too large to get doctor government to notice you and inject the EA tumor with legal action that makes them unable to get monopolies on sports licenses in the future.

FIFA 23 is a blast to play with friends, thanks to its awesome graphics and super smooth gameplay. But man, the VAR system can be a headache—it messes up calls too often. And honestly, it feels like we're playing the same game every year, with not much new stuff added.

167644910,english,0,1811260,"If FIFA 23 were a footballer, it would be that overhyped transfer who spends more time adjusting his hairband than actually playing. EA Sports has delivered yet another installment of their beloved franchise, but calling it ""beloved"" might be pushing it. It’s like they heard ""if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it"" and decided, ""Let’s just break a few things for fun.""  Firstly, the graphics are stunning. So stunning, in fact, that you’ll be stunned into a state of confusion when you realize the faces of some players look like they’ve been modeled by someone who has only seen humans through pixelated CCTV footage. Cristiano Ronaldo’s cheekbones could cut glass, but in FIFA 23, they look like they’ve been run over by a Zamboni.  The gameplay, oh the gameplay. It’s as smooth as a buttered weasel on roller skates. By that, I mean it’s chaotic and nearly impossible to control. The new HyperMotion technology promises realistic movements, but if by ""realistic"" they mean your players sometimes forget they have knees, then mission accomplished. Watching your defender pirouette like a confused ballerina while trying to clear the ball is something you’ll have to see to believe.  And let’s talk about the new Career Mode. It’s like being promised a promotion at work only to find out you’ve been moved to the basement next to the janitor’s closet. The addition of “cinematic moments” in Career Mode is a nice touch, assuming you enjoy cinematics that have the emotional depth of a teaspoon. Your player can now engage in thrilling activities like... sitting on a bench and looking pensive. Riveting stuff.  Ultimate Team continues to be the cash cow of the franchise. EA’s motto seems to be, “Why improve gameplay when we can just make more shiny cards?” Building your dream team is exciting, but the excitement fades faster than a New Year’s resolution when you realize your wallet is emptier than a footballer’s head after a long night out.  The commentary team is back and as lively as ever. They repeat themselves with the enthusiasm of a broken record. If you’ve ever wanted to hear the same fact about a player’s youth career in Shrewsbury for the 47th time in a match, FIFA 23 has got you covered.  In conclusion, FIFA 23 is like a football match where both teams forgot to bring the ball. It’s full of potential but ends up being a lot of running around with no real purpose. If you’re looking for a game to laugh at and occasionally play, FIFA 23 is your go-to. Just remember, it’s all fun and games until your star striker decides to moonwalk into the goalpost."

Not to mention, my team is completely glued to their positions. If they ever make any kind of run, and its always at the wrong time, its just a straight run and there's no way for me to get a through ball in, especially when my opponents are buffed for speed and strength. I even tried messing with the game settings such as how positioning and aggression and runs my players make. It still does no good. Online has all the same issues and more. The ai is still useless on your team but any online game I play in is probably the glitchiest game I have played. Ball goes through players, players mangle their own bodies to take impossible shots, and don't even get me started on these goalies. If you plan on playing this game for serious competition, don't. The career mode isn't bad except for the ai teammates. I would only recommend playing this game if you just want to play easy and mess around in offline or have an easy career.

173540791,english,0,1811260,"Even though I played 300+ hours, I can't recommend it. The reason for that number is that there is no alternative that is hyper-realistic and allows a player career which is the main way I play. I am an offline-only player, so I can't judge how the online is, but the singleplayer experience lacks any kind of game design principles. The additions every year are lacking, the logic is shaky and the gameplay is dubious at times. The bugs are there and they can even be game-breaking (a goal scored because the keeper's hand suddenly was broken in a literal sense or the AI switching a field player for a goalie and getting a bunch of free goals). I am 100% sure I will never buy another FIFA or EA FC game and I am eager to find a product that can compare to this and move there forever."

169208742,english,1,1811260,"[h1] FIFA 23: Where Every Game Feels Like Groundhog Day on the Pitch [/h1]  Ah, FIFA 23, the game where kicking a digital ball has never felt so familiar. Strap in for another round of soccer (or football, for the purists), with all the highs and lows of a rollercoaster ride you’ve been on a thousand times before.  Graphics: Sick. Like, really sick. They’re so good, you’ll start believing you’re watching a real match on TV... until your player magically teleports through an opponent’s leg and scores from halfway across the field. Realism, what’s that?  Gameplay: Butter. Smooth as a baby’s bottom, and just as predictable. Every pass, every dribble, every goal feels like you’ve done it before, because you probably have, in every FIFA game since the dawn of time. But hey, at least your thumbs are getting a workout.  VAR System: Oh, VAR. The bane of every FIFA player’s existence. It’s like having your annoying little brother constantly interrupting your game to argue about whether that goal should count or not. Spoiler: It usually shouldn’t, but who’s keeping score when VAR’s around?  Innovation: What’s that? FIFA 23 brings you the same game you love with slightly shinier graphics and a few token new features that nobody really asked for. Women’s FIFA World Cup™? Check. Cross-play? Sure, if your idea of cross-play is getting destroyed by PC players while you struggle on your console.  Community Gripes: “Feels like they’re recycling stuff from previous games.” Well, that’s because they are. But hey, who needs innovation when you can just update the player rosters and call it a day? FIFA 23: because why fix what ain’t broken (or even if it is, just add some more VAR drama)?  Conclusion: FIFA 23 is like that old pair of sneakers you can’t throw away because they’re comfy, even though they smell a bit funky. It’s fun with friends, frustrating with strangers, and a constant reminder that sometimes, the more things change, the more they stay the same.  So lace up those virtual cleats, grab your controller, and get ready for another year of digital soccer that’s as reliable as your uncle’s bad jokes at Thanksgiving. FIFA 23: same game, different year, but hey, at least the graphics are sick, right?"

168327084,english,1,1811260,Absolutely fucking shite mechanics. But no other competitor with the same experience.
124807300,english,0,1811260,"(UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)  Game doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.  Requested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.  Game won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.   UPDATE:  Filed a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund.   So, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.  Also Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??   UPDATE 2 (1/1/2023); Finally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others) -Uninstall Fifa 23 -Uninstall EA App -Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder  -Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder -Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator. -Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors -Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off -Restart -Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator -Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam -Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder. -Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam -Restart Open Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY  NOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.  I still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again."
127633672,english,0,1811260,"[h1] The biggest fall from grace I have ever seen [/h1]  [b] Technical Issues [/b] If you buy this game you might not be able to start it like the majority of people as you will see in other reviews. In order to start this game you will firstly need to enter your BIOS, on your high end PC, and change some settings, which if you don't know what you're doing can be extremely risky to the health of your PC. And from then on you will need to uninstall and re install EA's anti cheat on every start up of this game. Once in game you'll find that despite your ultra expensive custom high end PC, the menus are extremely laggy and unresponsive. If you want to tab out of this game, be sure that when you tab in, to move your mouse cursor to the very top right of your screen and out the way, because this game cannot disable the mouse while playing so if the mouse is hovering over a certain menu icon, and you try to navigate with your controller instead, the game will simply bug out. So just from a technical stand point this game is already atrocious.  [b] Gameplay Issues [/b] The game should be advertised as arcade, not the hyper realistic game it markets to be with all these new motion captures, ball physics etc that mislead. The gameplay is arcade, plain and simple. Remember FIFA matches being 5/6 mins a half, [i] by default. [/i] Well this time the default is now 3 minutes a half, why? Because any longer, even on the highest difficulty, the score of the match will be 7-7 and you will be fighting against the game just to keep the score down to actually feel a sense of realism. Dribbling is so stupid I can't even put it into words, players are on ice here, no studs in the ground, every player has 1000 agility, because the way they chop and turn and dribble makes no sense, not even Messi can dribble like this in real life, and this is amplified against the AI on any high difficulty, you will not get the ball for at least 2.5 minutes of the 3 minute half because their dribbling is simply uncontrollable.  [b] Career Mode [/b] We all know career mode has been on the decline in forever, which every new feature either breaking the game or being pointless, the dynamic sim feature where you watch dots play like its FM needs so much work, its so bare bones and you will always need to jump in to save your side losing. The new highlight mode is complete garbage with only having a select few highlights, so once you've seen and played a few, you've played them all, and the scenarios get extremely repetitive because of this. Transfers get a transfer rating and whoever rating your business literally has 0 business sense, and you'll likely get sacked for making good business, not to mention you can't loan players out because every loan offer is a loan to buy with a stupid price that can't be negotiated without the deal falling through. All in all another stinker for career mode.  [b] Online [/b] I never got round to playing online as I spent all of my short time in this game troubleshooting and trying to fix the offline game play with various slider settings. But I can imagine the arcade feel of this game translates well to an online simplified experience where you do ridiculous skill moves and score plenty of goals. FUT mode is absolutely packed with features and I would recommend this mode if you have plenty of money you want to spend on getting the best players and items.  [b] Conclusion [/b] I have played FIFA all my life, since FIFA 2004, growing up with the game, buying it every year and without fail playing hundreds of hours. FIFA 17 onwards my hours declined as did the game, but it was still playable up until this release. I can't understand how this game was even able to release in the technical state its in and I genuinely can't believe the huge decline this franchise has gone on over the past half a decade. I'm extremely disappointed. But this game really shows EA for what they are, with extreme amounts of income, can't even spend on the resources to make this game actually playable, its a complete ripoff of all its fans and the kids that spend serious amounts of money on FUT every year, and everyone who has bought this game year in year out faithfully to play career mode.  Utter disaster, don't purchase this game.  [h1] 0/10 [/h1]"

124971934,english,0,1811260,"I've played this around 200 hours. I was elite division in the previous game, have played games professionally throughout multiple platforms. Hands down without a shadow of a doubt this is the worst game i have ever played, if you want to feel like you are being completely robbed out of any competitive experience throughout the whole game then this is the game for you. It seems to me this is another case of great idea yet with a terrible, unreliable and straight up horror of a company executing it.   Short list of my major issues with this game. - Majority of defending is automatic in this game so normal through balls are basically magnet practice for the defenders (My own players included doing unbelievable and quite frankly impossible tackles without me pressing a button) - Passing is a joke and could go anywhere at any random moment. - Someone can press one button and make the game unplayable with man marking and pressing tactics. - Ballon d'or level players heavy touching the ball, not being able to even control a simple pass. - Sometimes the ball resembles that of the black out ball from men in black. - Tackle someone multiple times to watch the ball magnet back into one of the oppositions players  - Visibly being able to see my players get held back/ handicapped from going for the ball.  I could honestly make these stupidly long, there is so many more game play issues.  I'm not one for conspiracy theories but the DDA thing that everyone raves about seems quite visible in my eyes, some kind of momentum system built into the game or it could be the game play is that bad its turned a large portion of this community to even think it exists. On top of that they basically have a gambling system built into the game to scrape as much money as they possibly can even being visible to kids and vulnerable people.  I hope they never get another FIFA contract, should be a criminal act to release a £60 game in this state. I have never wrote a review on a game in my life but this one has angered me too the point where if i can save one person from buying this game it would be worth it.  Edit: People asking why i keep playing. I play the WL for coins and every time i do it makes me so angry to a point that no human being should ever feel like from playing a video game, the other time is just sat in the menus wishing the game was fun. Follow suit if you enjoy mental torture."

Steam refuses to issue a refund because I ""used some sort of in game content,"" or whatever. Maybe it's because I got the Ultimate Edition. I've never actually successfully loaded this game... but Steam says I've used some sort of in-game content? What a scam.  I've checked online, and this is a very common problem. I've literally spent hours trying to fix it. I waited for several patches, done the dns flush, the admin mode ""fix,"" the reset the cache on the EA app, changed the certificates on certain files... everything you can imagine. No dice. I just tried recently, thinking that the patches may have ironed things out and now it appears as though there are new problems. But the result is the same, and the game still won't launch.  It's really sickening that EA can sell games that won't even launch and get away with it, and Valve will deny refunds for them. It's honestly something should be settled with a class action suit.

I'm not experiencing the issues Windows 11 users are, and the game starts up just fine for me. That being said, this game has serious issues that shouldn't be present in a game that has basically followed the same formula for the past decade. It should be getting easier to get this stuff right, not harder.  1. On start up, I can't load my existing career save. The menu option just isn't there. To get around this I have to start a new career, and as soon as I'm able to, exit out. I'll then have the option to load my existing save.   I have to do this everytime I load up the game.  2. Not as serious, and probably for the best... I can't purchase FIFA points. I wanted to invest a small amount just to get started in FUT. Nope, constant error with the store. Just doesn't work, this is fine though, means EA don't get any more money from me, and I get to focus on career and other game modes.  3. Menu and UI glitches. Trying to manage multiple transfer requests at once is buggy as hell. Can't move up and down the list half the time. This issue is not limited to this menu, however this is where it is most annoying, as I have to constantly leave and re-enter.  Gameplay: It's fine, and the only thing about this game that seems to work as intended. It's a bit slower, but FIFA over the years changes it's focus from time to time when it comes to gameplay and the rest of us just have to adjust.

Our biggest issue is how EA treat us and how we let them get away with it every year.  With FIFA 23, I haven't had any issues while playing the game, but as all of us know, this game has problems opening, a lot, and it's down the anti-cheat that EA has implemented with this game.

I have a good PC and no game has ever used this many resources. It runs at 144fps, but the temperatures and % usage is unacceptable.  - Limiting the game to 60fps via the graphics menu does not work since it's a Vsync setting (full or half frames) based on your monitor refresh rate. This is something that hasn't been fixed for a few years now.  Both this and gpu usage were fixed by changing graphics to low and limiting fps to 60 via Nvidia control panel.  Keep in mind that even if you manage to make the game work, it's not guaranteed to keep working in the future. The gameplay is also a considerable downgrade from last year, but some people like it so I suppose that's subjective. Overall, it's clear that they don't care about PC.

FIFA 23 doesn't even work... It's now a week after release and some folks still aren't able to even launch the game, I have to start Origin in Administrator Mode for it to work, but at least I can play. That being said, servers are trash. They always were, but it's even worse this time. Navigating through the menu's feels buggy and rough around the edges, the game is poorly optimized, and they even haven't fixed some issues that were in FIFA 22, which is astonishing to me.  But now for the most important part, the gameplay. This is where FIFA 23 has it's occasional shine. PC-Players finally got Next-Gen after being completely ignored with FIFA 22 last year. While playing the game, you can feel the game isn't as arcade-like anymore. It's much more slow-paced, and you have to actually think about your next move or pass on the pitch. On the other hand, the AI is mind-blowingly dumb... Players are standing still when the ball rolls past them 15 centimetres away from their feet. Or suddenly your attacker cancels his run past the last defender, which is incredibly frustrating. And maybe the most ridiculous and game-breaking one, if you play against the AI, for example in Career Mode or Squad Battles, the opponent's goalkeeper can't even receive a pass... Like seriously, they are scoring own-goals like it's nothing.  Some new features like the Power Shots are fun and make for some absolute bangers, but the game overall is underwhelming. This combined with the fact that some people that paid 70 or 80 bucks (!!!) can't even start up the game, gave me the feeling I should write a review for this 5/10 game.

But let's talk about the real star of the show: the AI. Wow, what a thrill it is to be completely outclassed by the computer at every turn. It's almost as if the game was designed specifically to make the player feel completely helpless and incompetent. And let's not forget about the matchmaking system, which always manages to pair me up with players who are significantly more skilled than I am. It's like a never-ending cycle of misery and disappointment.  But the worst part has to be the microtransactions. I mean, who doesn't love spending their hard-earned money on virtual players that are completely and utterly useless? It's a great feeling to know that I can spend real money on a game that is already so overpriced, just to have a slightly better chance at winning.  Overall, I can't recommend FIFA 23 enough.

The game wont feel like it's worth the full amount as it is a Fifa 22 re-skin. However, it still is a solid pick up for the offer and you wont feel let down. After so long the game looks better on PC and the gameplay is solid too. Defending feels way less sloppy and keepers are more closer to their human counterparts. Attacking can be done cleverly and defenders no longer catch up to you as pace ratings play a more important role atleast from what i have experienced. That said, the game isnt completely bug free with occasional glitches popping up even in my short span of play but it isnt cyberpunk level broken. I obviously do not support the way EA milks the FIFA series but this game definitely deserves a slightly better rating.

[*] EA has DISABLED [url=https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay?snr=1_7_7_230#together]""Remote Play Together""[/url], so you won't be able to invite your friends & play remotely, instead each one of you will have to pay $60. (Note that game publishers in Steam have the ability to enable or disable this). [*]The mouse cursor hides itself at the center of the screen but in some instances it's still functional, meaning that if you're trying to select an option located on the edges, it won't let you & you'll think your controller is unresponsive, but is just the invisible mouse in the middle. So you'll have to move it away in order to be able to select the other options. You can reproduce this issue going into FUT > Moments.  [*]If you have 2 controllers & want to play split-screen, both players should use the same button layout. None of you can use different control settings because if one is different, it will overwrite the other player controller settings.  [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/qjt7sk/xbox_series_x_fifa_22_second_controller_settings/]This happens to some users since FIFA 21 across all platforms,[/url] yet it has never been addressed by EA, which tells us they only care about FUT.  [*]After scoring a goal, the ball keeps rolling even if the player takes it with their hands as a celebration.  [*]The ""classic"" button scheme has been remapped, which doesn't affect me but I'm just mentioning it for those who care: [b]LB+RB[/b] has been changed to ""power shot"". To execute a ""Low Driven shot"" you should gently press [b]B[/b] and release it asap. [b]LT+B[/b] does an outside foot shot if you're running.  [*]Sometimes your controller & camera settings won't get saved after closing & opening the game, it's a pain having to set it up every single times. [*]Australia women's national team has been removed.  [/list]  There's a 10-hour trial of this new FIFA 23 on [url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass]Xbox PC GamePass ($1 the 1st month)[/url], & the whole game will be added to PC GamePass 7-9 months after its launch day (May-July 2023) like when they've added Fifa 22. So you should go try it. If 10hs aren't enough, you can buy EA Play Pro ($15 a month) & you'll get to play the whole game for 30 days, all the hours you want. Personally I would recommend waiting till the game hits $30, only then I'd buy it."

131521491,english,0,1811260,"I have hundreds of hours on older titles mostly on the Ultimate team mode and i could easily say do not buy this game. It's beyond broken on PC and i will point out everything bad me or my friends saw after 130+ hours on it.   I will start with the few positives about it so i can give credit where i can. - Career mode is fun and well done and most likely the only mode where you will enjoy the game.  - Pro clubs is okay and Online Seasons too.   - Fun to play with friends (when it works).    And here are the negatives.  - First and the most important it's a gamble if the game would even start because the anti-cheat is so broken and after every patch there is some kind of problem that you need to fix for it to run and it's just a joke EA doesn't bother doing something about it after so many months.  - The PC version of the game is not optimized at all compared to the next gen on console's it uses a lot of CPU for no reason. Even if you are in the menu browsing and doing something you could still feel the slight delay especially compared to older FIFA's. - Graphics on PC aren't good even on maximum settings.  - Connection is again awful in most of the game modes especially in FUT which is unacceptable for a company that makes so much money every year and doesn't buy any proper good servers. - This is something that happens to a friend of mine and i've heard it happens to a lot of people as well, when you open packs in FUT if there is a high rated walkout player the game crashes (He is with an Amd graphics card it seems there is no problem with the Nvidia ones)  - If you make a custom settings for your controller the game resets it all the time for no reason so you have to pause during the match and do them again which gets super annoying.  - Compared to older Fifa's they made huge FUT events like Team of the year for example which is running right now awful for the players making SBC's drain your coin balance and make you give more players than you get in return which just forces you to buy more and more Fifa points to keep up.  -  A big reason for me to buy this game was the new Cross-play they promoted so much and the Cross-Market in FUT but guess what? You can only play FUT friendlies with a person who has a console, You can't play seasons , Pro club , Co-op or anything fun. FUT market is also not cross platform for PC for absolutely no reason (only PlayStation and Xbox share market now) - And now the most annoying thing in the game in my opinion is the Scripted gameplay in Ultimate team mode and what i mean by this is the game makes you lose. It doesn't matter how good of a player you are the game will make you lose against worse players than you. You will hit the Goalpost nonstop the ball will randomly drop in the enemy player's foot , after tackles the ball will stay in him, you can have expected goals 5 and your opponent can have 0.9 but still he will win 3-2 against you and this usually happens in matches you really need to win for FUT champions or draft.   Seriously don't buy this game and don't give EA money if you really really want to play it just buy it on a next gen console on a big sale or have someone gift it to you other than that you will hate yourself for wasting your money for buying another EA game which is completely broken."

Never had these issues in all past Fifa's I have played and thought the bad reviews were a bit over the top, until I bought it and the first thing that greeted me was ""Secure boot not enabled""... Ok then, - after some googleing I came accross some solutions that mentioned issues with the anti-cheat, so followed all those, but none worked. Ok sure, I'll turn on Secure boot then purely for Fifa as I generally think the games are worth it. After that the game finally ""started"" but got stuck on the startup screen with 3000fps and my GPU going haywire.. tried a couple times and gave up as I didn't feel like troubleshooting even more then I already spent JUST TO GET THE GAME STARTED. Refunded, what a buggy mess, even before getting in-game. Do not buy on PC, unless they get rid of the ridiculous anti-cheat that causes most of these issues. DO NOT BUY ON PC.   -> Edit1: Gave it some more troubleshooting and put a manual FPS limit on the game - so the startup-screen is now locked at 165hz from my monitor, and it did eventually start. Still not recommended unless you are willing to go through the trouble to get it to work.  Edit2: After every update you will have to go through a couple of steps to get it to work AGAIN... otherwise the game does not start at all (even though it says it's running on Steam). This has to do (still) with the anti-cheat, you will have to go through some trouble with installing certificates and manually updating the anti-cheat client. Maybe some day they will fix it, but for now still really NOT recommended!"

133133805,english,0,1811260,"I was quite disappointed with EA SPORTS™ FIFA 23, to be honest. As a longtime fan of the series, I was expecting some significant improvements and exciting new features. However, it felt like I was playing the same game as last year, with very little added innovation or changes.  The graphics and animations were also underwhelming. In an age where other games are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of graphics, FIFA 23 felt outdated and unimpressive. Additionally, I experienced several audio glitches and poor sound quality, which made the overall experience quite frustrating.  To make matters worse, the game had numerous bugs and glitches that affected gameplay. These issues were so severe that I lost progress and, in some cases, lost matches. It was quite frustrating and took away from the enjoyment of the game.  Finally, I have to say that the pay-to-win elements were really disappointing. It felt like the game was designed to force players to spend money to progress and improve, which really took away from the sense of accomplishment that comes with mastering a game through hard work and dedication.  Overall, I have to say that FIFA 23 fell short of my expectations. It lacked innovation, had outdated graphics and animations, and was plagued by bugs and glitches. The pay-to-win elements were also a significant downside, and I can't say that I enjoyed the overall experience."

Easy fix, only have one main controller in.   I haven't played since Fifa 17 on the good 'ol Xbox 360 and recently bought Fifa 22 which I was blown away with. Fifa 23 being 45% off I bought it and well, I'm generally impressed. The PC graphics from 22 to 23 have improved tenfold, new animations and the gameplay generally is more realistic in my opinion. I feel as though I'm rewarded for scoring against AI.  THE AI:  Bloody AI is so unpredictable you have a League 2 team starting to be prime barca with the passing. Easy fix, sliders. Other than the occasional ""wtf"" goal, it's not too bad out of the box.   70/100 recommend to a career player.  I've been lucky and haven't experienced any glitches which makes me upset.

Minor changes from game to game, but the old errors, bugs and crutches remain.  As if the developers need 2 parts of FIFA to fix 1 little bug. It's a laughing stigma for a company like this.  But as if that's not enough, the game continues to abound with a bunch of ****. Broken anti-cheat, which causes 75% of errors on launch, crashes and bugs in career mode that ruin save files, some strange [strike]s**t[/strike] with disconnects in the middle of matches.  And all this will not be fixed. Why? Because there are a million different colored cards of one and the same player from France, which will always drop you, once again giving you a momentary feeling of happiness that it may be Mbappé.  UT's Moments mode is cool. Thanks for that one, but everything else is...  Only in UT could it be that a golden ball winner's card is worse than a rookie's card, with speed and strikes boosted up."

The only consistency in this fucking mess is the lack of consistency, the running, the tackles, the passes, the shots it's just dogshit. Besides FUT being a cashgrab and its so called gameplay being ""totally accurate"" and reflecting the stats on the cards like William Carvalho catching up to Mbappe during a sprint or Jorge Campos (playing outfield) winning a header against VvD or even Insigne winning dribbling past Coates while being pressed by him.

125456831,english,0,1811260,"Some improvement over the last edition I played (2021), but the biggest edge hasn't been smoothed. Probably my last EA soccer game.  [b]Frostbitten[/b] The game's biggest strength has also been it's biggest weakness for years. The Frostbite engine has put in place hundreds if not thousands of flexible animations which allow play to branch at every possible angle creating beautiful, dynamic gameplay. The cost for this is [i]the game putting ~5 yard radius force-fields around players[/i] immediately on the ball making closing down players incredibly and unnecessarily difficult. The close down option is insufficient for higher level play and using the jockey button sends you out of position if the ball handler does pretty much anything (I think the game assumes that you were faked out by whatever they did, even if they slightly changed pace in the direction that you are going).  [b]Player Career Mode[/b] Player career mode still has issues. I had my controller disconnect mid-match. When I reconnected, the game assumed that I switched teams and prevented any achievement progress. Much worse, [i]the camera stopped acknowledging my existence[/i] to instead focus only on the ball. The team I was playing for also loved swapping my position mid-play (Could be minute 80, could be minute 25). While poor form in itself, the fact that [i]nothing on screen acknowledged the change[/i] caused confusion and multiple out of position rating deductions. It is not uncommon for this to happen multiple times in a game, adding a layer of frustration and paranoia to my favorite game mode.  [b]Miscellaneous Feel Bads[/b] Launching the game feels like a chore with the long anti-cheat pre-load section which also triggers multiple system yes/no alert prompts. The UX also feels unresponsive at times with the UI sometimes waiting seconds between user action and any on-screen acknowledgement (Audio or visual). Not sure if this is because the UI is trying to process and show too much information or if there is a threading issue, but the UI is too slick looking for the game to not at least trigger a sound effect when the user performs a menu action.  [b]Bright Spots[/b] There are some bright spots. The menus continue to get prettier and more streamlined. When the force-fields are down, there is a lot of fun to be had in the close quarters dueling, especially on offense. The overall gameplay continues to feel a bit more fluid. Making money relevant in player career mode as well as having personality choices are a welcome change, even if they don't seem to have much of an effect on play.  [b]It's Time[/b] I have enjoyed the game for decades, but fighting against both the other team and the engine to play good defense continues to be a very frustrating experience. It's been an issue for years, and it's not changing in any meaningful way. Couple that with the menu and career issues and playing the game becomes tiring. I'm exhausted. I'm done. It was a good run, but goodbye FIFA/EA Sports FC. I think it's time that I move on."

EA made the same game from 2016 to 2023, with almost no new features, because they only care about ultimate team and nothing else, they farm money every year with almost no effort and they still cant make this game launch normally like any other game or even adding something new, at least this FIFA will be the last one made by this garbage moneygrabbing company so not everything about this game is bad."

Any and all combinations of the above does not work.  Requested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.  Game won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.   UPDATE:  Filed a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund.   So, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.  Also Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??

I still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again."
127633672,english,0,1811260,"[h1] The biggest fall from grace I have ever seen [/h1]  [b] Technical Issues [/b] If you buy this game you might not be able to start it like the majority of people as you will see in other reviews. In order to start this game you will firstly need to enter your BIOS, on your high end PC, and change some settings, which if you don't know what you're doing can be extremely risky to the health of your PC. And from then on you will need to uninstall and re install EA's anti cheat on every start up of this game. Once in game you'll find that despite your ultra expensive custom high end PC, the menus are extremely laggy and unresponsive. If you want to tab out of this game, be sure that when you tab in, to move your mouse cursor to the very top right of your screen and out the way, because this game cannot disable the mouse while playing so if the mouse is hovering over a certain menu icon, and you try to navigate with your controller instead, the game will simply bug out. So just from a technical stand point this game is already atrocious.  [b] Gameplay Issues [/b] The game should be advertised as arcade, not the hyper realistic game it markets to be with all these new motion captures, ball physics etc that mislead. The gameplay is arcade, plain and simple. Remember FIFA matches being 5/6 mins a half, [i] by default. [/i] Well this time the default is now 3 minutes a half, why? Because any longer, even on the highest difficulty, the score of the match will be 7-7 and you will be fighting against the game just to keep the score down to actually feel a sense of realism. Dribbling is so stupid I can't even put it into words, players are on ice here, no studs in the ground, every player has 1000 agility, because the way they chop and turn and dribble makes no sense, not even Messi can dribble like this in real life, and this is amplified against the AI on any high difficulty, you will not get the ball for at least 2.5 minutes of the 3 minute half because their dribbling is simply uncontrollable.  [b] Career Mode [/b] We all know career mode has been on the decline in forever, which every new feature either breaking the game or being pointless, the dynamic sim feature where you watch dots play like its FM needs so much work, its so bare bones and you will always need to jump in to save your side losing. The new highlight mode is complete garbage with only having a select few highlights, so once you've seen and played a few, you've played them all, and the scenarios get extremely repetitive because of this. Transfers get a transfer rating and whoever rating your business literally has 0 business sense, and you'll likely get sacked for making good business, not to mention you can't loan players out because every loan offer is a loan to buy with a stupid price that can't be negotiated without the deal falling through. All in all another stinker for career mode.  [b] Online [/b] I never got round to playing online as I spent all of my short time in this game troubleshooting and trying to fix the offline game play with various slider settings. But I can imagine the arcade feel of this game translates well to an online simplified experience where you do ridiculous skill moves and score plenty of goals. FUT mode is absolutely packed with features and I would recommend this mode if you have plenty of money you want to spend on getting the best players and items.  [b] Conclusion [/b] I have played FIFA all my life, since FIFA 2004, growing up with the game, buying it every year and without fail playing hundreds of hours. FIFA 17 onwards my hours declined as did the game, but it was still playable up until this release. I can't understand how this game was even able to release in the technical state its in and I genuinely can't believe the huge decline this franchise has gone on over the past half a decade. I'm extremely disappointed. But this game really shows EA for what they are, with extreme amounts of income, can't even spend on the resources to make this game actually playable, its a complete ripoff of all its fans and the kids that spend serious amounts of money on FUT every year, and everyone who has bought this game year in year out faithfully to play career mode.  Utter disaster, don't purchase this game.  [h1] 0/10 [/h1]"

124971934,english,0,1811260,"I've played this around 200 hours. I was elite division in the previous game, have played games professionally throughout multiple platforms. Hands down without a shadow of a doubt this is the worst game i have ever played, if you want to feel like you are being completely robbed out of any competitive experience throughout the whole game then this is the game for you. It seems to me this is another case of great idea yet with a terrible, unreliable and straight up horror of a company executing it.   Short list of my major issues with this game. - Majority of defending is automatic in this game so normal through balls are basically magnet practice for the defenders (My own players included doing unbelievable and quite frankly impossible tackles without me pressing a button) - Passing is a joke and could go anywhere at any random moment. - Someone can press one button and make the game unplayable with man marking and pressing tactics. - Ballon d'or level players heavy touching the ball, not being able to even control a simple pass. - Sometimes the ball resembles that of the black out ball from men in black. - Tackle someone multiple times to watch the ball magnet back into one of the oppositions players  - Visibly being able to see my players get held back/ handicapped from going for the ball.  I could honestly make these stupidly long, there is so many more game play issues.  I'm not one for conspiracy theories but the DDA thing that everyone raves about seems quite visible in my eyes, some kind of momentum system built into the game or it could be the game play is that bad its turned a large portion of this community to even think it exists. On top of that they basically have a gambling system built into the game to scrape as much money as they possibly can even being visible to kids and vulnerable people.  I hope they never get another FIFA contract, should be a criminal act to release a £60 game in this state. I have never wrote a review on a game in my life but this one has angered me too the point where if i can save one person from buying this game it would be worth it.  Edit: People asking why i keep playing. I play the WL for coins and every time i do it makes me so angry to a point that no human being should ever feel like from playing a video game, the other time is just sat in the menus wishing the game was fun. Follow suit if you enjoy mental torture."
135952786,english,0,1811260,"After more than 6 months, the game still doesn't work. In the beginning, the game wouldn't launch in the EA launcher. I think it was some sort of ""verification problem."" Now the game won't launch and it's telling me that I'm not connected to the internet, even though I can see my friends on the EA launcher.  Steam refuses to issue a refund because I ""used some sort of in game content,"" or whatever. Maybe it's because I got the Ultimate Edition. I've never actually successfully loaded this game... but Steam says I've used some sort of in-game content? What a scam.  I've checked online, and this is a very common problem. I've literally spent hours trying to fix it. I waited for several patches, done the dns flush, the admin mode ""fix,"" the reset the cache on the EA app, changed the certificates on certain files... everything you can imagine. No dice. I just tried recently, thinking that the patches may have ironed things out and now it appears as though there are new problems. But the result is the same, and the game still won't launch.  It's really sickening that EA can sell games that won't even launch and get away with it, and Valve will deny refunds for them. It's honestly something should be settled with a class action suit.  All of my other EA games launch, like Battlefield 1. This one will go all the way to the Anti-Cheat screen (I don't even care about playing online) and then say my computer isn't connected to the internet.

I'm not experiencing the issues Windows 11 users are, and the game starts up just fine for me. That being said, this game has serious issues that shouldn't be present in a game that has basically followed the same formula for the past decade. It should be getting easier to get this stuff right, not harder.  1. On start up, I can't load my existing career save. The menu option just isn't there. To get around this I have to start a new career, and as soon as I'm able to, exit out. I'll then have the option to load my existing save.   I have to do this everytime I load up the game.  2. Not as serious, and probably for the best... I can't purchase FIFA points. I wanted to invest a small amount just to get started in FUT. Nope, constant error with the store. Just doesn't work, this is fine though, means EA don't get any more money from me, and I get to focus on career and other game modes.  3. Menu and UI glitches. Trying to manage multiple transfer requests at once is buggy as hell. Can't move up and down the list half the time. This issue is not limited to this menu, however this is where it is most annoying, as I have to constantly leave and re-enter.  Gameplay: It's fine, and the only thing about this game that seems to work as intended.

We all know the next game won't be FIFA, and we've also all known for a long time now that EA simply think very little of their player base, but we're also at fault. We buy the game year-in year-out because we love football and want to play football, but the problems with this game series isn't necessarily with the gameplay itself, otherwise we wouldn't play it. Our biggest issue is how EA treat us and how we let them get away with it every year.  With FIFA 23, I haven't had any issues while playing the game, but as all of us know, this game has problems opening, a lot, and it's down the anti-cheat that EA has implemented with this game. The anti-cheat has ruined this game for almost everyone. Everytime there's an update there's a new issue, a temporary fix, and the cycle repeats. Lately, I haven't been able to play the game for the longest period since I got it, but the consistent issues have pushed me beyond frustration.   I have played every entry in this series since FIFA 07, but I have never been this insulted by EA. I hope this game is the one that shows all of us players that they really, truly do not care.

The animations are good with the mo-cap, and the additional teams etc are nice.   HOWEVER.  Still can't play this game without having to perform programmer level shenanigans. EA-Anticheat is so broken, that even uninstalling it and reinstalling does nothing. You can't have any overlays on which sucks major donkey bolas for those of us that play and use discord, or even our cards overlay like Nvidia's.   It's SUPER unoptimized. maximum and medium settings run the same for my rig which runs most modern AAA titles on ultra or very high. CGI cutscenes are choppy. gameplay is sometimes choppy depending on how it feels and it all adds up to an experience that would make you a pendehoe playing it in it's current state.   I've tried getting a refund due to the dismal experience but they claim i can't because of the hours I have logged... Yes... Hours I have logged leaving the game open when I slept so I could still play without having to get a degree in computer engineering to get it to run.  If this still hasn't dissuaded you from purchasing this game, then wait until the game launch bugs are fixed or you're going to uninstall it out of frustration like I have.

126662256,english,0,1811260,"I've bought every single FIFA since 2016 and this is by far the worst. The amount of problems it has on PC is insane. Here's a list of some I encountered:  - Game doesn't start when I press play on Steam (I had to close Origin via Task Manager and try a few times)  - Once that works, it says that anticheat is already installed and crashes the moment the game opens (fixed by manually uninstalling their anticheat and reinstalling it, but it doesn't always work)  - Very high GPU usage and temperatures in the menus, much higher than when I'm actually in game. I have a good PC and no game has ever used this many resources. It runs at 144fps, but the temperatures and % usage is unacceptable.  - Limiting the game to 60fps via the graphics menu does not work since it's a Vsync setting (full or half frames) based on your monitor refresh rate. This is something that hasn't been fixed for a few years now.  Both this and gpu usage were fixed by changing graphics to low and limiting fps to 60 via Nvidia control panel.  Keep in mind that even if you manage to make the game work, it's not guaranteed to keep working in the future. The gameplay is also a considerable downgrade from last year, but some people like it so I suppose that's subjective. Overall, it's clear that they don't care about PC. The price is the same as console version though, so I expect the same quality.   I'll change my review if things improve, but that is very unlikely.  EDIT: As of 8 December (and a game update later), I am still encountering the same issues. Do not buy it regardless of price."

With the standard phrases like ''It's fun because it's a football game'', or ''You don't understand because you're not a football fan yourself''. But this is different. Way different.  FIFA 23 doesn't even work... It's now a week after release and some folks still aren't able to even launch the game, I have to start Origin in Administrator Mode for it to work, but at least I can play. That being said, servers are trash. They always were, but it's even worse this time. Navigating through the menu's feels buggy and rough around the edges, the game is poorly optimized, and they even haven't fixed some issues that were in FIFA 22, which is astonishing to me.  But now for the most important part, the gameplay. This is where FIFA 23 has it's occasional shine. PC-Players finally got Next-Gen after being completely ignored with FIFA 22 last year. While playing the game, you can feel the game isn't as arcade-like anymore. It's much more slow-paced, and you have to actually think about your next move or pass on the pitch. On the other hand, the AI is mind-blowingly dumb... Players are standing still when the ball rolls past them 15 centimetres away from their feet. Or suddenly your attacker cancels his run past the last defender, which is incredibly frustrating. And maybe the most ridiculous and game-breaking one, if you play against the AI, for example in Career Mode or Squad Battles, the opponent's goalkeeper can't even receive a pass... Like seriously, they are scoring own-goals like it's nothing.  Some new features like the Power Shots are fun and make for some absolute bangers, but the game overall is underwhelming. This combined with the fact that some people that paid 70 or 80 bucks (!!!) can't even start up the game, gave me the feeling I should write a review for this 5/10 game. For now, stay far away from it.  Congratulations EA, you've made the last FIFA, the worst FIFA."

From the endlessly frustrating gameplay to the buggy and glitchy graphics, it's clear that the developers put a lot of time and effort into making sure this game was as terrible as possible.  But let's talk about the real star of the show: the AI. Wow, what a thrill it is to be completely outclassed by the computer at every turn. It's almost as if the game was designed specifically to make the player feel completely helpless and incompetent. And let's not forget about the matchmaking system, which always manages to pair me up with players who are significantly more skilled than I am. It's like a never-ending cycle of misery and disappointment.  But the worst part has to be the microtransactions. I mean, who doesn't love spending their hard-earned money on virtual players that are completely and utterly useless? It's a great feeling to know that I can spend real money on a game that is already so overpriced, just to have a slightly better chance at winning.  Overall, I can't recommend FIFA 23 enough.

The game wont feel like it's worth the full amount as it is a Fifa 22 re-skin. However, it still is a solid pick up for the offer and you wont feel let down. After so long the game looks better on PC and the gameplay is solid too. Defending feels way less sloppy and keepers are more closer to their human counterparts. Attacking can be done cleverly and defenders no longer catch up to you as pace ratings play a more important role atleast from what i have experienced. That said, the game isnt completely bug free with occasional glitches popping up even in my short span of play but it isnt cyberpunk level broken. I obviously do not support the way EA milks the FIFA series but this game definitely deserves a slightly better rating. As for anyone experiencing frame drops, turning off dynamic resolution helped fix that issue for me."

123078531,english,0,1811260,"STEAM DECK USERS can't play FIFA 23 on the deck because of the EA kernel-level anti-cheat software that detects Proton / SteamOS as ""hacks"", sort of. The only way to have it working is installing Windows 10 on the deck, which is bad news cause the overall performance gets worsened on the deck with Windows.   And why does it even have a kernel-level anti-cheat, if the FUT transfer market isn't shared with us PC players? If you're on console, the market is shared between ALL the consoles: ps4, ps5, X1, XsX & XsS. But we PC players are excluded & can only trade between us.  A kernel-level anti-cheat has way higher privileges then it should & having it installed is like having a hole in your PC's security that can be exploited by viruses. Now have in mind EA will be on charge... what could go wrong? [url=https://youtu.be/PY41wMvwrLQ?t=221] Here's a video explaining this & its consequences in depth. [/url]   Putting that aside: This game lays off a foundation on which they should build upon in the following game. It's a step in the right direction compared with the last title, since at least now we got Hypermotion2 & crossplat for the first time in PC, but sadly there are aspects to improve (+ tons of bugs).   [list] [*]You can't play Volta online with your friends like you play online friendlies, leaving a massive mode (volta) to be played only against bots. Horrible decision.  [*]If you enable ""listen to music while on gameplay"" [spoiler](which allows you to listen to FIFA songs INSTEAD of the commentators)[/spoiler] you WON'T be able to skip songs while you're playing a match & you'll have to wait until the match is finished in order to skip the song. Also, no songs in online modes. For some reason is just plain silence for me.  [*] EA has DISABLED [url=https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay?snr=1_7_7_230#together]""Remote Play Together""[/url], so you won't be able to invite your friends & play remotely, instead each one of you will have to pay $60. (Note that game publishers in Steam have the ability to enable or disable this). [*]The mouse cursor hides itself at the center of the screen but in some instances it's still functional, meaning that if you're trying to select an option located on the edges, it won't let you & you'll think your controller is unresponsive, but is just the invisible mouse in the middle. So you'll have to move it away in order to be able to select the other options. You can reproduce this issue going into FUT > Moments.  [*]If you have 2 controllers & want to play split-screen, both players should use the same button layout. None of you can use different control settings because if one is different, it will overwrite the other player controller settings.  [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/qjt7sk/xbox_series_x_fifa_22_second_controller_settings/]This happens to some users since FIFA 21 across all platforms,[/url] yet it has never been addressed by EA, which tells us they only care about FUT.  [*]After scoring a goal, the ball keeps rolling even if the player takes it with their hands as a celebration.  [*]The ""classic"" button scheme has been remapped, which doesn't affect me but I'm just mentioning it for those who care: [b]LB+RB[/b] has been changed to ""power shot"". To execute a ""Low Driven shot"" you should gently press [b]B[/b] and release it asap. [b]LT+B[/b] does an outside foot shot if you're running.

So you should go try it. If 10hs aren't enough, you can buy EA Play Pro ($15 a month) & you'll get to play the whole game for 30 days, all the hours you want. Personally I would recommend waiting till the game hits $30, only then I'd buy it."

131521491,english,0,1811260,"I have hundreds of hours on older titles mostly on the Ultimate team mode and i could easily say do not buy this game. It's beyond broken on PC and i will point out everything bad me or my friends saw after 130+ hours on it.   I will start with the few positives about it so i can give credit where i can. - Career mode is fun and well done and most likely the only mode where you will enjoy the game.  - Pro clubs is okay and Online Seasons too.   - Fun to play with friends (when it works).    And here are the negatives.  - First and the most important it's a gamble if the game would even start because the anti-cheat is so broken and after every patch there is some kind of problem that you need to fix for it to run and it's just a joke EA doesn't bother doing something about it after so many months.  - The PC version of the game is not optimized at all compared to the next gen on console's it uses a lot of CPU for no reason. Even if you are in the menu browsing and doing something you could still feel the slight delay especially compared to older FIFA's. - Graphics on PC aren't good even on maximum settings.  - Connection is again awful in most of the game modes especially in FUT which is unacceptable for a company that makes so much money every year and doesn't buy any proper good servers. - This is something that happens to a friend of mine and i've heard it happens to a lot of people as well, when you open packs in FUT if there is a high rated walkout player the game crashes (He is with an Amd graphics card it seems there is no problem with the Nvidia ones)  - If you make a custom settings for your controller the game resets it all the time for no reason so you have to pause during the match and do them again which gets super annoying.  - Compared to older Fifa's they made huge FUT events like Team of the year for example which is running right now awful for the players making SBC's drain your coin balance and make you give more players than you get in return which just forces you to buy more and more Fifa points to keep up.  -  A big reason for me to buy this game was the new Cross-play they promoted so much and the Cross-Market in FUT but guess what? You can only play FUT friendlies with a person who has a console, You can't play seasons , Pro club , Co-op or anything fun. FUT market is also not cross platform for PC for absolutely no reason (only PlayStation and Xbox share market now) - And now the most annoying thing in the game in my opinion is the Scripted gameplay in Ultimate team mode and what i mean by this is the game makes you lose. It doesn't matter how good of a player you are the game will make you lose against worse players than you. You will hit the Goalpost nonstop the ball will randomly drop in the enemy player's foot , after tackles the ball will stay in him, you can have expected goals 5 and your opponent can have 0.9 but still he will win 3-2 against you and this usually happens in matches you really need to win for FUT champions or draft.   Seriously don't buy this game and don't give EA money if you really really want to play it just buy it on a next gen console on a big sale or have someone gift it to you other than that you will hate yourself for wasting your money for buying another EA game which is completely broken."

Ok then, - after some googleing I came accross some solutions that mentioned issues with the anti-cheat, so followed all those, but none worked. Ok sure, I'll turn on Secure boot then purely for Fifa as I generally think the games are worth it.

Edit2: After every update you will have to go through a couple of steps to get it to work AGAIN... otherwise the game does not start at all (even though it says it's running on Steam).

However, it felt like I was playing the same game as last year, with very little added innovation or changes.  The graphics and animations were also underwhelming. In an age where other games are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of graphics, FIFA 23 felt outdated and unimpressive. Additionally, I experienced several audio glitches and poor sound quality, which made the overall experience quite frustrating.  To make matters worse, the game had numerous bugs and glitches that affected gameplay. These issues were so severe that I lost progress and, in some cases, lost matches. It was quite frustrating and took away from the enjoyment of the game.  Finally, I have to say that the pay-to-win elements were really disappointing. It felt like the game was designed to force players to spend money to progress and improve, which really took away from the sense of accomplishment that comes with mastering a game through hard work and dedication.  Overall, I have to say that FIFA 23 fell short of my expectations. It lacked innovation, had outdated graphics and animations, and was plagued by bugs and glitches.

Not happy with that, since it clearly is a useless piece of garbage that doesn't actually prevent cheating, they decide to randomly block Virtual Machines YEARS AFTER THE GAME HAS BEEN RELEASED.  I have played 126h all of which using a VM with GPU passthrough. Why? Because I will not allow such malware to run on a Windows installation where I keep my own data. And neither should anyone, really, considering the risks this software poses if hacked.  So either allow turning off the anticheat to play in offline mode! Or, JUST REFUND THE RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE GAME as this is essentially a breach of contract.  EDIT: my hours went up because I found a workaround. If a guy like me can find a workaround why even having the AC running in the first place?"
130591734,english,1,1811260,"CAREER MODE PLAYER REVIEW:  When i first bought this I had problems with settings not saving, turned out to be I had multiple controllers plugged into my PC and everytime I loaded up it reset settings for a new controller. Easy fix, only have one main controller in.   I haven't played since Fifa 17 on the good 'ol Xbox 360 and recently bought Fifa 22 which I was blown away with. Fifa 23 being 45% off I bought it and well, I'm generally impressed. The PC graphics from 22 to 23 have improved tenfold, new animations and the gameplay generally is more realistic in my opinion. I feel as though I'm rewarded for scoring against AI.  THE AI:  Bloody AI is so unpredictable you have a League 2 team starting to be prime barca with the passing. Easy fix, sliders. Other than the occasional ""wtf"" goal, it's not too bad out of the box.   70/100 recommend to a career player.  I've been lucky and haven't experienced any glitches which makes me upset. To each their own. Enjoy the game lads!"

125456831,english,0,1811260,"Some improvement over the last edition I played (2021), but the biggest edge hasn't been smoothed. Probably my last EA soccer game.  [b]Frostbitten[/b] The game's biggest strength has also been it's biggest weakness for years. The Frostbite engine has put in place hundreds if not thousands of flexible animations which allow play to branch at every possible angle creating beautiful, dynamic gameplay. The cost for this is [i]the game putting ~5 yard radius force-fields around players[/i] immediately on the ball making closing down players incredibly and unnecessarily difficult. The close down option is insufficient for higher level play and using the jockey button sends you out of position if the ball handler does pretty much anything (I think the game assumes that you were faked out by whatever they did, even if they slightly changed pace in the direction that you are going).  [b]Player Career Mode[/b] Player career mode still has issues. I had my controller disconnect mid-match. When I reconnected, the game assumed that I switched teams and prevented any achievement progress. Much worse, [i]the camera stopped acknowledging my existence[/i] to instead focus only on the ball. The team I was playing for also loved swapping my position mid-play (Could be minute 80, could be minute 25). While poor form in itself, the fact that [i]nothing on screen acknowledged the change[/i] caused confusion and multiple out of position rating deductions. It is not uncommon for this to happen multiple times in a game, adding a layer of frustration and paranoia to my favorite game mode.  [b]Miscellaneous Feel Bads[/b] Launching the game feels like a chore with the long anti-cheat pre-load section which also triggers multiple system yes/no alert prompts. The UX also feels unresponsive at times with the UI sometimes waiting seconds between user action and any on-screen acknowledgement (Audio or visual). Not sure if this is because the UI is trying to process and show too much information or if there is a threading issue, but the UI is too slick looking for the game to not at least trigger a sound effect when the user performs a menu action.  [b]Bright Spots[/b] There are some bright spots. The menus continue to get prettier and more streamlined. When the force-fields are down, there is a lot of fun to be had in the close quarters dueling, especially on offense. The overall gameplay continues to feel a bit more fluid. Making money relevant in player career mode as well as having personality choices are a welcome change, even if they don't seem to have much of an effect on play.  [b]It's Time[/b] I have enjoyed the game for decades, but fighting against both the other team and the engine to play good defense continues to be a very frustrating experience. It's been an issue for years, and it's not changing in any meaningful way. Couple that with the menu and career issues and playing the game becomes tiring. I'm exhausted. I'm done. It was a good run, but goodbye FIFA/EA Sports FC. I think it's time that I move on."

Any and all combinations of the above does not work.  Requested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.  Game won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.   UPDATE:  Filed a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund.   So, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.

I still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam.

127633672,english,0,1811260,"[h1] The biggest fall from grace I have ever seen [/h1]  [b] Technical Issues [/b] If you buy this game you might not be able to start it like the majority of people as you will see in other reviews. In order to start this game you will firstly need to enter your BIOS, on your high end PC, and change some settings, which if you don't know what you're doing can be extremely risky to the health of your PC. And from then on you will need to uninstall and re install EA's anti cheat on every start up of this game. Once in game you'll find that despite your ultra expensive custom high end PC, the menus are extremely laggy and unresponsive. If you want to tab out of this game, be sure that when you tab in, to move your mouse cursor to the very top right of your screen and out the way, because this game cannot disable the mouse while playing so if the mouse is hovering over a certain menu icon, and you try to navigate with your controller instead, the game will simply bug out. So just from a technical stand point this game is already atrocious.  [b] Gameplay Issues [/b] The game should be advertised as arcade, not the hyper realistic game it markets to be with all these new motion captures, ball physics etc that mislead. The gameplay is arcade, plain and simple. Remember FIFA matches being 5/6 mins a half, [i] by default. [/i] Well this time the default is now 3 minutes a half, why? Because any longer, even on the highest difficulty, the score of the match will be 7-7 and you will be fighting against the game just to keep the score down to actually feel a sense of realism. Dribbling is so stupid I can't even put it into words, players are on ice here, no studs in the ground, every player has 1000 agility, because the way they chop and turn and dribble makes no sense, not even Messi can dribble like this in real life, and this is amplified against the AI on any high difficulty, you will not get the ball for at least 2.5 minutes of the 3 minute half because their dribbling is simply uncontrollable.  [b] Career Mode [/b] We all know career mode has been on the decline in forever, which every new feature either breaking the game or being pointless, the dynamic sim feature where you watch dots play like its FM needs so much work, its so bare bones and you will always need to jump in to save your side losing. The new highlight mode is complete garbage with only having a select few highlights, so once you've seen and played a few, you've played them all, and the scenarios get extremely repetitive because of this. Transfers get a transfer rating and whoever rating your business literally has 0 business sense, and you'll likely get sacked for making good business, not to mention you can't loan players out because every loan offer is a loan to buy with a stupid price that can't be negotiated without the deal falling through. All in all another stinker for career mode.  [b] Online [/b] I never got round to playing online as I spent all of my short time in this game troubleshooting and trying to fix the offline game play with various slider settings. But I can imagine the arcade feel of this game translates well to an online simplified experience where you do ridiculous skill moves and score plenty of goals. FUT mode is absolutely packed with features and I would recommend this mode if you have plenty of money you want to spend on getting the best players and items.  [b] Conclusion [/b] I have played FIFA all my life, since FIFA 2004, growing up with the game, buying it every year and without fail playing hundreds of hours. FIFA 17 onwards my hours declined as did the game, but it was still playable up until this release. I can't understand how this game was even able to release in the technical state its in and I genuinely can't believe the huge decline this franchise has gone on over the past half a decade. I'm extremely disappointed. But this game really shows EA for what they are, with extreme amounts of income, can't even spend on the resources to make this game actually playable, its a complete ripoff of all its fans and the kids that spend serious amounts of money on FUT every year, and everyone who has bought this game year in year out faithfully to play career mode.  Utter disaster, don't purchase this game.  [h1] 0/10 [/h1]"

124971934,english,0,1811260,"I've played this around 200 hours. I was elite division in the previous game, have played games professionally throughout multiple platforms. Hands down without a shadow of a doubt this is the worst game i have ever played, if you want to feel like you are being completely robbed out of any competitive experience throughout the whole game then this is the game for you. It seems to me this is another case of great idea yet with a terrible, unreliable and straight up horror of a company executing it.   Short list of my major issues with this game. - Majority of defending is automatic in this game so normal through balls are basically magnet practice for the defenders (My own players included doing unbelievable and quite frankly impossible tackles without me pressing a button) - Passing is a joke and could go anywhere at any random moment. - Someone can press one button and make the game unplayable with man marking and pressing tactics. - Ballon d'or level players heavy touching the ball, not being able to even control a simple pass. - Sometimes the ball resembles that of the black out ball from men in black. - Tackle someone multiple times to watch the ball magnet back into one of the oppositions players  - Visibly being able to see my players get held back/ handicapped from going for the ball.  I could honestly make these stupidly long, there is so many more game play issues.  I'm not one for conspiracy theories but the DDA thing that everyone raves about seems quite visible in my eyes, some kind of momentum system built into the game or it could be the game play is that bad its turned a large portion of this community to even think it exists. On top of that they basically have a gambling system built into the game to scrape as much money as they possibly can even being visible to kids and vulnerable people.  I hope they never get another FIFA contract, should be a criminal act to release a £60 game in this state. I have never wrote a review on a game in my life but this one has angered me too the point where if i can save one person from buying this game it would be worth it.  Edit: People asking why i keep playing. I play the WL for coins and every time i do it makes me so angry to a point that no human being should ever feel like from playing a video game, the other time is just sat in the menus wishing the game was fun. Follow suit if you enjoy mental torture."

I think it was some sort of ""verification problem."" Now the game won't launch and it's telling me that I'm not connected to the internet, even though I can see my friends on the EA launcher.  Steam refuses to issue a refund because I ""used some sort of in game content,"" or whatever. Maybe it's because I got the Ultimate Edition. I've never actually successfully loaded this game... but Steam says I've used some sort of in-game content? What a scam.  I've checked online, and this is a very common problem. I've literally spent hours trying to fix it. I waited for several patches, done the dns flush, the admin mode ""fix,"" the reset the cache on the EA app, changed the certificates on certain files... everything you can imagine. No dice. I just tried recently, thinking that the patches may have ironed things out and now it appears as though there are new problems. But the result is the same, and the game still won't launch.  It's really sickening that EA can sell games that won't even launch and get away with it, and Valve will deny refunds for them. It's honestly something should be settled with a class action suit.  All of my other EA games launch, like Battlefield 1. This one will go all the way to the Anti-Cheat screen (I don't even care about playing online) and then say my computer isn't connected to the internet.

I'm not experiencing the issues Windows 11 users are, and the game starts up just fine for me. That being said, this game has serious issues that shouldn't be present in a game that has basically followed the same formula for the past decade. It should be getting easier to get this stuff right, not harder.  1. On start up, I can't load my existing career save. The menu option just isn't there. To get around this I have to start a new career, and as soon as I'm able to, exit out. I'll then have the option to load my existing save.   I have to do this everytime I load up the game.  2. Not as serious, and probably for the best... I can't purchase FIFA points. I wanted to invest a small amount just to get started in FUT. Nope, constant error with the store. Just doesn't work, this is fine though, means EA don't get any more money from me, and I get to focus on career and other game modes.  3. Menu and UI glitches. Trying to manage multiple transfer requests at once is buggy as hell. Can't move up and down the list half the time. This issue is not limited to this menu, however this is where it is most annoying, as I have to constantly leave and re-enter.  Gameplay: It's fine, and the only thing about this game that seems to work as intended. It's a bit slower, but FIFA over the years changes it's focus from time to time when it comes to gameplay and the rest of us just have to adjust.  It's abundantly clear that EA don't give a **** about this game on PC."

Our biggest issue is how EA treat us and how we let them get away with it every year.  With FIFA 23, I haven't had any issues while playing the game, but as all of us know, this game has problems opening, a lot, and it's down the anti-cheat that EA has implemented with this game.

I have a good PC and no game has ever used this many resources. It runs at 144fps, but the temperatures and % usage is unacceptable.  - Limiting the game to 60fps via the graphics menu does not work since it's a Vsync setting (full or half frames) based on your monitor refresh rate. This is something that hasn't been fixed for a few years now.  Both this and gpu usage were fixed by changing graphics to low and limiting fps to 60 via Nvidia control panel.  Keep in mind that even if you manage to make the game work, it's not guaranteed to keep working in the future. The gameplay is also a considerable downgrade from last year, but some people like it so I suppose that's subjective. Overall, it's clear that they don't care about PC. The price is the same as console version though, so I expect the same quality.   I'll change my review if things improve, but that is very unlikely.

FIFA 23 doesn't even work... It's now a week after release and some folks still aren't able to even launch the game, I have to start Origin in Administrator Mode for it to work, but at least I can play. That being said, servers are trash. They always were, but it's even worse this time. Navigating through the menu's feels buggy and rough around the edges, the game is poorly optimized, and they even haven't fixed some issues that were in FIFA 22, which is astonishing to me.  But now for the most important part, the gameplay. This is where FIFA 23 has it's occasional shine. PC-Players finally got Next-Gen after being completely ignored with FIFA 22 last year. While playing the game, you can feel the game isn't as arcade-like anymore. It's much more slow-paced, and you have to actually think about your next move or pass on the pitch. On the other hand, the AI is mind-blowingly dumb... Players are standing still when the ball rolls past them 15 centimetres away from their feet. Or suddenly your attacker cancels his run past the last defender, which is incredibly frustrating. And maybe the most ridiculous and game-breaking one, if you play against the AI, for example in Career Mode or Squad Battles, the opponent's goalkeeper can't even receive a pass... Like seriously, they are scoring own-goals like it's nothing.  Some new features like the Power Shots are fun and make for some absolute bangers, but the game overall is underwhelming. This combined with the fact that some people that paid 70 or 80 bucks (!!!) can't even start up the game, gave me the feeling I should write a review for this 5/10 game.

But let's talk about the real star of the show: the AI. Wow, what a thrill it is to be completely outclassed by the computer at every turn. It's almost as if the game was designed specifically to make the player feel completely helpless and incompetent. And let's not forget about the matchmaking system, which always manages to pair me up with players who are significantly more skilled than I am. It's like a never-ending cycle of misery and disappointment.  But the worst part has to be the microtransactions. I mean, who doesn't love spending their hard-earned money on virtual players that are completely and utterly useless? It's a great feeling to know that I can spend real money on a game that is already so overpriced, just to have a slightly better chance at winning.  Overall, I can't recommend FIFA 23 enough.

The game wont feel like it's worth the full amount as it is a Fifa 22 re-skin. However, it still is a solid pick up for the offer and you wont feel let down. After so long the game looks better on PC and the gameplay is solid too. Defending feels way less sloppy and keepers are more closer to their human counterparts. Attacking can be done cleverly and defenders no longer catch up to you as pace ratings play a more important role atleast from what i have experienced. That said, the game isnt completely bug free with occasional glitches popping up even in my short span of play but it isnt cyberpunk level broken. I obviously do not support the way EA milks the FIFA series but this game definitely deserves a slightly better rating.

[*]After scoring a goal, the ball keeps rolling even if the player takes it with their hands as a celebration.  [*]The ""classic"" button scheme has been remapped, which doesn't affect me but I'm just mentioning it for those who care: [b]LB+RB[/b] has been changed to ""power shot"". To execute a ""Low Driven shot"" you should gently press [b]B[/b] and release it asap. [b]LT+B[/b] does an outside foot shot if you're running.  [*]Sometimes your controller & camera settings won't get saved after closing & opening the game, it's a pain having to set it up every single times. [*]Australia women's national team has been removed.  [/list]  There's a 10-hour trial of this new FIFA 23 on [url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass]Xbox PC GamePass ($1 the 1st month)[/url], & the whole game will be added to PC GamePass 7-9 months after its launch day (May-July 2023) like when they've added Fifa 22. So you should go try it. If 10hs aren't enough, you can buy EA Play Pro ($15 a month) & you'll get to play the whole game for 30 days, all the hours you want. Personally I would recommend waiting till the game hits $30, only then I'd buy it."

HARD WAY: When you received the security boot problem, you can reboot your PC and go to the motherboard settings/advanced and turn it on. Then you will receive: This software cannot be used at same time as the game. please make sure it's not running, or restart your pc.: security violation (262146) If this error mentioned ""Hypervisor"", you have to go to the configuration of your PC and disable it, if the error was as long as mine without mentioing a program, then i have found no solution for it but don't worry, still it can be solved in the easy way.   *After finding a solutions i asked my self: how much EA did cared for the last FIFA game they released and after almost a year to have time to at least solve the launch problems. so suddently i found the easy way solution.

131521491,english,0,1811260,"I have hundreds of hours on older titles mostly on the Ultimate team mode and i could easily say do not buy this game. It's beyond broken on PC and i will point out everything bad me or my friends saw after 130+ hours on it.   I will start with the few positives about it so i can give credit where i can. - Career mode is fun and well done and most likely the only mode where you will enjoy the game.  - Pro clubs is okay and Online Seasons too.   - Fun to play with friends (when it works).    And here are the negatives.  - First and the most important it's a gamble if the game would even start because the anti-cheat is so broken and after every patch there is some kind of problem that you need to fix for it to run and it's just a joke EA doesn't bother doing something about it after so many months.  - The PC version of the game is not optimized at all compared to the next gen on console's it uses a lot of CPU for no reason. Even if you are in the menu browsing and doing something you could still feel the slight delay especially compared to older FIFA's. - Graphics on PC aren't good even on maximum settings.  - Connection is again awful in most of the game modes especially in FUT which is unacceptable for a company that makes so much money every year and doesn't buy any proper good servers. - This is something that happens to a friend of mine and i've heard it happens to a lot of people as well, when you open packs in FUT if there is a high rated walkout player the game crashes (He is with an Amd graphics card it seems there is no problem with the Nvidia ones)  - If you make a custom settings for your controller the game resets it all the time for no reason so you have to pause during the match and do them again which gets super annoying.  - Compared to older Fifa's they made huge FUT events like Team of the year for example which is running right now awful for the players making SBC's drain your coin balance and make you give more players than you get in return which just forces you to buy more and more Fifa points to keep up.  -  A big reason for me to buy this game was the new Cross-play they promoted so much and the Cross-Market in FUT but guess what? You can only play FUT friendlies with a person who has a console, You can't play seasons , Pro club , Co-op or anything fun. FUT market is also not cross platform for PC for absolutely no reason (only PlayStation and Xbox share market now) - And now the most annoying thing in the game in my opinion is the Scripted gameplay in Ultimate team mode and what i mean by this is the game makes you lose. It doesn't matter how good of a player you are the game will make you lose against worse players than you. You will hit the Goalpost nonstop the ball will randomly drop in the enemy player's foot , after tackles the ball will stay in him, you can have expected goals 5 and your opponent can have 0.9 but still he will win 3-2 against you and this usually happens in matches you really need to win for FUT champions or draft.   Seriously don't buy this game and don't give EA money if you really really want to play it just buy it on a next gen console on a big sale or have someone gift it to you other than that you will hate yourself for wasting your money for buying another EA game which is completely broken."

Never had these issues in all past Fifa's I have played and thought the bad reviews were a bit over the top, until I bought it and the first thing that greeted me was ""Secure boot not enabled""... Ok then, - after some googleing I came accross some solutions that mentioned issues with the anti-cheat, so followed all those, but none worked. Ok sure, I'll turn on Secure boot then purely for Fifa as I generally think the games are worth it. After that the game finally ""started"" but got stuck on the startup screen with 3000fps and my GPU going haywire.. tried a couple times and gave up as I didn't feel like troubleshooting even more then I already spent JUST TO GET THE GAME STARTED. Refunded, what a buggy mess, even before getting in-game. Do not buy on PC, unless they get rid of the ridiculous anti-cheat that causes most of these issues. DO NOT BUY ON PC.   -> Edit1: Gave it some more troubleshooting and put a manual FPS limit on the game - so the startup-screen is now locked at 165hz from my monitor, and it did eventually start. Still not recommended unless you are willing to go through the trouble to get it to work.  Edit2: After every update you will have to go through a couple of steps to get it to work AGAIN... otherwise the game does not start at all (even though it says it's running on Steam). This has to do (still) with the anti-cheat, you will have to go through some trouble with installing certificates and manually updating the anti-cheat client. Maybe some day they will fix it, but for now still really NOT recommended!"

133133805,english,0,1811260,"I was quite disappointed with EA SPORTS™ FIFA 23, to be honest. As a longtime fan of the series, I was expecting some significant improvements and exciting new features. However, it felt like I was playing the same game as last year, with very little added innovation or changes.  The graphics and animations were also underwhelming. In an age where other games are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of graphics, FIFA 23 felt outdated and unimpressive. Additionally, I experienced several audio glitches and poor sound quality, which made the overall experience quite frustrating.  To make matters worse, the game had numerous bugs and glitches that affected gameplay. These issues were so severe that I lost progress and, in some cases, lost matches. It was quite frustrating and took away from the enjoyment of the game.  Finally, I have to say that the pay-to-win elements were really disappointing. It felt like the game was designed to force players to spend money to progress and improve, which really took away from the sense of accomplishment that comes with mastering a game through hard work and dedication.  Overall, I have to say that FIFA 23 fell short of my expectations. It lacked innovation, had outdated graphics and animations, and was plagued by bugs and glitches. The pay-to-win elements were also a significant downside, and I can't say that I enjoyed the overall experience."

Easy fix, only have one main controller in.   I haven't played since Fifa 17 on the good 'ol Xbox 360 and recently bought Fifa 22 which I was blown away with. Fifa 23 being 45% off I bought it and well, I'm generally impressed. The PC graphics from 22 to 23 have improved tenfold, new animations and the gameplay generally is more realistic in my opinion. I feel as though I'm rewarded for scoring against AI.  THE AI:  Bloody AI is so unpredictable you have a League 2 team starting to be prime barca with the passing. Easy fix, sliders. Other than the occasional ""wtf"" goal, it's not too bad out of the box.   70/100 recommend to a career player.  I've been lucky and haven't experienced any glitches which makes me upset.

Minor changes from game to game, but the old errors, bugs and crutches remain.  As if the developers need 2 parts of FIFA to fix 1 little bug. It's a laughing stigma for a company like this.  But as if that's not enough, the game continues to abound with a bunch of ****. Broken anti-cheat, which causes 75% of errors on launch, crashes and bugs in career mode that ruin save files, some strange [strike]s**t[/strike] with disconnects in the middle of matches.  And all this will not be fixed. Why? Because there are a million different colored cards of one and the same player from France, which will always drop you, once again giving you a momentary feeling of happiness that it may be Mbappé.  UT's Moments mode is cool. Thanks for that one, but everything else is...  Only in UT could it be that a golden ball winner's card is worse than a rookie's card, with speed and strikes boosted up."

I give up and if anyone reads this just do yourself, your wallet and your mental health a favour and don't buy this pile of fucking shit. The only consistency in this fucking mess is the lack of consistency, the running, the tackles, the passes, the shots it's just dogshit. Besides FUT being a cashgrab and its so called gameplay being ""totally accurate"" and reflecting the stats on the cards like William Carvalho catching up to Mbappe during a sprint or Jorge Campos (playing outfield) winning a header against VvD or even Insigne winning dribbling past Coates while being pressed by him. Not even Career Mode is safe, despite the player's stats are somewhat ""accurately"" represented, tthe ""gameplay"" itself is still aweful.

125456831,english,0,1811260,"Some improvement over the last edition I played (2021), but the biggest edge hasn't been smoothed. Probably my last EA soccer game.  [b]Frostbitten[/b] The game's biggest strength has also been it's biggest weakness for years. The Frostbite engine has put in place hundreds if not thousands of flexible animations which allow play to branch at every possible angle creating beautiful, dynamic gameplay. The cost for this is [i]the game putting ~5 yard radius force-fields around players[/i] immediately on the ball making closing down players incredibly and unnecessarily difficult. The close down option is insufficient for higher level play and using the jockey button sends you out of position if the ball handler does pretty much anything (I think the game assumes that you were faked out by whatever they did, even if they slightly changed pace in the direction that you are going).  [b]Player Career Mode[/b] Player career mode still has issues. I had my controller disconnect mid-match. When I reconnected, the game assumed that I switched teams and prevented any achievement progress. Much worse, [i]the camera stopped acknowledging my existence[/i] to instead focus only on the ball. The team I was playing for also loved swapping my position mid-play (Could be minute 80, could be minute 25). While poor form in itself, the fact that [i]nothing on screen acknowledged the change[/i] caused confusion and multiple out of position rating deductions. It is not uncommon for this to happen multiple times in a game, adding a layer of frustration and paranoia to my favorite game mode.  [b]Miscellaneous Feel Bads[/b] Launching the game feels like a chore with the long anti-cheat pre-load section which also triggers multiple system yes/no alert prompts. The UX also feels unresponsive at times with the UI sometimes waiting seconds between user action and any on-screen acknowledgement (Audio or visual). Not sure if this is because the UI is trying to process and show too much information or if there is a threading issue, but the UI is too slick looking for the game to not at least trigger a sound effect when the user performs a menu action.  [b]Bright Spots[/b] There are some bright spots. The menus continue to get prettier and more streamlined. When the force-fields are down, there is a lot of fun to be had in the close quarters dueling, especially on offense. The overall gameplay continues to feel a bit more fluid. Making money relevant in player career mode as well as having personality choices are a welcome change, even if they don't seem to have much of an effect on play.  [b]It's Time[/b] I have enjoyed the game for decades, but fighting against both the other team and the engine to play good defense continues to be a very frustrating experience. It's been an issue for years, and it's not changing in any meaningful way. Couple that with the menu and career issues and playing the game becomes tiring. I'm exhausted. I'm done. It was a good run, but goodbye FIFA/EA Sports FC. I think it's time that I move on."

EA made the same game from 2016 to 2023, with almost no new features, because they only care about ultimate team and nothing else, they farm money every year with almost no effort and they still cant make this game launch normally like any other game or even adding something new, at least this FIFA will be the last one made by this garbage moneygrabbing company so not everything about this game is bad."

Any and all combinations of the above does not work.  Requested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.  Game won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.   UPDATE:  Filed a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund.   So, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.  Also Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??

I still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again."
127633672,english,0,1811260,"[h1] The biggest fall from grace I have ever seen [/h1]  [b] Technical Issues [/b] If you buy this game you might not be able to start it like the majority of people as you will see in other reviews. In order to start this game you will firstly need to enter your BIOS, on your high end PC, and change some settings, which if you don't know what you're doing can be extremely risky to the health of your PC. And from then on you will need to uninstall and re install EA's anti cheat on every start up of this game. Once in game you'll find that despite your ultra expensive custom high end PC, the menus are extremely laggy and unresponsive. If you want to tab out of this game, be sure that when you tab in, to move your mouse cursor to the very top right of your screen and out the way, because this game cannot disable the mouse while playing so if the mouse is hovering over a certain menu icon, and you try to navigate with your controller instead, the game will simply bug out. So just from a technical stand point this game is already atrocious.  [b] Gameplay Issues [/b] The game should be advertised as arcade, not the hyper realistic game it markets to be with all these new motion captures, ball physics etc that mislead. The gameplay is arcade, plain and simple. Remember FIFA matches being 5/6 mins a half, [i] by default. [/i] Well this time the default is now 3 minutes a half, why? Because any longer, even on the highest difficulty, the score of the match will be 7-7 and you will be fighting against the game just to keep the score down to actually feel a sense of realism. Dribbling is so stupid I can't even put it into words, players are on ice here, no studs in the ground, every player has 1000 agility, because the way they chop and turn and dribble makes no sense, not even Messi can dribble like this in real life, and this is amplified against the AI on any high difficulty, you will not get the ball for at least 2.5 minutes of the 3 minute half because their dribbling is simply uncontrollable.  [b] Career Mode [/b] We all know career mode has been on the decline in forever, which every new feature either breaking the game or being pointless, the dynamic sim feature where you watch dots play like its FM needs so much work, its so bare bones and you will always need to jump in to save your side losing. The new highlight mode is complete garbage with only having a select few highlights, so once you've seen and played a few, you've played them all, and the scenarios get extremely repetitive because of this. Transfers get a transfer rating and whoever rating your business literally has 0 business sense, and you'll likely get sacked for making good business, not to mention you can't loan players out because every loan offer is a loan to buy with a stupid price that can't be negotiated without the deal falling through. All in all another stinker for career mode.  [b] Online [/b] I never got round to playing online as I spent all of my short time in this game troubleshooting and trying to fix the offline game play with various slider settings. But I can imagine the arcade feel of this game translates well to an online simplified experience where you do ridiculous skill moves and score plenty of goals. FUT mode is absolutely packed with features and I would recommend this mode if you have plenty of money you want to spend on getting the best players and items.  [b] Conclusion [/b] I have played FIFA all my life, since FIFA 2004, growing up with the game, buying it every year and without fail playing hundreds of hours. FIFA 17 onwards my hours declined as did the game, but it was still playable up until this release. I can't understand how this game was even able to release in the technical state its in and I genuinely can't believe the huge decline this franchise has gone on over the past half a decade. I'm extremely disappointed. But this game really shows EA for what they are, with extreme amounts of income, can't even spend on the resources to make this game actually playable, its a complete ripoff of all its fans and the kids that spend serious amounts of money on FUT every year, and everyone who has bought this game year in year out faithfully to play career mode.  Utter disaster, don't purchase this game.  [h1] 0/10 [/h1]"

124971934,english,0,1811260,"I've played this around 200 hours. I was elite division in the previous game, have played games professionally throughout multiple platforms. Hands down without a shadow of a doubt this is the worst game i have ever played, if you want to feel like you are being completely robbed out of any competitive experience throughout the whole game then this is the game for you. It seems to me this is another case of great idea yet with a terrible, unreliable and straight up horror of a company executing it.   Short list of my major issues with this game. - Majority of defending is automatic in this game so normal through balls are basically magnet practice for the defenders (My own players included doing unbelievable and quite frankly impossible tackles without me pressing a button) - Passing is a joke and could go anywhere at any random moment. - Someone can press one button and make the game unplayable with man marking and pressing tactics. - Ballon d'or level players heavy touching the ball, not being able to even control a simple pass. - Sometimes the ball resembles that of the black out ball from men in black. - Tackle someone multiple times to watch the ball magnet back into one of the oppositions players  - Visibly being able to see my players get held back/ handicapped from going for the ball.  I could honestly make these stupidly long, there is so many more game play issues.  I'm not one for conspiracy theories but the DDA thing that everyone raves about seems quite visible in my eyes, some kind of momentum system built into the game or it could be the game play is that bad its turned a large portion of this community to even think it exists. On top of that they basically have a gambling system built into the game to scrape as much money as they possibly can even being visible to kids and vulnerable people.  I hope they never get another FIFA contract, should be a criminal act to release a £60 game in this state. I have never wrote a review on a game in my life but this one has angered me too the point where if i can save one person from buying this game it would be worth it.  Edit: People asking why i keep playing. I play the WL for coins and every time i do it makes me so angry to a point that no human being should ever feel like from playing a video game, the other time is just sat in the menus wishing the game was fun. Follow suit if you enjoy mental torture."
135952786,english,0,1811260,"After more than 6 months, the game still doesn't work. In the beginning, the game wouldn't launch in the EA launcher. I think it was some sort of ""verification problem."" Now the game won't launch and it's telling me that I'm not connected to the internet, even though I can see my friends on the EA launcher.  Steam refuses to issue a refund because I ""used some sort of in game content,"" or whatever. Maybe it's because I got the Ultimate Edition. I've never actually successfully loaded this game... but Steam says I've used some sort of in-game content? What a scam.  I've checked online, and this is a very common problem. I've literally spent hours trying to fix it. I waited for several patches, done the dns flush, the admin mode ""fix,"" the reset the cache on the EA app, changed the certificates on certain files... everything you can imagine. No dice. I just tried recently, thinking that the patches may have ironed things out and now it appears as though there are new problems. But the result is the same, and the game still won't launch.  It's really sickening that EA can sell games that won't even launch and get away with it, and Valve will deny refunds for them. It's honestly something should be settled with a class action suit.  All of my other EA games launch, like Battlefield 1. This one will go all the way to the Anti-Cheat screen (I don't even care about playing online) and then say my computer isn't connected to the internet.

I'm not experiencing the issues Windows 11 users are, and the game starts up just fine for me. That being said, this game has serious issues that shouldn't be present in a game that has basically followed the same formula for the past decade. It should be getting easier to get this stuff right, not harder.  1. On start up, I can't load my existing career save. The menu option just isn't there. To get around this I have to start a new career, and as soon as I'm able to, exit out. I'll then have the option to load my existing save.   I have to do this everytime I load up the game.  2. Not as serious, and probably for the best... I can't purchase FIFA points. I wanted to invest a small amount just to get started in FUT. Nope, constant error with the store. Just doesn't work, this is fine though, means EA don't get any more money from me, and I get to focus on career and other game modes.  3. Menu and UI glitches. Trying to manage multiple transfer requests at once is buggy as hell. Can't move up and down the list half the time. This issue is not limited to this menu, however this is where it is most annoying, as I have to constantly leave and re-enter.  Gameplay: It's fine, and the only thing about this game that seems to work as intended.

Our biggest issue is how EA treat us and how we let them get away with it every year.  With FIFA 23, I haven't had any issues while playing the game, but as all of us know, this game has problems opening, a lot, and it's down the anti-cheat that EA has implemented with this game. The anti-cheat has ruined this game for almost everyone. Everytime there's an update there's a new issue, a temporary fix, and the cycle repeats. Lately, I haven't been able to play the game for the longest period since I got it, but the consistent issues have pushed me beyond frustration.   I have played every entry in this series since FIFA 07, but I have never been this insulted by EA. I hope this game is the one that shows all of us players that they really, truly do not care. And if they want to prove me wrong, put out a statement, address the fans, tell us what you're doing to fix this stuff."

The animations are good with the mo-cap, and the additional teams etc are nice.   HOWEVER.  Still can't play this game without having to perform programmer level shenanigans. EA-Anticheat is so broken, that even uninstalling it and reinstalling does nothing. You can't have any overlays on which sucks major donkey bolas for those of us that play and use discord, or even our cards overlay like Nvidia's.   It's SUPER unoptimized. maximum and medium settings run the same for my rig which runs most modern AAA titles on ultra or very high. CGI cutscenes are choppy. gameplay is sometimes choppy depending on how it feels and it all adds up to an experience that would make you a pendehoe playing it in it's current state.   I've tried getting a refund due to the dismal experience but they claim i can't because of the hours I have logged... Yes... Hours I have logged leaving the game open when I slept so I could still play without having to get a degree in computer engineering to get it to run.  If this still hasn't dissuaded you from purchasing this game, then wait until the game launch bugs are fixed or you're going to uninstall it out of frustration like I have.

126662256,english,0,1811260,"I've bought every single FIFA since 2016 and this is by far the worst. The amount of problems it has on PC is insane. Here's a list of some I encountered:  - Game doesn't start when I press play on Steam (I had to close Origin via Task Manager and try a few times)  - Once that works, it says that anticheat is already installed and crashes the moment the game opens (fixed by manually uninstalling their anticheat and reinstalling it, but it doesn't always work)  - Very high GPU usage and temperatures in the menus, much higher than when I'm actually in game. I have a good PC and no game has ever used this many resources. It runs at 144fps, but the temperatures and % usage is unacceptable.  - Limiting the game to 60fps via the graphics menu does not work since it's a Vsync setting (full or half frames) based on your monitor refresh rate. This is something that hasn't been fixed for a few years now.  Both this and gpu usage were fixed by changing graphics to low and limiting fps to 60 via Nvidia control panel.  Keep in mind that even if you manage to make the game work, it's not guaranteed to keep working in the future. The gameplay is also a considerable downgrade from last year, but some people like it so I suppose that's subjective. Overall, it's clear that they don't care about PC. The price is the same as console version though, so I expect the same quality.   I'll change my review if things improve, but that is very unlikely.  EDIT: As of 8 December (and a game update later), I am still encountering the same issues. Do not buy it regardless of price."

123436965,english,0,1811260,"I've always kinda defended FIFA. With the standard phrases like ''It's fun because it's a football game'', or ''You don't understand because you're not a football fan yourself''. But this is different. Way different.  FIFA 23 doesn't even work... It's now a week after release and some folks still aren't able to even launch the game, I have to start Origin in Administrator Mode for it to work, but at least I can play. That being said, servers are trash. They always were, but it's even worse this time. Navigating through the menu's feels buggy and rough around the edges, the game is poorly optimized, and they even haven't fixed some issues that were in FIFA 22, which is astonishing to me.  But now for the most important part, the gameplay. This is where FIFA 23 has it's occasional shine. PC-Players finally got Next-Gen after being completely ignored with FIFA 22 last year. While playing the game, you can feel the game isn't as arcade-like anymore. It's much more slow-paced, and you have to actually think about your next move or pass on the pitch. On the other hand, the AI is mind-blowingly dumb... Players are standing still when the ball rolls past them 15 centimetres away from their feet. Or suddenly your attacker cancels his run past the last defender, which is incredibly frustrating. And maybe the most ridiculous and game-breaking one, if you play against the AI, for example in Career Mode or Squad Battles, the opponent's goalkeeper can't even receive a pass... Like seriously, they are scoring own-goals like it's nothing.  Some new features like the Power Shots are fun and make for some absolute bangers, but the game overall is underwhelming. This combined with the fact that some people that paid 70 or 80 bucks (!!!) can't even start up the game, gave me the feeling I should write a review for this 5/10 game. For now, stay far away from it.  Congratulations EA, you've made the last FIFA, the worst FIFA."

From the endlessly frustrating gameplay to the buggy and glitchy graphics, it's clear that the developers put a lot of time and effort into making sure this game was as terrible as possible.  But let's talk about the real star of the show: the AI. Wow, what a thrill it is to be completely outclassed by the computer at every turn. It's almost as if the game was designed specifically to make the player feel completely helpless and incompetent. And let's not forget about the matchmaking system, which always manages to pair me up with players who are significantly more skilled than I am. It's like a never-ending cycle of misery and disappointment.  But the worst part has to be the microtransactions. I mean, who doesn't love spending their hard-earned money on virtual players that are completely and utterly useless? It's a great feeling to know that I can spend real money on a game that is already so overpriced, just to have a slightly better chance at winning.  Overall, I can't recommend FIFA 23 enough. If you're looking for a game that will drain all of your motivation and self-esteem, this is the one for you."

The game wont feel like it's worth the full amount as it is a Fifa 22 re-skin. However, it still is a solid pick up for the offer and you wont feel let down. After so long the game looks better on PC and the gameplay is solid too. Defending feels way less sloppy and keepers are more closer to their human counterparts. Attacking can be done cleverly and defenders no longer catch up to you as pace ratings play a more important role atleast from what i have experienced. That said, the game isnt completely bug free with occasional glitches popping up even in my short span of play but it isnt cyberpunk level broken. I obviously do not support the way EA milks the FIFA series but this game definitely deserves a slightly better rating. As for anyone experiencing frame drops, turning off dynamic resolution helped fix that issue for me."

123078531,english,0,1811260,"STEAM DECK USERS can't play FIFA 23 on the deck because of the EA kernel-level anti-cheat software that detects Proton / SteamOS as ""hacks"", sort of. The only way to have it working is installing Windows 10 on the deck, which is bad news cause the overall performance gets worsened on the deck with Windows.   And why does it even have a kernel-level anti-cheat, if the FUT transfer market isn't shared with us PC players? If you're on console, the market is shared between ALL the consoles: ps4, ps5, X1, XsX & XsS. But we PC players are excluded & can only trade between us.  A kernel-level anti-cheat has way higher privileges then it should & having it installed is like having a hole in your PC's security that can be exploited by viruses. Now have in mind EA will be on charge... what could go wrong? [url=https://youtu.be/PY41wMvwrLQ?t=221] Here's a video explaining this & its consequences in depth. [/url]   Putting that aside: This game lays off a foundation on which they should build upon in the following game. It's a step in the right direction compared with the last title, since at least now we got Hypermotion2 & crossplat for the first time in PC, but sadly there are aspects to improve (+ tons of bugs).   [list] [*]You can't play Volta online with your friends like you play online friendlies, leaving a massive mode (volta) to be played only against bots. Horrible decision.  [*]If you enable ""listen to music while on gameplay"" [spoiler](which allows you to listen to FIFA songs INSTEAD of the commentators)[/spoiler] you WON'T be able to skip songs while you're playing a match & you'll have to wait until the match is finished in order to skip the song. Also, no songs in online modes. For some reason is just plain silence for me.  [*] EA has DISABLED [url=https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay?snr=1_7_7_230#together]""Remote Play Together""[/url], so you won't be able to invite your friends & play remotely, instead each one of you will have to pay $60. (Note that game publishers in Steam have the ability to enable or disable this). [*]The mouse cursor hides itself at the center of the screen but in some instances it's still functional, meaning that if you're trying to select an option located on the edges, it won't let you & you'll think your controller is unresponsive, but is just the invisible mouse in the middle. So you'll have to move it away in order to be able to select the other options. You can reproduce this issue going into FUT > Moments.  [*]If you have 2 controllers & want to play split-screen, both players should use the same button layout. None of you can use different control settings because if one is different, it will overwrite the other player controller settings.  [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/qjt7sk/xbox_series_x_fifa_22_second_controller_settings/]This happens to some users since FIFA 21 across all platforms,[/url] yet it has never been addressed by EA, which tells us they only care about FUT.  [*]After scoring a goal, the ball keeps rolling even if the player takes it with their hands as a celebration.  [*]The ""classic"" button scheme has been remapped, which doesn't affect me but I'm just mentioning it for those who care: [b]LB+RB[/b] has been changed to ""power shot"". To execute a ""Low Driven shot"" you should gently press [b]B[/b] and release it asap. [b]LT+B[/b] does an outside foot shot if you're running.

So you should go try it. If 10hs aren't enough, you can buy EA Play Pro ($15 a month) & you'll get to play the whole game for 30 days, all the hours you want. Personally I would recommend waiting till the game hits $30, only then I'd buy it."

131521491,english,0,1811260,"I have hundreds of hours on older titles mostly on the Ultimate team mode and i could easily say do not buy this game. It's beyond broken on PC and i will point out everything bad me or my friends saw after 130+ hours on it.   I will start with the few positives about it so i can give credit where i can. - Career mode is fun and well done and most likely the only mode where you will enjoy the game.  - Pro clubs is okay and Online Seasons too.   - Fun to play with friends (when it works).    And here are the negatives.  - First and the most important it's a gamble if the game would even start because the anti-cheat is so broken and after every patch there is some kind of problem that you need to fix for it to run and it's just a joke EA doesn't bother doing something about it after so many months.  - The PC version of the game is not optimized at all compared to the next gen on console's it uses a lot of CPU for no reason. Even if you are in the menu browsing and doing something you could still feel the slight delay especially compared to older FIFA's. - Graphics on PC aren't good even on maximum settings.  - Connection is again awful in most of the game modes especially in FUT which is unacceptable for a company that makes so much money every year and doesn't buy any proper good servers. - This is something that happens to a friend of mine and i've heard it happens to a lot of people as well, when you open packs in FUT if there is a high rated walkout player the game crashes (He is with an Amd graphics card it seems there is no problem with the Nvidia ones)  - If you make a custom settings for your controller the game resets it all the time for no reason so you have to pause during the match and do them again which gets super annoying.  - Compared to older Fifa's they made huge FUT events like Team of the year for example which is running right now awful for the players making SBC's drain your coin balance and make you give more players than you get in return which just forces you to buy more and more Fifa points to keep up.  -  A big reason for me to buy this game was the new Cross-play they promoted so much and the Cross-Market in FUT but guess what? You can only play FUT friendlies with a person who has a console, You can't play seasons , Pro club , Co-op or anything fun. FUT market is also not cross platform for PC for absolutely no reason (only PlayStation and Xbox share market now) - And now the most annoying thing in the game in my opinion is the Scripted gameplay in Ultimate team mode and what i mean by this is the game makes you lose. It doesn't matter how good of a player you are the game will make you lose against worse players than you. You will hit the Goalpost nonstop the ball will randomly drop in the enemy player's foot , after tackles the ball will stay in him, you can have expected goals 5 and your opponent can have 0.9 but still he will win 3-2 against you and this usually happens in matches you really need to win for FUT champions or draft.   Seriously don't buy this game and don't give EA money if you really really want to play it just buy it on a next gen console on a big sale or have someone gift it to you other than that you will hate yourself for wasting your money for buying another EA game which is completely broken."

Ok then, - after some googleing I came accross some solutions that mentioned issues with the anti-cheat, so followed all those, but none worked. Ok sure, I'll turn on Secure boot then purely for Fifa as I generally think the games are worth it.

However, it felt like I was playing the same game as last year, with very little added innovation or changes.  The graphics and animations were also underwhelming. In an age where other games are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of graphics, FIFA 23 felt outdated and unimpressive. Additionally, I experienced several audio glitches and poor sound quality, which made the overall experience quite frustrating.  To make matters worse, the game had numerous bugs and glitches that affected gameplay. These issues were so severe that I lost progress and, in some cases, lost matches. It was quite frustrating and took away from the enjoyment of the game.  Finally, I have to say that the pay-to-win elements were really disappointing. It felt like the game was designed to force players to spend money to progress and improve, which really took away from the sense of accomplishment that comes with mastering a game through hard work and dedication.  Overall, I have to say that FIFA 23 fell short of my expectations. It lacked innovation, had outdated graphics and animations, and was plagued by bugs and glitches.

I have played 126h all of which using a VM with GPU passthrough. Why? Because I will not allow such malware to run on a Windows installation where I keep my own data. And neither should anyone, really, considering the risks this software poses if hacked.  So either allow turning off the anticheat to play in offline mode! Or, JUST REFUND THE RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE GAME as this is essentially a breach of contract.  EDIT: my hours went up because I found a workaround. If a guy like me can find a workaround why even having the AC running in the first place?"

Easy fix, only have one main controller in.   I haven't played since Fifa 17 on the good 'ol Xbox 360 and recently bought Fifa 22 which I was blown away with. Fifa 23 being 45% off I bought it and well, I'm generally impressed. The PC graphics from 22 to 23 have improved tenfold, new animations and the gameplay generally is more realistic in my opinion. I feel as though I'm rewarded for scoring against AI.  THE AI:  Bloody AI is so unpredictable you have a League 2 team starting to be prime barca with the passing. Easy fix, sliders. Other than the occasional ""wtf"" goal, it's not too bad out of the box.   70/100 recommend to a career player.  I've been lucky and haven't experienced any glitches which makes me upset. To each their own. Enjoy the game lads!"

125456831,english,0,1811260,"Some improvement over the last edition I played (2021), but the biggest edge hasn't been smoothed. Probably my last EA soccer game.  [b]Frostbitten[/b] The game's biggest strength has also been it's biggest weakness for years. The Frostbite engine has put in place hundreds if not thousands of flexible animations which allow play to branch at every possible angle creating beautiful, dynamic gameplay. The cost for this is [i]the game putting ~5 yard radius force-fields around players[/i] immediately on the ball making closing down players incredibly and unnecessarily difficult. The close down option is insufficient for higher level play and using the jockey button sends you out of position if the ball handler does pretty much anything (I think the game assumes that you were faked out by whatever they did, even if they slightly changed pace in the direction that you are going).  [b]Player Career Mode[/b] Player career mode still has issues. I had my controller disconnect mid-match. When I reconnected, the game assumed that I switched teams and prevented any achievement progress. Much worse, [i]the camera stopped acknowledging my existence[/i] to instead focus only on the ball. The team I was playing for also loved swapping my position mid-play (Could be minute 80, could be minute 25). While poor form in itself, the fact that [i]nothing on screen acknowledged the change[/i] caused confusion and multiple out of position rating deductions. It is not uncommon for this to happen multiple times in a game, adding a layer of frustration and paranoia to my favorite game mode.  [b]Miscellaneous Feel Bads[/b] Launching the game feels like a chore with the long anti-cheat pre-load section which also triggers multiple system yes/no alert prompts. The UX also feels unresponsive at times with the UI sometimes waiting seconds between user action and any on-screen acknowledgement (Audio or visual). Not sure if this is because the UI is trying to process and show too much information or if there is a threading issue, but the UI is too slick looking for the game to not at least trigger a sound effect when the user performs a menu action.  [b]Bright Spots[/b] There are some bright spots. The menus continue to get prettier and more streamlined. When the force-fields are down, there is a lot of fun to be had in the close quarters dueling, especially on offense. The overall gameplay continues to feel a bit more fluid. Making money relevant in player career mode as well as having personality choices are a welcome change, even if they don't seem to have much of an effect on play.  [b]It's Time[/b] I have enjoyed the game for decades, but fighting against both the other team and the engine to play good defense continues to be a very frustrating experience. It's been an issue for years, and it's not changing in any meaningful way. Couple that with the menu and career issues and playing the game becomes tiring. I'm exhausted. I'm done. It was a good run, but goodbye FIFA/EA Sports FC. I think it's time that I move on."

Literally no one likes it and the fact that games restart multiple times when switching between them renders the concept of all games being on the same launcher screen useless.  All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games.  Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place.  Warzone exists because of Fortnite.  Really we should be blaming EPIC Games for the COD launcher; maybe the heads of Activision believe enough microtransaction slop and confusing menu screens will make their game as profitable as Fortnite.  We'll see."
192539147,english,0,1938090,"Call of Duty — A Masterclass in Disappointment Ah, Call of Duty. The game franchise that somehow manages to release the same game every single year, slap a different name on it, and still charge full price like it’s the second coming of gaming innovation.  Gameplay? Copy + Paste. Every year it's:  Sprint → Slide → Jump → Die to some 12-year-old halfway across the world bunny-hopping with an MP5.  Respawn → Get killed by a camper in the corner → Rage.  That’s the real Call of Duty cycle. Forget skill — this game rewards whoever can mount their gun on a window ledge faster than you can say ""broken hitboxes.""  Maps? Recycled Garbage. Remember that one map you liked from 10 years ago? Surprise, it's back! Only now it’s somehow worse. Either it's littered with a million objects that block movement or wide open fields where snipers thrive like mosquitoes in summer.  Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) — aka SweatFest 3000 Trying to have fun? Not in this economy. The game sees you do well for ONE match and suddenly throws you into lobbies with professional esports wannabes rocking headsets more expensive than your console.  Microtransactions — The Real MVP Want a cool skin? $20. Want that same skin but in a slightly different color? Another $20. Want to actually feel like content isn’t locked behind a paywall? Too bad.  It’s like they sat in a meeting and said, ""How can we charge players for basic fun?""  Warzone? More like Bugzone. Cheaters, invisible skins, broken guns, game crashes — it’s like a free-to-play FPS mixed with a beta test nobody asked for. Every patch fixes 1 bug and adds 3 new ones.  Final Verdict: Call of Duty isn’t a game anymore — it’s a $70 annual subscription to rage, sweat, and disappointment. But somehow... we all keep playing it. And that’s probably the biggest scam of all."

Do not waste your money on this game and especially avoid the battlepass/premium shit like I did. Its predatory and all the premium content is just overpriced designs for operators I have no connection too while baiting another 100 mile battlepass grind that is just lackluster in sht content. Progression is insanely slow and there is a premium version of the premium battlepass. Yes you read that correctly. You get all the contexts of the premium battlepass that you  JUST bought but an extra $20 and you will get the same contents but will have another color with particle affects of the same skin/design.  BIG BIG BIG issue for me personally is too many ****ing menus, tabs, buttons to press things on the screen. You open the ****ing game and god forbid you press anything cause every button somehow opens a menu.. Who actually designed this UI???. Its like looking at a gas station bathroom wall of ADVERTISEMENTS of the very game you are playing at that moment. The UI is just absolutely horrendous whoever designed this UI just completely needs to be fired and never rehired for anything pertaining to ****ing UI.

In order to play the BO6 open beta I had to do the following: - Download the BO6 open beta, which also downloaded MW2 mp, which I own; - Open the Call of Duty launcher; - Restart the launcher because of an update, after which it started crashing; - After a few tries, I managed to start the launcher once again, after which it required another restart; - Finally I managed to arrive in the interface where I could select Black Ops 6 Open Beta, which I did; - The Call of Duty launcher closed and BO6 started loading; - After BO6 loaded, it required another restart because of an update; - After the restart, I got an error regarding the loading of player stats, which forced me to quit to desktop.  How the hell is this possible?  Even if I somehow manage to play this godforsaken demo, why would I buy this abomination if I have to go through such a hassle in order to play it?  I will probably uninstall MW2, perhaps this will help, because otherwise I have to go through almost the same process once again.  Edit: So I managed to play it and other that the occasional typical sweaty hyperactive players, it is quite enjoyable. However, I would still not recommend it. After every update it still requires you to restart the game after opening the CoD launcher and selecting BO6 which closes the CoD launcher and opens BO6. It's stupid that they did not change this since MW1 reboot. At least make it check for the update and restart it faster, perhaps upon opening the launcher, not after 1 minute wasted in the loading screens."

Oh wait, I can’t — because 80% of the time, you’re dealing with tryhards, cheaters and or babies. Some guys must have IV drips of energy drinks, because they play like their lives depend on it. One moment you’re respawning, the next you’re a target dummy for some sweat-soaked, basement-dwelling pro who’s clearly forgotten what sunlight looks like. The matchmaking is a tragedy for new players.  And don't get me started on the servers. Imagine trying to play a game while surfing the internet on a potato. Yup, that’s pretty much the experience. Lag spikes that could launch you to the moon, disconnects that make you question your Wi-Fi provider, and enough glitches to make you think you’re in a Matrix sequel.

177481296,english,1,1938090,"This game is intended solely for the most resolute individuals, those who perhaps grapple with certain inner afflictions. It is teeming with various groups of challengers: there are the relentless ""sweats,"" forever straining to outdo one another; the so-called ""movement demons,"" whose every action seems designed to bewilder and outmaneuver; and, of course, the perennial campers, who seem to find joy in hiding within a building for the entire match, only to claim victory with a paltry two team eliminations (a strategy which, I must confess, I utterly despise).  However, beyond these troublesome opponents, one of the most lamentable and regressive issues within the game is the overly harsh toxicity filter, with penalties that are grossly disproportionate to the offense. What we seek is a space where we may express our frustrations freely—where we can curse our enemies with full force, so as to avoid destroying our own equipment in sheer frustration. Yet, Activision has decided to sanitize the community to such a degree that genuine in-game communication has nearly vanished, save for the occasional child whose voice emerges amidst the clamor of their parents' quarrels in the background.  Moreover, Activision, I feel assured that I speak on behalf of the entire original community—the veteran players who have consistently spent their hard-earned money on a game that, in truth, changes but little with each passing year, overseen by certain spoiled and aging executives (whose indulgent misdeeds have been laid bare through well-known leaks). We categorically reject the imposition of a voice chat filter that, after a single warning, silences players—barring communication for weeks, months, or even indefinitely. We do not pay for a service merely to have our freedoms so unjustly curtailed.  I did not intend to offend the team or any individual, but my patience is wearing thin. As I hold out hope that you are making a positive shift with BO6 and sincerely listening to the community, I ask that you take this request to heart.  Thank you, Your dear Traziverse"

I admit the gunplay is excellent and engaging, but after investing over 200 hours each in MWII (2022) and MWIII (2023), the gameplay hasn't justified the time and money spent. There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.

178424550,english,0,1938090,"[h3]Black Ops 6 Review[/h3] I'd prefer to give this a neutral review if that was possible but for the price point, the negatives here slightly outweigh the positives. I haven't put a significant number of hours into any Call of Duty since Ghosts and haven't played the past few releases at all. Initially I found myself having a lot of fun with this release, but after 30+ hours into multiplayer, that amount of fun is quickly diminishing. But, let's start with the good first: [h3]The Good[/h3] [list]    [*] Bo6 doesn't disappoint with zombies. It has a great pace and being able to exfil or save & quit and come back later is a great feature.     [*] The campaign is definitely a different pace compared to previous titles, focused more on stealth but I've been enjoying it thus far. Veteran difficulty does feel a bit too easy though.    [*] The omnimovement added to multiplayer definitely leads to a higher skill ceiling, but the 360 degree turning feels really good. SBMM playing solo seems to work fairly well, I don't necessarily feel like the opposite team is at a way higher skill level than I am. [/list] [h3]The Bad[/h3] I've always preferred playing multiplayer and unfortunately there a number of issues that have been taking the fun out of it for me. [list]    [*] After enough crashing and errors, the game finally got me to boot it into safe mode and the settings changes since then have greatly improved performance. Unfortunately, that means I'm now playing with very low/low graphics options which says something about how this game is optimized (I have no issues running ultra on other games).    [*] I find the majority of the maps are just outright not enjoyable. There are several great maps (Stakeout, Pit, Warhead, Nuketown, Skyline), some are ok, but the rest I actively try to avoid. Hoping there are new maps that get added that can increase the amount of 'good' maps that are in the game.    [*] Recon is an absolutely broken speciality. Honestly, I don't think specialities are even needed and I'd be in favour of just outright removing them. At the very least, Recon needs to be changed as its buffs are way too strong on the small map size we have across the board.    [*] Snipers and Marksman Rifles feel very inconsistent with what constitutes a hit marker and what constitutes a kill. AR's also seem a bit on the weaker side and the latest nerfs to them don't help at all. Feels like SMGs are almost a must play right now with how strong they are.    [*] Walls are paper thin. You can shoot through literally anything without FMJ and grenades will also explode directly through some walls.     [*] The spawn system is absolutely atrocious. I have watched kill cams of an opposing player aimed down sight directly at me and watching me spawn in. This needs significant work.    [*] SBMM if playing with a group of friends seems unbalanced. Compared to playing solo, the opposing team always seems to do WAY better than us regardless of how many games we play. [/list]  Overall, I have ups and downs with this game. Unfortunately, the fun has started to fade away, but I think that could be turned around if a few key changes are made to the game."

The more you play, the more it becomes clear: time, with all its weight and inevitability, has slipped away, leaving behind only the ghosts of younger days. You’re trapped in a cycle, replaying the same battles, but knowing that no matter how many times you respawn, you can never return to that feeling.

No need to spend 1000+ hours to gear up, you can kick some a$$ right from lvl 1 provided you got some skills.   BO6 is fast-paced and the omnimovement is a great addition, as a player who enjoys rushing -and clearly better at moving than aiming- I really appreciate.   Of course there are a few things that would need to be reviewed : aimassist is a bit too strong. I don't mind fighting controllers (I only get that in my lobbies anyway...), but clearly the tracking is too op, that's really striking on killcams. Even top pro players like FormaL are complaining about it. He made a video where you can see Scump and others on old CoD vs new ones (they were already pros at their best) and the aim had really nothing to do, plenty of bullets missed...At worst, add some ""device filtering"", I'm sure a lot would appreciate.   Cheaters :  Dev and the editor really need to do something here. Most of my games are ok, but there are way too many people who seemed ""really good"". Of course in 20y the skilled population on the game has clearly increased, and some kiddos w/ controllers are really good, but still...there are manyyyy YT videos in which you can see players bragging about their cheating devices or soft, some of them paying up to 30 bucks per month to play w/ them (I mean wtf !!..). Vanguard on Valorant seems to be the most effective. Who cares (apart from cheaters) if it's intrusive on your device if it's to guarantee the game will be safe...  EBMM :  Regarding EBMM, the main prob i see is that your weapons damages are quite inconsistent. In previous games up to BO4, every time I stopped firing I knew I'd get the kill. Here, this is quite random : sometimes i have a good run on multi games and suddenly my damage feels like it dropped to 50% of their initial value...I stop firing thinking the ennemy's down but no, the guys is alive and only needs a couple of bullets to kill me. This can be quite frustrating and if you're used to the game w/ a good level you can clearly 'feel' this taking place over games.   Other than that, the overall experience is good, the gameplay is incredible and there's absolutely no FPS (played them all) who can compete on this gameplay quality. The devs have done an amazing job on this and since the last MW2 this is getting better and better (on the gameplay, as previously mentioned, some things need to be tuned down)."

186305043,english,1,1938090,"BO6 is a decent game but theres so many things that need to change or tone down at least.  SBMM combined with EOMM is a joke, AA is a joke.  As a keyboard and mouse player, the only really fair way to play and level the playing field from this game is playing hardcore, as the Aim assist on this game is a joke! I'm not someone who says aim assist shouldn't exist etc however I feel they need to tone it down as playing ranked or core it takes the most basic, average and worst players 0 skill what so ever and they simply lock on to you with a computer reaction time of 0ms and tracking accuracy of a god and kill anyone in there path.  The amount of stupid operator skins is crazy. Getting killed by unicorns....on call of duty. I have had 4000cp from previous COD's and I have not to spent anything on this game, because everything in the store is a joke. All AI art work. The operators are all PAY TO LOSE. Nothing even looks cool anymore, most call of duty's previously only brought out the desperate money grabbing operator skins near the end of the life of that call of duty cycle after they ran out of ideas for the game. Yet BO6 did it the second the store was available.   This game is a 18+ rated game. It acts like a 3+ The operators use curse words and say ""offensive"" things. Yet you say something in game chat voice chat etc you are comms banned instantly. This is because there are too many smooth brained snowflakes out there especially how everyone forget that you CAN mute people or turn off voice chat if you can't handle a bit of toxic gamer banter.   The banning system on this game is broken. People know that if you report someone they are most likely going to get banned. So by playing good everyone reports you, it is now the normal for reporting someone for nothing and the second someone says a single swear word such as SH** for accidentally shooting a teammate in HC or a suicide. Someone WILL report you because that's how call of duty have allowed this soft reporting system. The shadow ban system is a JOKE I got shadow banned for smoking people on search and destroy going 26-4 etc and the whole team reports me now i get put into a pool of other shadow banned people. Its essentially ""remand before prison"" Now once in a shadow banned lobby there is hackers / cronus users EVERYWHERE. They need to fix all this sh**  They also need to sort the acheivement process out. Why have MW3 acheivements mixed with BO6, wow so smart. Now anyone on steam cannot get a 100% for trying to complete everything."

The core gameplay is a fucking blast and that's why I'm so torn on being able to recommend or enjoy the game as it is. Artists prior to this game's release were fired, the ones that were allowed to stay are forced to use generative AI in their workflow and now we're seeing the direct consequences of it. Low quality, barely coherent and generally uninspired and incorrect are some of the words I'd use. Now due to the lack of protections the actors are facing namely regarding voice replication, most of if not all of the current dedicated zombies cast are being recast as they have either joined the SAG-AFTRA strike or simply refuse to bend the knee.

184927241,english,0,1938090,"Why I decided to stop spending money and look for a different game. My dissatisfaction with this game stems from several factors that directly affect the enjoyment and comfort of playing. After spending over 800 hours in the game, I’ve had plenty of great moments, but lately, frustration has taken over enjoyment. Here are the key reasons for my decision:  Lack of transparency regarding player data. It’s crucial to be able to see other players’ statistics, such as level, K/D ratio, and total playtime. These stats help determine whether you’re facing a cheater or simply a skilled opponent. Unfortunately, no such tools exist, making the game feel opaque and untrustworthy.  Cheater problem. Cheaters have always been a major issue in many online games. Constantly doubting whether your opponent is playing fair ruins the experience. Moreover, devices like Cronus, which give console players an unfair advantage, only worsen the situation.  Imbalance between controller and mouse. As a mouse player, I constantly feel disadvantaged against controllers with strong Aim Assist. Even with equal skills, I have no chance of outgunning a player with decent Aim Assist. This imbalance becomes more noticeable with every match.  Technical issues. Frequent crashes, bugs, and errors have become the norm. During a 4-hour session, the game might crash 5-6 times, often forcing us to restart matchmaking because someone in the lobby experiences a crash.  Events and skins. What used to be exciting events and high-quality skins now feel like low-effort content designed to grab more money. Events lack creativity, and the skins no longer have the same vibe or appeal they once did.  The upcoming event will be the game’s last chance for me. It will also be my final in-game purchase. While I don’t expect much to change, I still have a sliver of hope. After spending 800 hours in the game, I’ve genuinely enjoyed it, but I feel like I joined the community too late. Games are meant to be enjoyed, not endured."

185693443,english,0,1938090,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022) is the sequel to the re-imagined Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019).  The game features some frenetic firefights, lavish visuals and more spy-on-spy action than you can shake a stick at.  Despite all these qualities, it is perhaps one of the most disappointing Call of Duty entries in years and serves as a testament to how Infinity Ward has lost their way and need to regroup.  The game fails at almost every single game play objective it set out to achieve and, consequently, misses an opportunity to catapult itself to the upper echelon of contemporary, AAA first person shooters.  Starting with the positives, CoD: MW II has truly beautiful, atmospheric and performant next generation graphics.  Volumetric lightning, HDR, character models and map architecture are all top notch and it is a joy to finally see CoD take its place as a graphics powerhouse befitting from such a venerable, AAA studio.  The game's voice acting and soundtrack are excellent and global sound effects like ancillary sounds/bullet travel help create a believable environment.  Gun play is sublime, with punchy, differentiated weapons and a variety of applicable add-ons.  CoD includes a battery of game play modes including singleplayer, multiplayer, co-op and more.  The game is truly performant and netted a respectable, upscaled 95 fps @ 4K high on a 6 year old Radeon VII.  Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.  The title suffers from staid, repetitive missions, frustratingly over-long set pieces, absurd game play events and perhaps one of the most foolhardy plot lines I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing.  While you get the usual fare in this game, including A-120 strikes, Republique-style ally guided missions and the plethora of sniper missions/night vision assaults, the game has been assembled, lacking even the most basic game play testing.  Enemies will spawn behind you, walk through walls or camp behind objects, only to shoot you as you cross into their field of view.  At moderate-high difficulty levels, this type of AI programming and map design prove extremely frustrating and unfair, requiring multiple play-throughs to complete.  The AI vacillates between bouts of telepathy, x-ray vision and abject stupidity, often being able to see you in an adjacent room, through three walls and other times missing a pile of dead cohorts just a few feet away.  It is this terrible mission design and piss-poor AI that punishes CoD: MW II so much, since the game is based on numerous stealth/avoidance missions.  What should be a tense game of cat and mouse quickly ends up becoming a litany of AI exploits instead to simply progress to the next malformed set piece.  At one point, while trying to stealthily infiltrate the Mexican drug lord Sin Nombre's mansion, I acquired the attention of several guards.  I happened to be in a bathroom, with no windows, on the second floor at the time. The guards were all on the first floor, outside of the structure, not that it mattered.  The game quick saved the occurrence and I soon found myself dying over and over and unable to reset the stealth parameters of the mission.  How did I bypass the issue? I camped the bathroom, and shot henchmen as they teleported into the bathroom and walked through the door.  After slaying about 20 goons, I had created an almost impossible to traverse, 4-foot pile of bodies clogging the bathroom door, which protected me from the incoming hail of gunfire and grenades.  I completed my duties and calmly proceeded with the mission.  Easy? Sure.  Satisfying? Hardly.  Unfortunately this happens over and over and over in CoD: MW II.  Stealth is terribly realized and almost always it's easier to cheese the AI than actually play the game as intended.  For example, during the final mission against Hassan, the final boss, you are disarmed and forced to play cat-and-mouse with two of his annoyingly cheesy, armored goons.  They have automatic weapons and you're forced to dash around, hoovering all the ingredients you can find so you can craft rudimentary tools and weapons.  Unfortunately, the AI glitched and the enemies soon kept running behind me, impossible to shake.  No amount of ducking behind corners, memorized quick-play bomb defusing key presses or flat out sprinting kept them away from me, as they would simply pop into existence and teleport right next to me, firing away.  I beat them both by hiding behind a door as they impotently punched it trying to incapacitate  me.  I calmly defused the bomb and then sprinted past them when I was done, to find the missing materials I needed to craft the necessary tools and weapons.  This happens *all the time*.  It felt like a dullard type of an FPS Elden Ring.    The plot fares no better with a primitive, uninteresting tale about multinational super spy, wokejob strike teams, stolen stinger missiles and a mismatched, Frankensteined quilt of enemies including Iran, Mexican drug cartels, Shadow Company and the US military.  Oh and of course the Russians are in there too.   You play as Gaz or Soap but skip any lengthy bouts as the infinitely cooler elder statesmen Price and Ghost.  You kill most targets as your AI stands behind impotently as you proceed from one inane mission to the next, often undoing the very thing you accomplished minutes earlier.  This is especially egregious when you spend two different missions capturing dangerously murderous Iranian terrorists and Mexican drug lords, only to be forced to release them without any information, simply because they demand you do so in the name of legality and justice.  Multiplayer is no better with an abusive, rotten environment, predicated on feeding whales an ever-larger stash of multiplayer trash that they can use to show off as they play in multiplayer matches.  Want to jump in and experience intelligent matchmaking that will pit you against similarly-skilled enemies? That is a pipe dream.  In over 3/4 of my 20 online matches I routinely faced teams of 1250+ level players against my rag-tag squad of single-digit noobs, wannabes and mid-level players.  Do you want to play a game where you can craft a build, choose the weapon of your choice and have fun?  Forget about having that kind of freedom in Cod: MW II.  You start using demonstrably weaker weapons and unlock newer, stronger, more accurate, farther-striking weapons after sickening amounts of MMO-like grind.  Mods, perks, and even the dearth of decent cosmetic items are all locked behind Great Wall of China-sized walls of insurmountable grind.  Heaven help you if you jump into this game a few years after release.  To level and unlock new loot, you need to accrue experience, and win matches but it's precisely the lack of necessary tools that will hamper your ability to do so.  Players all ramble on in group chat, to the detriment of tense, interesting games. You find yourself muting everyone, so you can hear important auditory cues and excise what little bit of social interaction this game has available.  Most players are toxic and those few that aren't, don't stick around long enough to help make the game more bearable.  CoD: MW II is badly assembled, causing me to crash half a dozen times.  While some were simple fixes that required a quick execution of Task Manager, two particular crashes lead to black screens that required a system restart.  Worse, the restarts damaged the graphics driver and I was forced to enact a MS System Restore (thankfully) to salvage the system.  With better and more mature/coherent plotting, more forgiving and rewarding multiplayer and better attention to the campaign game play, CoD: MW II had the chance to secure a score of a 9 or 10 and exist as a sterling example of FPS gaming.  Instead, much like its hollow ending, the title is just a bitter reminder of the lazy, disinterested job carried out by Infinity Ward.  Not worth the time.  There are better games available.  6.5/10."

Ever feel like one day you're on a roll, but the next day you can't win a single game? There's a reason for that.  Here's one quote from Activision's EOMM patent they renewed in 2019 ([url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US10857468B2]source[/url]):  [quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2]      ...responsive to a determination that the first player purchased the in-game item, the player profile may be updated to reflect the purchase and [b]the first player may be matched to play a second gameplay session[/b] in which the in-game item is suitable to be used.      For example, if the in-game item is a weapon (e.g., an accurate and powerful sniper rifle), the second gameplay session may be selected because the weapon is highly effective in the second gameplay session. Doing so [b]may encourage the first player to make subsequent purchases[/b] due to the satisfaction of effectively using the in-game item during the second gameplay session. [/quote]  TL;DR: Microtransactions directly influence matchmaking, rather than skill.   Not enough? Here's Activison's argument for why EOMM was necessary over SBMM:  [quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2]  Conventional systems further fail to leverage matchmaking processes in other contexts, [b]such as influencing game-related purchases[/b], suggesting group formations, training/identifying non-player characters, and/or otherwise extending the use of the matchmaking process. These and other drawbacks exist with current matchmaking processes utilized in multiplayer video games. [/quote]  This game is manipulating you. It doesn't care about how good you are. It doesn't care how much fun you have. It cares about your money, and Activision is willing to ruin your lobbies to get it.   The only way to win this game is to not play at all.

144525086,english,0,1938090,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.   The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.   You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

Why do developers just keep adding more things to these games? Just make a game that focuses on FPS. I'm over all the cartoon characters running around making me explode into confetti when I die. Lets go back to the days of unamed soldiers, on a map that has actually been designed well, and just play PvP.

132572501,english,0,1938090,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this."

125240902,english,0,1938090,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:     There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.   These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.   I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  Fuck you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too."

[hr][/hr]  [h1] Long Version [/h1]  [h3] Multiplayer [/h3]  Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.  [hr][/hr]  [h3] DMZ [/h3]  They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.  [hr][/hr]  [h3] Warzone [/h3]  Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.   You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.  [b] IW Realism Logic [/b] [list]     [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots     [*]Melee > Bullets     [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage     [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes     [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars     [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time [/list]  Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  [h1] Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it: [/h1]  [list] [*][b]What is it exactly that you do in the game?[/b]  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.  [*][b] Will it make my eyes bleed?[/b]  For $70 a game released in 2022… it’s not that graphically impressive… Sure the whole appeal of CoD is to run as light as possible so you can get 100+ FPS in the multiplayer and have low latency. But even if you max out the game it’s not that impressive. At release I found several low textures and the game still suffers from random popping on arbitrary objects for no rhyme or reason and… I don’t know if this is an AMD GPUs problem but I never managed to get rid of the film grain on my game. I even disabled image sharpening and antialiasing and I still had this effect on my screen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6e5HSU0yfU The cut scenes are by far the best part of the game. They are beautifully animated with amazing performance and great direction. But besides that, the game looks decent and at some points even impressive but… not $70 impressive.  [*][b]Does it have a good story?[/b]  I don’t know if I would call it “good”... To be fair I wouldn't consider it “bad” either. CoDMW2’s story is the excuse that the game gives you to travel around the world and kill terrorist and narcos. That’s it.  You never learn much about the characters beyond surface level stuff and they never grow or change… and the plot is a bunch of random stuff that you’re not supposed to question. It feels like watching a youtube supercut of the “coolest” bits of a Michael Bay movie.  [*][b]Does it have a good soundtrack?[/b]  I don’t even remember if CoDMW2 has an OST and youtube only has the track for the main theme.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPrqIgVpYrk  Soo… I don’t know.  [*][b]Does it have replay value?[/b]  Only if you are an achievement hunter. CoDMW2 offers you really cool achievements for you to unlock. My favorite is the one you get by killing enemies with a riot shield.  [*][b]Does it run well?[/b]  Well, the game runs flawlessly most of the time. But this game doesn’t run as smooth as I would have liked. I already mentioned random popping. But there are random frame drops as low as 19 FPS when the game loads new assets. And I have to mention that an update broke my save file and I had to restart the campaign again.  [*][b]Is it fun?[/b]  Only if you like CoD games.  [/list]  [h1] So what is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2?[/h1]  It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.   [h1] Things that I like about this game:[/h1]  [list] [*]Amazing gun play. CoD never disappoints with their gunplay.  [*]Great controller support.  [*]Decent yet a bit outdated graphics.  [*]Amazing cut scenes.  [*]Some missions are fantastic and so much fun to play.  [*]Great voice acting.  [*]The twist near the end is quite decent.  [*]The story is just “there”, it’s not bad but I definitely don’t hate it.  [/list]   [h1] Things that I dislike about this game:[/h1]  [list]  [*]A bit buggy and glitchy  [*]The characters are kind of bland.  [*]The AI is not great.  [*]I don’t like how this game thinks “challange” is throwing lots of armored enemies at you.  [*]I don’t like how the final boss is just an extended stealth section.  [*]The only boss in the game is a bit frustrating.   [/list] [h1] Is this game worth my hard earned money?[/h1]  For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent."

One good game, and you'll get thrown in a lobby of nothing but streamers and campers and it takes at least 3 trash games to get your KD back low enough for you to actually face people on your level again. The skill based matchmaking is garbage that no one asked for that only serves to punish casual gamers by letting them be destroyed by campers and try hards for having the audacity to do well for a game.

177846664,english,0,1938090,"I'd really like to know who the people continuing to push the COD launcher are at the top of Activision, what their roles are, and how long they've been decision makers.  Literally no one likes it and the fact that games restart multiple times when switching between them renders the concept of all games being on the same launcher screen useless.  All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games.  Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place.  Warzone exists because of Fortnite.  Really we should be blaming EPIC Games for the COD launcher; maybe the heads of Activision believe enough microtransaction slop and confusing menu screens will make their game as profitable as Fortnite.  We'll see."
142306908,english,0,1938090,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!  After investing hundreds of hours playing, buying ingame credits and thoroughly enjoying this product, I have become one of the countless people innocently perma banned for ""modifying the software"". There is no way to appeal this, get unbanned or even talk with a person. Most disturbing is that now access to the single player campaign mode is also blocked!  While the game itself is a classic, I highly DO NOT recommend buying or investing ANY money in this product as a system crash, any number of unrelated 3rd party software or thier own game crashing, allow the company to unilaterally deny you access to a game you purchased. And, this potentially contaminates any linked account or store (like Steam) you use, even other platforms.  Before buying, DO YOUR RESEARCH!! Or just stick to the free version and be prepared to just chuck it. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY this product. Waste of time, waste of money, atrocious customer service bordering on theft."
143029790,english,0,1938090,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their dogshit anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed. This may be a bit of a slow process as I am moving to university soon but it is not forgotten!"
147248687,english,0,1938090,"Dopamine slot machine. They know what they need to do to fix this franchise but they refuse to do so because CoD isn't about player enjoyment anymore, it's about metrics driven player engagement - even if that means alienating their core fan-base and fracturing the community with EOMM algorithms that are wound so tight you just yo-yo between skill bands.   IW is a terrible developer, won't be buying anymore of their titles from here forward."
147737651,english,0,1938090,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.

192539147,english,0,1938090,"Call of Duty — A Masterclass in Disappointment Ah, Call of Duty. The game franchise that somehow manages to release the same game every single year, slap a different name on it, and still charge full price like it’s the second coming of gaming innovation.  Gameplay? Copy + Paste. Every year it's:  Sprint → Slide → Jump → Die to some 12-year-old halfway across the world bunny-hopping with an MP5.  Respawn → Get killed by a camper in the corner → Rage.  That’s the real Call of Duty cycle. Forget skill — this game rewards whoever can mount their gun on a window ledge faster than you can say ""broken hitboxes.""  Maps? Recycled Garbage. Remember that one map you liked from 10 years ago? Surprise, it's back! Only now it’s somehow worse. Either it's littered with a million objects that block movement or wide open fields where snipers thrive like mosquitoes in summer.  Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) — aka SweatFest 3000 Trying to have fun? Not in this economy. The game sees you do well for ONE match and suddenly throws you into lobbies with professional esports wannabes rocking headsets more expensive than your console.  Microtransactions — The Real MVP Want a cool skin? $20. Want that same skin but in a slightly different color? Another $20. Want to actually feel like content isn’t locked behind a paywall? Too bad.  It’s like they sat in a meeting and said, ""How can we charge players for basic fun?""  Warzone? More like Bugzone. Cheaters, invisible skins, broken guns, game crashes — it’s like a free-to-play FPS mixed with a beta test nobody asked for. Every patch fixes 1 bug and adds 3 new ones.  Final Verdict: Call of Duty isn’t a game anymore — it’s a $70 annual subscription to rage, sweat, and disappointment. But somehow... we all keep playing it. And that’s probably the biggest scam of all."

Not only that, but every update that's made for simply the hub alone still like 20 gig downloads.

149792487,english,0,1938090,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back."
143425476,english,0,1938090,"I would write a full review, but I'd rather not spend more time on this game than I already have.  Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace.  2) Activision is a shit company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven asshole after I've just taken a shit. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like shit. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced shit bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're fucking stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of shit, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again.  15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

Removed the game completely from my account. Don't even want to be reminded of the constant trap I keep falling into each year with this dogsht mediocre franchise.   Do not waste your money on this game and especially avoid the battlepass/premium shit like I did. Its predatory and all the premium content is just overpriced designs for operators I have no connection too while baiting another 100 mile battlepass grind that is just lackluster in sht content. Progression is insanely slow and there is a premium version of the premium battlepass. Yes you read that correctly. You get all the contexts of the premium battlepass that you  JUST bought but an extra $20 and you will get the same contents but will have another color with particle affects of the same skin/design.  BIG BIG BIG issue for me personally is too many ****ing menus, tabs, buttons to press things on the screen. You open the ****ing game and god forbid you press anything cause every button somehow opens a menu.. Who actually designed this UI???. Its like looking at a gas station bathroom wall of ADVERTISEMENTS of the very game you are playing at that moment. The UI is just absolutely horrendous whoever designed this UI just completely needs to be fired and never rehired for anything pertaining to ****ing UI. There is no actual way they thought the UI was good.   Just don't buy this game please. This company must actually believe we are all idiots or they are idiots themselves.

All hitmarkers"" and when they hit me with a lower caliber gun the same amount of fucking times it just erases my existence?   I just cannot have fun on here. Even as a team anymore. With the SBMM and EOMM, I get punished immediately if I do slightly good in a match, by being thrown in matches with people that just shit on me the entire time.  People complain that movement is slow and terrible, but it's not. If it was, then explain why sliding and shooting around corners, or jumping and shooting is the strategy. Movement is still super fast and fucking stupid just like before. Shields and knives are near impossible to counter. Their feet are covered, can't flank because they will rush and kill you. Can't throw because they will counter throw faster somehow or just rush and kill you. Thanks. All I want is to jump into matches and have fun. No, not just stomp everyone, that's not fun. I want to have fun. I want varied lobbies, showing that people aren't just bots. It doesn't help that the aim assist actually tracks for you, with no limitations on distance or if there are particle effects in the way or not. If your aim starts to move on it's own, you just aim and fire and you're gonna get the kill. I position myself better and shoot first? Doesn't matter. Enemy moves around, causing me to have to MANUALLY track them with my mouse and eyes, while controlling recoil with particle effects and camera shake. While they can just slightly tilt R stick down and fire. Flinch? Damn right that I do but when you have aim assist, the tracking pretty much counters it. There's nothing fun about it. I am only playing it for fear of missing out, and since I already bought the damn thing. The campaign was fun but that alone isn't worth what I paid. I am not ok, and this game is making shit worse. It is infuriating, by design. I can't even get good games anymore. What is the new ""good"" for me is if I am close to breaking even. Before I could maybe 1 in 10 rounds get one where I actually do good. Now it's just getting wrecked at spawn, or instant snap turned from someone who heard me moving across the map and has UAV that works through Ghost. Or, I shoot someone first, hit them twice, and they snap and melt me with their braindead controller aim assist."
174390067,english,0,1938090,"This launcher is absolutely terrible, utterly annoying, an insurmountable pain in the ass. In order to play the BO6 open beta I had to do the following: - Download the BO6 open beta, which also downloaded MW2 mp, which I own; - Open the Call of Duty launcher; - Restart the launcher because of an update, after which it started crashing; - After a few tries, I managed to start the launcher once again, after which it required another restart; - Finally I managed to arrive in the interface where I could select Black Ops 6 Open Beta, which I did; - The Call of Duty launcher closed and BO6 started loading; - After BO6 loaded, it required another restart because of an update; - After the restart, I got an error regarding the loading of player stats, which forced me to quit to desktop.  How the hell is this possible?  Even if I somehow manage to play this godforsaken demo, why would I buy this abomination if I have to go through such a hassle in order to play it?  I will probably uninstall MW2, perhaps this will help, because otherwise I have to go through almost the same process once again.  Edit: So I managed to play it and other that the occasional typical sweaty hyperactive players, it is quite enjoyable. However, I would still not recommend it. After every update it still requires you to restart the game after opening the CoD launcher and selecting BO6 which closes the CoD launcher and opens BO6. It's stupid that they did not change this since MW1 reboot. At least make it check for the update and restart it faster, perhaps upon opening the launcher, not after 1 minute wasted in the loading screens."

This game is gorgeous, the atmosphere, weapons, animations, and characters are on another level 2. The gunplay is fantastic. Everything feels very real, and the guns are fun to use 3. The campaign is a lot of fun with some great missions and overall better character development than the original MW2. 4. The multiplayer, WHEN BALANCED, is a lot of fun to play HOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with this game. 1. Breaking up lobbies to readjust for SBMM not only penalizes the player for playing well, it also doesn't give a chance for people to build rivalries or community with other players like in older CODs. 2. The aim assist on the controller is mind numbing. The fact that I switched to a controller and am overall playing better is a bad sign. 3. The main menu/UI in this game has to be the worst I have ever seen. 4. Weapon balancing is desperately needed.

149713623,english,1,1938090,"Nvm game wanna learn how to make atom bomb? First, a PhD level of training in metallurgy to determine all of the different metals and alloys needed to fabricate the parts of the bomb. PhD level training in nuclear physics to determine exactly what isotopes and how much will be needed and, of course, exactly in what shape they will be needed. A PhD level of training in explosives to determine what type and how much explosive will be needed for the various non-nuclear parts of the bomb. A Tool and Die level of expertise as a machinist to fabricate the parts correctly for the bomb. So far all of these areas of expertise are readily available. A couple of lifetimes of study will get you there. Naturally, you will also need a (very) nice machine shop to fabricate your device.  Now comes the more difficult part: getting fissile material. This type of material is usually available only from nation states. I have checked at Walmart, and they didn’t seem to stock it, so buying enough is going to be a problem. A big problem. A very big problem. In fact, an insurmountable problem. Fissile material is MUCH better protected than gold, and many times more expensive. So, even if you can overcome the various expertise requirements, you will have a very, very big problem getting the fissile material. However, that is just one of many problems I will leave to the ambitious bomb maker to solve.  Were you to decide to make your own fissile material, you would need to decide whether to use U235 or Pu239. In either case, you will need many tons of uranium metal, a purchase of which may draw the attention of various 3 letter agencies. This will be a fundamental decision since they are made in completely different ways. The U235 route will require thousands of ultra-centrifuges with a HUGE power plant to run them, while the Pu239 will require a nuclear reactor. Both will require very large laboratories for the industrial separation of the different highly radioactive isotopes. Just a couple more problems for the inveterate bomb maker to solve.  It might also be noted that were you to somehow manage to acquire said fissile material, there would be quite a number of agencies interested in how you got it, where it is, and just what you were planning to do with it. The FBI, CIA, MI5, KGB (or whatever their current name is) Mossad, and a few others come to mind. These tend to be (very) unfriendly and also very curious. Their methods of getting answers may not be pleasant, but since you will probably never be seen again after their visit, I would consider that aspect your personal problem, and, again, one for you to solve in due course.  So, there are a few challenges to making your own home made atomic bomb. However, with enough determination and money, you might succeed. I don’t recommend you try this at home, though. And don’t forget your neighbors won’t appreciate your testing it, either."

If you love roller coasters, you’re in for a ride — because this game crashes more often than a demolition derby! Seriously, I’ve seen more stability in a Jenga tower built by toddlers than in this game.  Let’s talk about the gameplay. Oh wait, I can’t — because 80% of the time, you’re dealing with tryhards, cheaters and or babies. Some guys must have IV drips of energy drinks, because they play like their lives depend on it. One moment you’re respawning, the next you’re a target dummy for some sweat-soaked, basement-dwelling pro who’s clearly forgotten what sunlight looks like. The matchmaking is a tragedy for new players.  And don't get me started on the servers. Imagine trying to play a game while surfing the internet on a potato. Yup, that’s pretty much the experience.

177481296,english,1,1938090,"This game is intended solely for the most resolute individuals, those who perhaps grapple with certain inner afflictions. It is teeming with various groups of challengers: there are the relentless ""sweats,"" forever straining to outdo one another; the so-called ""movement demons,"" whose every action seems designed to bewilder and outmaneuver; and, of course, the perennial campers, who seem to find joy in hiding within a building for the entire match, only to claim victory with a paltry two team eliminations (a strategy which, I must confess, I utterly despise).  However, beyond these troublesome opponents, one of the most lamentable and regressive issues within the game is the overly harsh toxicity filter, with penalties that are grossly disproportionate to the offense. What we seek is a space where we may express our frustrations freely—where we can curse our enemies with full force, so as to avoid destroying our own equipment in sheer frustration. Yet, Activision has decided to sanitize the community to such a degree that genuine in-game communication has nearly vanished, save for the occasional child whose voice emerges amidst the clamor of their parents' quarrels in the background.  Moreover, Activision, I feel assured that I speak on behalf of the entire original community—the veteran players who have consistently spent their hard-earned money on a game that, in truth, changes but little with each passing year, overseen by certain spoiled and aging executives (whose indulgent misdeeds have been laid bare through well-known leaks). We categorically reject the imposition of a voice chat filter that, after a single warning, silences players—barring communication for weeks, months, or even indefinitely. We do not pay for a service merely to have our freedoms so unjustly curtailed.  I did not intend to offend the team or any individual, but my patience is wearing thin. As I hold out hope that you are making a positive shift with BO6 and sincerely listening to the community, I ask that you take this request to heart.  Thank you, Your dear Traziverse"

I believe negative reviews are coming from cod haters of players who havn’t adjusted yet, but from someone who has played every call of duty since beginning this one brings in great game play, a refresh with a unique vibe, and some of the best performance and memory utilization yet especially on PC.

I admit the gunplay is excellent and engaging, but after investing over 200 hours each in MWII (2022) and MWIII (2023), the gameplay hasn't justified the time and money spent. There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.

129131029,english,0,1938090,"[h1] Not worth it. At all. [/h1]  Ever since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You're simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.  Skill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I'm playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it's the same scenario since the game got released.   Also, if there is a ""ranked"" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn't the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?  Extra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I'm getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?  For some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don't know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can't emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can't bother calling it aim assist anymore, it's Aimbot. For real it's aimbot. You'll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you're slightly next to their crosshair, you're done. They don't even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there's no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.  I get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they're using just their thumbs to aim, but I don't want to be a part of this. I don't want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he'll be able to get kills. It's simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it's not possible? Isn't the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & Battle.net combo?  Some TL:DR for you: [b]Pros:[/b] - Good Gunplay - Good Animations - Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons - Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock - AMD's FSR works pretty well  [b]Cons:[/b] - SBMM - No Crossplay opt-out choice - Inconsistent footsteps & audio - No Stopping Power as a perk - No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk - Matches feel rigged  *Edit 18/08/2024*  So after many extra hours and upon reaching max level, the more time I spent playing this, the more it reinforced what I and many others have already said before.  To sum it up, I'll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience I've had with this game this one year and a half:   Me and one of my friends are playing Prisoner Rescue for a two hour session in the night. First hour goes fine, we're both making good scores and we have a 7 game win-streak, we're seeing some new players and some old, matches play fine with no problem, nothing out of the ordinary happening.   Now the second hour we're playing, we're starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game. We're getting teammates that are acting like they're playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives, while the enemy team is either a 4 stack, a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend. It's a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over.   Our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual, hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend, enemy weapons get such a fast TTK it feels like a single-frame death, meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone. I was using G3A3 and my friend was using SCAR-H, and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a Battle-Rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range. Also packet loss (white color) and packet burst (orange color) was appearing every few seconds for both of us, but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session. And of course let's not forget, the enemies we're fighting have below 10 ping, meanwhile my friend is at 40 and I'm at 60.  The game's algorithm is literally nerfing you in real time, sacrificing your experience in order to make the opponent's better. It's trying really hard to keep you as close to 1 K/D and 1 W/L as possible, with whatever means it has available. Activision is known to take the fun out of their games the moment you show them you're above average and can actually play good.  People who defend this and act as if me or my friend are the problem, they're the same people getting gaslighted by the same algorithm they protect, because they're so garbage they end up playing on protected brackets of matchmaking in order to spend more money for skins.

Ever feel like one day you're on a roll, but the next day you can't win a single game? There's a reason for that.  Here's one quote from Activision's EOMM patent they renewed in 2019 ([url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US10857468B2]source[/url]):  [quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2]      ...responsive to a determination that the first player purchased the in-game item, the player profile may be updated to reflect the purchase and [b]the first player may be matched to play a second gameplay session[/b] in which the in-game item is suitable to be used.      For example, if the in-game item is a weapon (e.g., an accurate and powerful sniper rifle), the second gameplay session may be selected because the weapon is highly effective in the second gameplay session. Doing so [b]may encourage the first player to make subsequent purchases[/b] due to the satisfaction of effectively using the in-game item during the second gameplay session. [/quote]  TL;DR: Microtransactions directly influence matchmaking, rather than skill.   Not enough? Here's Activison's argument for why EOMM was necessary over SBMM:  [quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2]  Conventional systems further fail to leverage matchmaking processes in other contexts, [b]such as influencing game-related purchases[/b], suggesting group formations, training/identifying non-player characters, and/or otherwise extending the use of the matchmaking process. These and other drawbacks exist with current matchmaking processes utilized in multiplayer video games. [/quote]  This game is manipulating you. It doesn't care about how good you are. It doesn't care how much fun you have. It cares about your money, and Activision is willing to ruin your lobbies to get it.   The only way to win this game is to not play at all.

144525086,english,0,1938090,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.   The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.   You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

Lets go back to the days of unamed soldiers, on a map that has actually been designed well, and just play PvP.

132572501,english,0,1938090,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this."

125240902,english,0,1938090,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:     There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.   These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.   I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  Fuck you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too."

So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b] [b] Pros: [/b] [list]     [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.     [*]Weapon tuning     [*]Al Mazrah     [*]New battle pass and backpack system     [*]Proximity chat     [*]3rd person modes [/list]  [b] Cons: [/b] [list]     [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps     [*]Movement     [*]UI     [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask     [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product     [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting     [*]TTK (Time To Kill)     [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game     [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy     [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps     [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map     [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay     [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller     [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone     [*]Not able to create our own perk package     [*]Disconnected from Steam     [*]The price     [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession [/list]  [b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b] [list]     [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash     [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike     [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game     [*]Unregistered hits such as melee     [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason     [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes     [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes     [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned [/list]  And the list goes on.  [hr][/hr]  [h1] Long Version [/h1]  [h3] Multiplayer [/h3]  Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.  [hr][/hr]  [h3] DMZ [/h3]  They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.  [hr][/hr]  [h3] Warzone [/h3]  Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.   You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.  [b] IW Realism Logic [/b] [list]     [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots     [*]Melee > Bullets     [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage     [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes     [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars     [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time [/list]  Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  [h1] Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it: [/h1]  [list] [*][b]What is it exactly that you do in the game?[/b]  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.  [*][b] Will it make my eyes bleed?[/b]  For $70 a game released in 2022… it’s not that graphically impressive… Sure the whole appeal of CoD is to run as light as possible so you can get 100+ FPS in the multiplayer and have low latency. But even if you max out the game it’s not that impressive. At release I found several low textures and the game still suffers from random popping on arbitrary objects for no rhyme or reason and… I don’t know if this is an AMD GPUs problem but I never managed to get rid of the film grain on my game. I even disabled image sharpening and antialiasing and I still had this effect on my screen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6e5HSU0yfU The cut scenes are by far the best part of the game. They are beautifully animated with amazing performance and great direction. But besides that, the game looks decent and at some points even impressive but… not $70 impressive.  [*][b]Does it have a good story?[/b]  I don’t know if I would call it “good”... To be fair I wouldn't consider it “bad” either. CoDMW2’s story is the excuse that the game gives you to travel around the world and kill terrorist and narcos. That’s it.  You never learn much about the characters beyond surface level stuff and they never grow or change… and the plot is a bunch of random stuff that you’re not supposed to question. It feels like watching a youtube supercut of the “coolest” bits of a Michael Bay movie.  [*][b]Does it have a good soundtrack?[/b]  I don’t even remember if CoDMW2 has an OST and youtube only has the track for the main theme.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPrqIgVpYrk  Soo… I don’t know.  [*][b]Does it have replay value?[/b]  Only if you are an achievement hunter. CoDMW2 offers you really cool achievements for you to unlock. My favorite is the one you get by killing enemies with a riot shield.  [*][b]Does it run well?[/b]  Well, the game runs flawlessly most of the time. But this game doesn’t run as smooth as I would have liked. I already mentioned random popping. But there are random frame drops as low as 19 FPS when the game loads new assets. And I have to mention that an update broke my save file and I had to restart the campaign again.  [*][b]Is it fun?[/b]  Only if you like CoD games.  [/list]  [h1] So what is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2?[/h1]  It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.   [h1] Things that I like about this game:[/h1]  [list] [*]Amazing gun play. CoD never disappoints with their gunplay.  [*]Great controller support.  [*]Decent yet a bit outdated graphics.  [*]Amazing cut scenes.  [*]Some missions are fantastic and so much fun to play.  [*]Great voice acting.  [*]The twist near the end is quite decent.  [*]The story is just “there”, it’s not bad but I definitely don’t hate it.  [/list]   [h1] Things that I dislike about this game:[/h1]  [list]  [*]A bit buggy and glitchy  [*]The characters are kind of bland.  [*]The AI is not great.  [*]I don’t like how this game thinks “challange” is throwing lots of armored enemies at you.  [*]I don’t like how the final boss is just an extended stealth section.  [*]The only boss in the game is a bit frustrating.   [/list] [h1] Is this game worth my hard earned money?[/h1]  For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent."

One good game, and you'll get thrown in a lobby of nothing but streamers and campers and it takes at least 3 trash games to get your KD back low enough for you to actually face people on your level again. The skill based matchmaking is garbage that no one asked for that only serves to punish casual gamers by letting them be destroyed by campers and try hards for having the audacity to do well for a game. If this is the direction they're going in, i can't say i'm gonna get another COD game."
179100454,english,0,1938090,"This game crashes constantly.

177846664,english,0,1938090,"I'd really like to know who the people continuing to push the COD launcher are at the top of Activision, what their roles are, and how long they've been decision makers.  Literally no one likes it and the fact that games restart multiple times when switching between them renders the concept of all games being on the same launcher screen useless.  All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games.  Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place.  Warzone exists because of Fortnite.  Really we should be blaming EPIC Games for the COD launcher; maybe the heads of Activision believe enough microtransaction slop and confusing menu screens will make their game as profitable as Fortnite.  We'll see."
142306908,english,0,1938090,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!  After investing hundreds of hours playing, buying ingame credits and thoroughly enjoying this product, I have become one of the countless people innocently perma banned for ""modifying the software"". There is no way to appeal this, get unbanned or even talk with a person. Most disturbing is that now access to the single player campaign mode is also blocked!  While the game itself is a classic, I highly DO NOT recommend buying or investing ANY money in this product as a system crash, any number of unrelated 3rd party software or thier own game crashing, allow the company to unilaterally deny you access to a game you purchased. And, this potentially contaminates any linked account or store (like Steam) you use, even other platforms.  Before buying, DO YOUR RESEARCH!! Or just stick to the free version and be prepared to just chuck it. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY this product. Waste of time, waste of money, atrocious customer service bordering on theft."
143029790,english,0,1938090,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their dogshit anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed. This may be a bit of a slow process as I am moving to university soon but it is not forgotten!"
147248687,english,0,1938090,"Dopamine slot machine. They know what they need to do to fix this franchise but they refuse to do so because CoD isn't about player enjoyment anymore, it's about metrics driven player engagement - even if that means alienating their core fan-base and fracturing the community with EOMM algorithms that are wound so tight you just yo-yo between skill bands.   IW is a terrible developer, won't be buying anymore of their titles from here forward."
147737651,english,0,1938090,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.

192539147,english,0,1938090,"Call of Duty — A Masterclass in Disappointment Ah, Call of Duty. The game franchise that somehow manages to release the same game every single year, slap a different name on it, and still charge full price like it’s the second coming of gaming innovation.  Gameplay? Copy + Paste. Every year it's:  Sprint → Slide → Jump → Die to some 12-year-old halfway across the world bunny-hopping with an MP5.  Respawn → Get killed by a camper in the corner → Rage.  That’s the real Call of Duty cycle. Forget skill — this game rewards whoever can mount their gun on a window ledge faster than you can say ""broken hitboxes.""  Maps? Recycled Garbage. Remember that one map you liked from 10 years ago? Surprise, it's back! Only now it’s somehow worse. Either it's littered with a million objects that block movement or wide open fields where snipers thrive like mosquitoes in summer.  Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) — aka SweatFest 3000 Trying to have fun? Not in this economy. The game sees you do well for ONE match and suddenly throws you into lobbies with professional esports wannabes rocking headsets more expensive than your console.  Microtransactions — The Real MVP Want a cool skin? $20. Want that same skin but in a slightly different color? Another $20. Want to actually feel like content isn’t locked behind a paywall? Too bad.  It’s like they sat in a meeting and said, ""How can we charge players for basic fun?""  Warzone? More like Bugzone. Cheaters, invisible skins, broken guns, game crashes — it’s like a free-to-play FPS mixed with a beta test nobody asked for. Every patch fixes 1 bug and adds 3 new ones.  Final Verdict: Call of Duty isn’t a game anymore — it’s a $70 annual subscription to rage, sweat, and disappointment. But somehow... we all keep playing it. And that’s probably the biggest scam of all."

149792487,english,0,1938090,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back."

Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace.  2) Activision is a shit company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven asshole after I've just taken a shit. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like shit. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced shit bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're fucking stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of shit, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again.  15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

Game continually causes a major system error that blue screens my system, and it seems to stem from the kernel level anticheat COD is using. Only solution I've been able to find online requires the user to disable some very important kernel protections on the system; this is an absolutely ridiculous issue given that their anti-cheat is already a poor excuse for preventing hacking.

Removed the game completely from my account. Don't even want to be reminded of the constant trap I keep falling into each year with this dogsht mediocre franchise.   Do not waste your money on this game and especially avoid the battlepass/premium shit like I did. Its predatory and all the premium content is just overpriced designs for operators I have no connection too while baiting another 100 mile battlepass grind that is just lackluster in sht content. Progression is insanely slow and there is a premium version of the premium battlepass. Yes you read that correctly. You get all the contexts of the premium battlepass that you  JUST bought but an extra $20 and you will get the same contents but will have another color with particle affects of the same skin/design.  BIG BIG BIG issue for me personally is too many ****ing menus, tabs, buttons to press things on the screen. You open the ****ing game and god forbid you press anything cause every button somehow opens a menu.. Who actually designed this UI???. Its like looking at a gas station bathroom wall of ADVERTISEMENTS of the very game you are playing at that moment. The UI is just absolutely horrendous whoever designed this UI just completely needs to be fired and never rehired for anything pertaining to ****ing UI. There is no actual way they thought the UI was good.   Just don't buy this game please. This company must actually believe we are all idiots or they are idiots themselves.

All hitmarkers"" and when they hit me with a lower caliber gun the same amount of fucking times it just erases my existence?   I just cannot have fun on here. Even as a team anymore. With the SBMM and EOMM, I get punished immediately if I do slightly good in a match, by being thrown in matches with people that just shit on me the entire time.  People complain that movement is slow and terrible, but it's not. If it was, then explain why sliding and shooting around corners, or jumping and shooting is the strategy. Movement is still super fast and fucking stupid just like before. Shields and knives are near impossible to counter. Their feet are covered, can't flank because they will rush and kill you. Can't throw because they will counter throw faster somehow or just rush and kill you. Thanks. All I want is to jump into matches and have fun. No, not just stomp everyone, that's not fun. I want to have fun. I want varied lobbies, showing that people aren't just bots. It doesn't help that the aim assist actually tracks for you, with no limitations on distance or if there are particle effects in the way or not. If your aim starts to move on it's own, you just aim and fire and you're gonna get the kill. I position myself better and shoot first? Doesn't matter. Enemy moves around, causing me to have to MANUALLY track them with my mouse and eyes, while controlling recoil with particle effects and camera shake. While they can just slightly tilt R stick down and fire. Flinch? Damn right that I do but when you have aim assist, the tracking pretty much counters it. There's nothing fun about it. I am only playing it for fear of missing out, and since I already bought the damn thing. The campaign was fun but that alone isn't worth what I paid. I am not ok, and this game is making shit worse. It is infuriating, by design. I can't even get good games anymore. What is the new ""good"" for me is if I am close to breaking even. Before I could maybe 1 in 10 rounds get one where I actually do good. Now it's just getting wrecked at spawn, or instant snap turned from someone who heard me moving across the map and has UAV that works through Ghost. Or, I shoot someone first, hit them twice, and they snap and melt me with their braindead controller aim assist."
174390067,english,0,1938090,"This launcher is absolutely terrible, utterly annoying, an insurmountable pain in the ass. In order to play the BO6 open beta I had to do the following: - Download the BO6 open beta, which also downloaded MW2 mp, which I own; - Open the Call of Duty launcher; - Restart the launcher because of an update, after which it started crashing; - After a few tries, I managed to start the launcher once again, after which it required another restart; - Finally I managed to arrive in the interface where I could select Black Ops 6 Open Beta, which I did; - The Call of Duty launcher closed and BO6 started loading; - After BO6 loaded, it required another restart because of an update; - After the restart, I got an error regarding the loading of player stats, which forced me to quit to desktop.  How the hell is this possible?  Even if I somehow manage to play this godforsaken demo, why would I buy this abomination if I have to go through such a hassle in order to play it?  I will probably uninstall MW2, perhaps this will help, because otherwise I have to go through almost the same process once again.  Edit: So I managed to play it and other that the occasional typical sweaty hyperactive players, it is quite enjoyable. However, I would still not recommend it. After every update it still requires you to restart the game after opening the CoD launcher and selecting BO6 which closes the CoD launcher and opens BO6. It's stupid that they did not change this since MW1 reboot. At least make it check for the update and restart it faster, perhaps upon opening the launcher, not after 1 minute wasted in the loading screens."

This game is gorgeous, the atmosphere, weapons, animations, and characters are on another level 2. The gunplay is fantastic. Everything feels very real, and the guns are fun to use 3. The campaign is a lot of fun with some great missions and overall better character development than the original MW2. 4. The multiplayer, WHEN BALANCED, is a lot of fun to play HOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with this game. 1. Breaking up lobbies to readjust for SBMM not only penalizes the player for playing well, it also doesn't give a chance for people to build rivalries or community with other players like in older CODs. 2. The aim assist on the controller is mind numbing. The fact that I switched to a controller and am overall playing better is a bad sign. 3. The main menu/UI in this game has to be the worst I have ever seen. 4. Weapon balancing is desperately needed.  Overall, I recommend because the problems with the game can be solved and I see at least a couple of them being resolved in the next few patches. But jfc, it needs work."

149713623,english,1,1938090,"Nvm game wanna learn how to make atom bomb? First, a PhD level of training in metallurgy to determine all of the different metals and alloys needed to fabricate the parts of the bomb. PhD level training in nuclear physics to determine exactly what isotopes and how much will be needed and, of course, exactly in what shape they will be needed. A PhD level of training in explosives to determine what type and how much explosive will be needed for the various non-nuclear parts of the bomb. A Tool and Die level of expertise as a machinist to fabricate the parts correctly for the bomb. So far all of these areas of expertise are readily available. A couple of lifetimes of study will get you there. Naturally, you will also need a (very) nice machine shop to fabricate your device.  Now comes the more difficult part: getting fissile material. This type of material is usually available only from nation states. I have checked at Walmart, and they didn’t seem to stock it, so buying enough is going to be a problem. A big problem. A very big problem. In fact, an insurmountable problem. Fissile material is MUCH better protected than gold, and many times more expensive. So, even if you can overcome the various expertise requirements, you will have a very, very big problem getting the fissile material. However, that is just one of many problems I will leave to the ambitious bomb maker to solve.  Were you to decide to make your own fissile material, you would need to decide whether to use U235 or Pu239. In either case, you will need many tons of uranium metal, a purchase of which may draw the attention of various 3 letter agencies. This will be a fundamental decision since they are made in completely different ways. The U235 route will require thousands of ultra-centrifuges with a HUGE power plant to run them, while the Pu239 will require a nuclear reactor. Both will require very large laboratories for the industrial separation of the different highly radioactive isotopes. Just a couple more problems for the inveterate bomb maker to solve.  It might also be noted that were you to somehow manage to acquire said fissile material, there would be quite a number of agencies interested in how you got it, where it is, and just what you were planning to do with it. The FBI, CIA, MI5, KGB (or whatever their current name is) Mossad, and a few others come to mind. These tend to be (very) unfriendly and also very curious. Their methods of getting answers may not be pleasant, but since you will probably never be seen again after their visit, I would consider that aspect your personal problem, and, again, one for you to solve in due course.  So, there are a few challenges to making your own home made atomic bomb. However, with enough determination and money, you might succeed. I don’t recommend you try this at home, though. And don’t forget your neighbors won’t appreciate your testing it, either."

If you love roller coasters, you’re in for a ride — because this game crashes more often than a demolition derby! Seriously, I’ve seen more stability in a Jenga tower built by toddlers than in this game.  Let’s talk about the gameplay. Oh wait, I can’t — because 80% of the time, you’re dealing with tryhards, cheaters and or babies. Some guys must have IV drips of energy drinks, because they play like their lives depend on it. One moment you’re respawning, the next you’re a target dummy for some sweat-soaked, basement-dwelling pro who’s clearly forgotten what sunlight looks like. The matchmaking is a tragedy for new players.  And don't get me started on the servers. Imagine trying to play a game while surfing the internet on a potato. Yup, that’s pretty much the experience. Lag spikes that could launch you to the moon, disconnects that make you question your Wi-Fi provider, and enough glitches to make you think you’re in a Matrix sequel.

177481296,english,1,1938090,"This game is intended solely for the most resolute individuals, those who perhaps grapple with certain inner afflictions. It is teeming with various groups of challengers: there are the relentless ""sweats,"" forever straining to outdo one another; the so-called ""movement demons,"" whose every action seems designed to bewilder and outmaneuver; and, of course, the perennial campers, who seem to find joy in hiding within a building for the entire match, only to claim victory with a paltry two team eliminations (a strategy which, I must confess, I utterly despise).  However, beyond these troublesome opponents, one of the most lamentable and regressive issues within the game is the overly harsh toxicity filter, with penalties that are grossly disproportionate to the offense. What we seek is a space where we may express our frustrations freely—where we can curse our enemies with full force, so as to avoid destroying our own equipment in sheer frustration. Yet, Activision has decided to sanitize the community to such a degree that genuine in-game communication has nearly vanished, save for the occasional child whose voice emerges amidst the clamor of their parents' quarrels in the background.  Moreover, Activision, I feel assured that I speak on behalf of the entire original community—the veteran players who have consistently spent their hard-earned money on a game that, in truth, changes but little with each passing year, overseen by certain spoiled and aging executives (whose indulgent misdeeds have been laid bare through well-known leaks). We categorically reject the imposition of a voice chat filter that, after a single warning, silences players—barring communication for weeks, months, or even indefinitely. We do not pay for a service merely to have our freedoms so unjustly curtailed.  I did not intend to offend the team or any individual, but my patience is wearing thin. As I hold out hope that you are making a positive shift with BO6 and sincerely listening to the community, I ask that you take this request to heart.  Thank you, Your dear Traziverse"

I believe negative reviews are coming from cod haters of players who havn’t adjusted yet, but from someone who has played every call of duty since beginning this one brings in great game play, a refresh with a unique vibe, and some of the best performance and memory utilization yet especially on PC.

I admit the gunplay is excellent and engaging, but after investing over 200 hours each in MWII (2022) and MWIII (2023), the gameplay hasn't justified the time and money spent. There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.

129131029,english,0,1938090,"[h1] Not worth it. At all. [/h1]  Ever since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You're simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.  Skill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I'm playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it's the same scenario since the game got released.   Also, if there is a ""ranked"" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn't the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?  Extra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I'm getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?  For some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don't know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can't emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can't bother calling it aim assist anymore, it's Aimbot. For real it's aimbot. You'll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you're slightly next to their crosshair, you're done. They don't even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there's no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.  I get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they're using just their thumbs to aim, but I don't want to be a part of this. I don't want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he'll be able to get kills. It's simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it's not possible? Isn't the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & Battle.net combo?  Some TL:DR for you: [b]Pros:[/b] - Good Gunplay - Good Animations - Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons - Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock - AMD's FSR works pretty well  [b]Cons:[/b] - SBMM - No Crossplay opt-out choice - Inconsistent footsteps & audio - No Stopping Power as a perk - No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk - Matches feel rigged  *Edit 18/08/2024*  So after many extra hours and upon reaching max level, the more time I spent playing this, the more it reinforced what I and many others have already said before.  To sum it up, I'll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience I've had with this game this one year and a half:   Me and one of my friends are playing Prisoner Rescue for a two hour session in the night. First hour goes fine, we're both making good scores and we have a 7 game win-streak, we're seeing some new players and some old, matches play fine with no problem, nothing out of the ordinary happening.   Now the second hour we're playing, we're starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game. We're getting teammates that are acting like they're playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives, while the enemy team is either a 4 stack, a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend. It's a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over.   Our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual, hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend, enemy weapons get such a fast TTK it feels like a single-frame death, meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone. I was using G3A3 and my friend was using SCAR-H, and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a Battle-Rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range. Also packet loss (white color) and packet burst (orange color) was appearing every few seconds for both of us, but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session. And of course let's not forget, the enemies we're fighting have below 10 ping, meanwhile my friend is at 40 and I'm at 60.  The game's algorithm is literally nerfing you in real time, sacrificing your experience in order to make the opponent's better. It's trying really hard to keep you as close to 1 K/D and 1 W/L as possible, with whatever means it has available. Activision is known to take the fun out of their games the moment you show them you're above average and can actually play good.  People who defend this and act as if me or my friend are the problem, they're the same people getting gaslighted by the same algorithm they protect, because they're so garbage they end up playing on protected brackets of matchmaking in order to spend more money for skins.  If you still think this franchise has a chance for redemption, you are another fool of consumerism and you deserve every ultra-low quality products you're getting from these companies."

Ever feel like one day you're on a roll, but the next day you can't win a single game? There's a reason for that.  Here's one quote from Activision's EOMM patent they renewed in 2019 ([url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US10857468B2]source[/url]):  [quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2]      ...responsive to a determination that the first player purchased the in-game item, the player profile may be updated to reflect the purchase and [b]the first player may be matched to play a second gameplay session[/b] in which the in-game item is suitable to be used.      For example, if the in-game item is a weapon (e.g., an accurate and powerful sniper rifle), the second gameplay session may be selected because the weapon is highly effective in the second gameplay session. Doing so [b]may encourage the first player to make subsequent purchases[/b] due to the satisfaction of effectively using the in-game item during the second gameplay session. [/quote]  TL;DR: Microtransactions directly influence matchmaking, rather than skill.   Not enough? Here's Activison's argument for why EOMM was necessary over SBMM:  [quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2]  Conventional systems further fail to leverage matchmaking processes in other contexts, [b]such as influencing game-related purchases[/b], suggesting group formations, training/identifying non-player characters, and/or otherwise extending the use of the matchmaking process. These and other drawbacks exist with current matchmaking processes utilized in multiplayer video games. [/quote]  This game is manipulating you. It doesn't care about how good you are.

144525086,english,0,1938090,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.   The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.   You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

Lets go back to the days of unamed soldiers, on a map that has actually been designed well, and just play PvP.

132572501,english,0,1938090,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this."

125240902,english,0,1938090,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:     There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.   These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.   I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  Fuck you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too."

130754141,english,0,1938090,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b] [b] Pros: [/b] [list]     [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.     [*]Weapon tuning     [*]Al Mazrah     [*]New battle pass and backpack system     [*]Proximity chat     [*]3rd person modes [/list]  [b] Cons: [/b] [list]     [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps     [*]Movement     [*]UI     [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask     [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product     [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting     [*]TTK (Time To Kill)     [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game     [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy     [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps     [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map     [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay     [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller     [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone     [*]Not able to create our own perk package     [*]Disconnected from Steam     [*]The price     [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession [/list]  [b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b] [list]     [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash     [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike     [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game     [*]Unregistered hits such as melee     [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason     [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes     [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes     [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned [/list]  And the list goes on.  [hr][/hr]  [h1] Long Version [/h1]  [h3] Multiplayer [/h3]  Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.  [hr][/hr]  [h3] DMZ [/h3]  They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.  [hr][/hr]  [h3] Warzone [/h3]  Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.   You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.  [b] IW Realism Logic [/b] [list]     [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots     [*]Melee > Bullets     [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage     [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes     [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars     [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time [/list]  Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  [h1] Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it: [/h1]  [list] [*][b]What is it exactly that you do in the game?[/b]  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.  [*][b] Will it make my eyes bleed?[/b]  For $70 a game released in 2022… it’s not that graphically impressive… Sure the whole appeal of CoD is to run as light as possible so you can get 100+ FPS in the multiplayer and have low latency. But even if you max out the game it’s not that impressive. At release I found several low textures and the game still suffers from random popping on arbitrary objects for no rhyme or reason and… I don’t know if this is an AMD GPUs problem but I never managed to get rid of the film grain on my game. I even disabled image sharpening and antialiasing and I still had this effect on my screen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6e5HSU0yfU The cut scenes are by far the best part of the game. They are beautifully animated with amazing performance and great direction. But besides that, the game looks decent and at some points even impressive but… not $70 impressive.  [*][b]Does it have a good story?[/b]  I don’t know if I would call it “good”... To be fair I wouldn't consider it “bad” either. CoDMW2’s story is the excuse that the game gives you to travel around the world and kill terrorist and narcos. That’s it.  You never learn much about the characters beyond surface level stuff and they never grow or change… and the plot is a bunch of random stuff that you’re not supposed to question. It feels like watching a youtube supercut of the “coolest” bits of a Michael Bay movie.  [*][b]Does it have a good soundtrack?[/b]  I don’t even remember if CoDMW2 has an OST and youtube only has the track for the main theme.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPrqIgVpYrk  Soo… I don’t know.  [*][b]Does it have replay value?[/b]  Only if you are an achievement hunter. CoDMW2 offers you really cool achievements for you to unlock. My favorite is the one you get by killing enemies with a riot shield.  [*][b]Does it run well?[/b]  Well, the game runs flawlessly most of the time. But this game doesn’t run as smooth as I would have liked. I already mentioned random popping. But there are random frame drops as low as 19 FPS when the game loads new assets. And I have to mention that an update broke my save file and I had to restart the campaign again.  [*][b]Is it fun?[/b]  Only if you like CoD games.  [/list]  [h1] So what is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2?[/h1]  It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.   [h1] Things that I like about this game:[/h1]  [list] [*]Amazing gun play. CoD never disappoints with their gunplay.  [*]Great controller support.  [*]Decent yet a bit outdated graphics.  [*]Amazing cut scenes.  [*]Some missions are fantastic and so much fun to play.  [*]Great voice acting.  [*]The twist near the end is quite decent.  [*]The story is just “there”, it’s not bad but I definitely don’t hate it.  [/list]   [h1] Things that I dislike about this game:[/h1]  [list]  [*]A bit buggy and glitchy  [*]The characters are kind of bland.  [*]The AI is not great.  [*]I don’t like how this game thinks “challange” is throwing lots of armored enemies at you.  [*]I don’t like how the final boss is just an extended stealth section.  [*]The only boss in the game is a bit frustrating.   [/list] [h1] Is this game worth my hard earned money?[/h1]  For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent."

I think people purchasing this Service, as that's technically what it is, should know that Activision is actively, pun intended, breaching privacy beyond the scope of what the game is required to. This is illegal under 18 U.S.C. Section 2511 because likely, this is done without public knowledge.

One good game, and you'll get thrown in a lobby of nothing but streamers and campers and it takes at least 3 trash games to get your KD back low enough for you to actually face people on your level again. The skill based matchmaking is garbage that no one asked for that only serves to punish casual gamers by letting them be destroyed by campers and try hards for having the audacity to do well for a game. If this is the direction they're going in, i can't say i'm gonna get another COD game."
179100454,english,0,1938090,"This game crashes constantly.

177846664,english,0,1938090,"I'd really like to know who the people continuing to push the COD launcher are at the top of Activision, what their roles are, and how long they've been decision makers.  Literally no one likes it and the fact that games restart multiple times when switching between them renders the concept of all games being on the same launcher screen useless.  All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games.  Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place.  Warzone exists because of Fortnite.  Really we should be blaming EPIC Games for the COD launcher; maybe the heads of Activision believe enough microtransaction slop and confusing menu screens will make their game as profitable as Fortnite.  We'll see."
142306908,english,0,1938090,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!  After investing hundreds of hours playing, buying ingame credits and thoroughly enjoying this product, I have become one of the countless people innocently perma banned for ""modifying the software"". There is no way to appeal this, get unbanned or even talk with a person. Most disturbing is that now access to the single player campaign mode is also blocked!  While the game itself is a classic, I highly DO NOT recommend buying or investing ANY money in this product as a system crash, any number of unrelated 3rd party software or thier own game crashing, allow the company to unilaterally deny you access to a game you purchased. And, this potentially contaminates any linked account or store (like Steam) you use, even other platforms.  Before buying, DO YOUR RESEARCH!! Or just stick to the free version and be prepared to just chuck it. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY this product. Waste of time, waste of money, atrocious customer service bordering on theft."
143029790,english,0,1938090,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their dogshit anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed. This may be a bit of a slow process as I am moving to university soon but it is not forgotten!"
147248687,english,0,1938090,"Dopamine slot machine. They know what they need to do to fix this franchise but they refuse to do so because CoD isn't about player enjoyment anymore, it's about metrics driven player engagement - even if that means alienating their core fan-base and fracturing the community with EOMM algorithms that are wound so tight you just yo-yo between skill bands.   IW is a terrible developer, won't be buying anymore of their titles from here forward."
147737651,english,0,1938090,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.

192539147,english,0,1938090,"Call of Duty — A Masterclass in Disappointment Ah, Call of Duty. The game franchise that somehow manages to release the same game every single year, slap a different name on it, and still charge full price like it’s the second coming of gaming innovation.  Gameplay? Copy + Paste. Every year it's:  Sprint → Slide → Jump → Die to some 12-year-old halfway across the world bunny-hopping with an MP5.  Respawn → Get killed by a camper in the corner → Rage.  That’s the real Call of Duty cycle. Forget skill — this game rewards whoever can mount their gun on a window ledge faster than you can say ""broken hitboxes.""  Maps? Recycled Garbage. Remember that one map you liked from 10 years ago? Surprise, it's back! Only now it’s somehow worse. Either it's littered with a million objects that block movement or wide open fields where snipers thrive like mosquitoes in summer.  Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) — aka SweatFest 3000 Trying to have fun? Not in this economy. The game sees you do well for ONE match and suddenly throws you into lobbies with professional esports wannabes rocking headsets more expensive than your console.  Microtransactions — The Real MVP Want a cool skin? $20. Want that same skin but in a slightly different color? Another $20. Want to actually feel like content isn’t locked behind a paywall? Too bad.  It’s like they sat in a meeting and said, ""How can we charge players for basic fun?""  Warzone? More like Bugzone. Cheaters, invisible skins, broken guns, game crashes — it’s like a free-to-play FPS mixed with a beta test nobody asked for. Every patch fixes 1 bug and adds 3 new ones.  Final Verdict: Call of Duty isn’t a game anymore — it’s a $70 annual subscription to rage, sweat, and disappointment. But somehow... we all keep playing it. And that’s probably the biggest scam of all."

149792487,english,0,1938090,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back."
143425476,english,0,1938090,"I would write a full review, but I'd rather not spend more time on this game than I already have.  Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace.  2) Activision is a shit company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven asshole after I've just taken a shit. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like shit. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced shit bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're fucking stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of shit, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again.  15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

Do not waste your money on this game and especially avoid the battlepass/premium shit like I did. Its predatory and all the premium content is just overpriced designs for operators I have no connection too while baiting another 100 mile battlepass grind that is just lackluster in sht content.

You get all the contexts of the premium battlepass that you  JUST bought but an extra $20 and you will get the same contents but will have another color with particle affects of the same skin/design.  BIG BIG BIG issue for me personally is too many ****ing menus, tabs, buttons to press things on the screen. You open the ****ing game and god forbid you press anything cause every button somehow opens a menu.. Who actually designed this UI???. Its like looking at a gas station bathroom wall of ADVERTISEMENTS of the very game you are playing at that moment.

All hitmarkers"" and when they hit me with a lower caliber gun the same amount of fucking times it just erases my existence?   I just cannot have fun on here. Even as a team anymore. With the SBMM and EOMM, I get punished immediately if I do slightly good in a match, by being thrown in matches with people that just shit on me the entire time.  People complain that movement is slow and terrible, but it's not. If it was, then explain why sliding and shooting around corners, or jumping and shooting is the strategy. Movement is still super fast and fucking stupid just like before. Shields and knives are near impossible to counter. Their feet are covered, can't flank because they will rush and kill you. Can't throw because they will counter throw faster somehow or just rush and kill you. Thanks. All I want is to jump into matches and have fun. No, not just stomp everyone, that's not fun. I want to have fun. I want varied lobbies, showing that people aren't just bots. It doesn't help that the aim assist actually tracks for you, with no limitations on distance or if there are particle effects in the way or not. If your aim starts to move on it's own, you just aim and fire and you're gonna get the kill. I position myself better and shoot first? Doesn't matter. Enemy moves around, causing me to have to MANUALLY track them with my mouse and eyes, while controlling recoil with particle effects and camera shake. While they can just slightly tilt R stick down and fire. Flinch? Damn right that I do but when you have aim assist, the tracking pretty much counters it. There's nothing fun about it. I am only playing it for fear of missing out, and since I already bought the damn thing. The campaign was fun but that alone isn't worth what I paid. I am not ok, and this game is making shit worse. It is infuriating, by design. I can't even get good games anymore. What is the new ""good"" for me is if I am close to breaking even. Before I could maybe 1 in 10 rounds get one where I actually do good. Now it's just getting wrecked at spawn, or instant snap turned from someone who heard me moving across the map and has UAV that works through Ghost.

174390067,english,0,1938090,"This launcher is absolutely terrible, utterly annoying, an insurmountable pain in the ass. In order to play the BO6 open beta I had to do the following: - Download the BO6 open beta, which also downloaded MW2 mp, which I own; - Open the Call of Duty launcher; - Restart the launcher because of an update, after which it started crashing; - After a few tries, I managed to start the launcher once again, after which it required another restart; - Finally I managed to arrive in the interface where I could select Black Ops 6 Open Beta, which I did; - The Call of Duty launcher closed and BO6 started loading; - After BO6 loaded, it required another restart because of an update; - After the restart, I got an error regarding the loading of player stats, which forced me to quit to desktop.  How the hell is this possible?  Even if I somehow manage to play this godforsaken demo, why would I buy this abomination if I have to go through such a hassle in order to play it?  I will probably uninstall MW2, perhaps this will help, because otherwise I have to go through almost the same process once again.  Edit: So I managed to play it and other that the occasional typical sweaty hyperactive players, it is quite enjoyable. However, I would still not recommend it. After every update it still requires you to restart the game after opening the CoD launcher and selecting BO6 which closes the CoD launcher and opens BO6. It's stupid that they did not change this since MW1 reboot. At least make it check for the update and restart it faster, perhaps upon opening the launcher, not after 1 minute wasted in the loading screens."

The campaign is a lot of fun with some great missions and overall better character development than the original MW2. 4. The multiplayer, WHEN BALANCED, is a lot of fun to play HOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with this game. 1. Breaking up lobbies to readjust for SBMM not only penalizes the player for playing well, it also doesn't give a chance for people to build rivalries or community with other players like in older CODs. 2. The aim assist on the controller is mind numbing. The fact that I switched to a controller and am overall playing better is a bad sign. 3. The main menu/UI in this game has to be the worst I have ever seen. 4. Weapon balancing is desperately needed.

149713623,english,1,1938090,"Nvm game wanna learn how to make atom bomb? First, a PhD level of training in metallurgy to determine all of the different metals and alloys needed to fabricate the parts of the bomb. PhD level training in nuclear physics to determine exactly what isotopes and how much will be needed and, of course, exactly in what shape they will be needed. A PhD level of training in explosives to determine what type and how much explosive will be needed for the various non-nuclear parts of the bomb. A Tool and Die level of expertise as a machinist to fabricate the parts correctly for the bomb. So far all of these areas of expertise are readily available. A couple of lifetimes of study will get you there. Naturally, you will also need a (very) nice machine shop to fabricate your device.  Now comes the more difficult part: getting fissile material. This type of material is usually available only from nation states. I have checked at Walmart, and they didn’t seem to stock it, so buying enough is going to be a problem. A big problem. A very big problem. In fact, an insurmountable problem. Fissile material is MUCH better protected than gold, and many times more expensive. So, even if you can overcome the various expertise requirements, you will have a very, very big problem getting the fissile material. However, that is just one of many problems I will leave to the ambitious bomb maker to solve.  Were you to decide to make your own fissile material, you would need to decide whether to use U235 or Pu239. In either case, you will need many tons of uranium metal, a purchase of which may draw the attention of various 3 letter agencies. This will be a fundamental decision since they are made in completely different ways. The U235 route will require thousands of ultra-centrifuges with a HUGE power plant to run them, while the Pu239 will require a nuclear reactor. Both will require very large laboratories for the industrial separation of the different highly radioactive isotopes. Just a couple more problems for the inveterate bomb maker to solve.  It might also be noted that were you to somehow manage to acquire said fissile material, there would be quite a number of agencies interested in how you got it, where it is, and just what you were planning to do with it. The FBI, CIA, MI5, KGB (or whatever their current name is) Mossad, and a few others come to mind. These tend to be (very) unfriendly and also very curious. Their methods of getting answers may not be pleasant, but since you will probably never be seen again after their visit, I would consider that aspect your personal problem, and, again, one for you to solve in due course.  So, there are a few challenges to making your own home made atomic bomb. However, with enough determination and money, you might succeed. I don’t recommend you try this at home, though. And don’t forget your neighbors won’t appreciate your testing it, either."

177481296,english,1,1938090,"This game is intended solely for the most resolute individuals, those who perhaps grapple with certain inner afflictions. It is teeming with various groups of challengers: there are the relentless ""sweats,"" forever straining to outdo one another; the so-called ""movement demons,"" whose every action seems designed to bewilder and outmaneuver; and, of course, the perennial campers, who seem to find joy in hiding within a building for the entire match, only to claim victory with a paltry two team eliminations (a strategy which, I must confess, I utterly despise).  However, beyond these troublesome opponents, one of the most lamentable and regressive issues within the game is the overly harsh toxicity filter, with penalties that are grossly disproportionate to the offense. What we seek is a space where we may express our frustrations freely—where we can curse our enemies with full force, so as to avoid destroying our own equipment in sheer frustration. Yet, Activision has decided to sanitize the community to such a degree that genuine in-game communication has nearly vanished, save for the occasional child whose voice emerges amidst the clamor of their parents' quarrels in the background.  Moreover, Activision, I feel assured that I speak on behalf of the entire original community—the veteran players who have consistently spent their hard-earned money on a game that, in truth, changes but little with each passing year, overseen by certain spoiled and aging executives (whose indulgent misdeeds have been laid bare through well-known leaks). We categorically reject the imposition of a voice chat filter that, after a single warning, silences players—barring communication for weeks, months, or even indefinitely. We do not pay for a service merely to have our freedoms so unjustly curtailed.  I did not intend to offend the team or any individual, but my patience is wearing thin.

Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.

129131029,english,0,1938090,"[h1] Not worth it. At all. [/h1]  Ever since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You're simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.  Skill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I'm playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it's the same scenario since the game got released.   Also, if there is a ""ranked"" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn't the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?  Extra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I'm getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?  For some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don't know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can't emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can't bother calling it aim assist anymore, it's Aimbot. For real it's aimbot. You'll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you're slightly next to their crosshair, you're done. They don't even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there's no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.  I get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they're using just their thumbs to aim, but I don't want to be a part of this. I don't want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he'll be able to get kills. It's simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it's not possible? Isn't the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & Battle.net combo?  Some TL:DR for you: [b]Pros:[/b] - Good Gunplay - Good Animations - Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons - Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock - AMD's FSR works pretty well  [b]Cons:[/b] - SBMM - No Crossplay opt-out choice - Inconsistent footsteps & audio - No Stopping Power as a perk - No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk - Matches feel rigged  *Edit 18/08/2024*  So after many extra hours and upon reaching max level, the more time I spent playing this, the more it reinforced what I and many others have already said before.  To sum it up, I'll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience I've had with this game this one year and a half:   Me and one of my friends are playing Prisoner Rescue for a two hour session in the night. First hour goes fine, we're both making good scores and we have a 7 game win-streak, we're seeing some new players and some old, matches play fine with no problem, nothing out of the ordinary happening.   Now the second hour we're playing, we're starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game. We're getting teammates that are acting like they're playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives, while the enemy team is either a 4 stack, a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend. It's a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over.   Our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual, hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend, enemy weapons get such a fast TTK it feels like a single-frame death, meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone. I was using G3A3 and my friend was using SCAR-H, and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a Battle-Rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range. Also packet loss (white color) and packet burst (orange color) was appearing every few seconds for both of us, but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session. And of course let's not forget, the enemies we're fighting have below 10 ping, meanwhile my friend is at 40 and I'm at 60.  The game's algorithm is literally nerfing you in real time, sacrificing your experience in order to make the opponent's better. It's trying really hard to keep you as close to 1 K/D and 1 W/L as possible, with whatever means it has available. Activision is known to take the fun out of their games the moment you show them you're above average and can actually play good.  People who defend this and act as if me or my friend are the problem, they're the same people getting gaslighted by the same algorithm they protect, because they're so garbage they end up playing on protected brackets of matchmaking in order to spend more money for skins.  If you still think this franchise has a chance for redemption, you are another fool of consumerism and you deserve every ultra-low quality products you're getting from these companies."

Ever feel like one day you're on a roll, but the next day you can't win a single game? There's a reason for that.  Here's one quote from Activision's EOMM patent they renewed in 2019 ([url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US10857468B2]source[/url]):  [quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2]      ...responsive to a determination that the first player purchased the in-game item, the player profile may be updated to reflect the purchase and [b]the first player may be matched to play a second gameplay session[/b] in which the in-game item is suitable to be used.      For example, if the in-game item is a weapon (e.g., an accurate and powerful sniper rifle), the second gameplay session may be selected because the weapon is highly effective in the second gameplay session. Doing so [b]may encourage the first player to make subsequent purchases[/b] due to the satisfaction of effectively using the in-game item during the second gameplay session. [/quote]  TL;DR: Microtransactions directly influence matchmaking, rather than skill.   Not enough? Here's Activison's argument for why EOMM was necessary over SBMM:  [quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2]  Conventional systems further fail to leverage matchmaking processes in other contexts, [b]such as influencing game-related purchases[/b], suggesting group formations, training/identifying non-player characters, and/or otherwise extending the use of the matchmaking process. These and other drawbacks exist with current matchmaking processes utilized in multiplayer video games. [/quote]  This game is manipulating you. It doesn't care about how good you are. It doesn't care how much fun you have. It cares about your money, and Activision is willing to ruin your lobbies to get it.   The only way to win this game is to not play at all.

All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.   The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.   You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this."

125240902,english,0,1938090,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:     There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.   These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.   I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  Fuck you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too."

130754141,english,0,1938090,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b] [b] Pros: [/b] [list]     [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.     [*]Weapon tuning     [*]Al Mazrah     [*]New battle pass and backpack system     [*]Proximity chat     [*]3rd person modes [/list]  [b] Cons: [/b] [list]     [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps     [*]Movement     [*]UI     [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask     [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product     [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting     [*]TTK (Time To Kill)     [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game     [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy     [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps     [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map     [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay     [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller     [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone     [*]Not able to create our own perk package     [*]Disconnected from Steam     [*]The price     [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession [/list]  [b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b] [list]     [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash     [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike     [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game     [*]Unregistered hits such as melee     [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason     [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes     [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes     [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned [/list]  And the list goes on.  [hr][/hr]  [h1] Long Version [/h1]  [h3] Multiplayer [/h3]  Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.  [hr][/hr]  [h3] DMZ [/h3]  They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.  [hr][/hr]  [h3] Warzone [/h3]  Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.   You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.  [b] IW Realism Logic [/b] [list]     [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots     [*]Melee > Bullets     [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage     [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes     [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars     [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time [/list]  Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  [h1] Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it: [/h1]  [list] [*][b]What is it exactly that you do in the game?[/b]  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.  [*][b] Will it make my eyes bleed?[/b]  For $70 a game released in 2022… it’s not that graphically impressive… Sure the whole appeal of CoD is to run as light as possible so you can get 100+ FPS in the multiplayer and have low latency. But even if you max out the game it’s not that impressive. At release I found several low textures and the game still suffers from random popping on arbitrary objects for no rhyme or reason and… I don’t know if this is an AMD GPUs problem but I never managed to get rid of the film grain on my game. I even disabled image sharpening and antialiasing and I still had this effect on my screen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6e5HSU0yfU The cut scenes are by far the best part of the game. They are beautifully animated with amazing performance and great direction. But besides that, the game looks decent and at some points even impressive but… not $70 impressive.  [*][b]Does it have a good story?[/b]  I don’t know if I would call it “good”... To be fair I wouldn't consider it “bad” either. CoDMW2’s story is the excuse that the game gives you to travel around the world and kill terrorist and narcos. That’s it.  You never learn much about the characters beyond surface level stuff and they never grow or change… and the plot is a bunch of random stuff that you’re not supposed to question. It feels like watching a youtube supercut of the “coolest” bits of a Michael Bay movie.  [*][b]Does it have a good soundtrack?[/b]  I don’t even remember if CoDMW2 has an OST and youtube only has the track for the main theme.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPrqIgVpYrk  Soo… I don’t know.  [*][b]Does it have replay value?[/b]  Only if you are an achievement hunter. CoDMW2 offers you really cool achievements for you to unlock. My favorite is the one you get by killing enemies with a riot shield.  [*][b]Does it run well?[/b]  Well, the game runs flawlessly most of the time. But this game doesn’t run as smooth as I would have liked. I already mentioned random popping. But there are random frame drops as low as 19 FPS when the game loads new assets. And I have to mention that an update broke my save file and I had to restart the campaign again.  [*][b]Is it fun?[/b]  Only if you like CoD games.  [/list]  [h1] So what is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2?[/h1]  It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.   [h1] Things that I like about this game:[/h1]  [list] [*]Amazing gun play. CoD never disappoints with their gunplay.  [*]Great controller support.  [*]Decent yet a bit outdated graphics.  [*]Amazing cut scenes.  [*]Some missions are fantastic and so much fun to play.  [*]Great voice acting.  [*]The twist near the end is quite decent.  [*]The story is just “there”, it’s not bad but I definitely don’t hate it.  [/list]   [h1] Things that I dislike about this game:[/h1]  [list]  [*]A bit buggy and glitchy  [*]The characters are kind of bland.  [*]The AI is not great.  [*]I don’t like how this game thinks “challange” is throwing lots of armored enemies at you.  [*]I don’t like how the final boss is just an extended stealth section.  [*]The only boss in the game is a bit frustrating.   [/list] [h1] Is this game worth my hard earned money?[/h1]  For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent."

The skill based matchmaking is garbage that no one asked for that only serves to punish casual gamers by letting them be destroyed by campers and try hards for having the audacity to do well for a game.

177846664,english,0,1938090,"I'd really like to know who the people continuing to push the COD launcher are at the top of Activision, what their roles are, and how long they've been decision makers.  Literally no one likes it and the fact that games restart multiple times when switching between them renders the concept of all games being on the same launcher screen useless.  All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games.  Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place.  Warzone exists because of Fortnite.  Really we should be blaming EPIC Games for the COD launcher; maybe the heads of Activision believe enough microtransaction slop and confusing menu screens will make their game as profitable as Fortnite.  We'll see."

There is no way to appeal this, get unbanned or even talk with a person. Most disturbing is that now access to the single player campaign mode is also blocked!  While the game itself is a classic, I highly DO NOT recommend buying or investing ANY money in this product as a system crash, any number of unrelated 3rd party software or thier own game crashing, allow the company to unilaterally deny you access to a game you purchased. And, this potentially contaminates any linked account or store (like Steam) you use, even other platforms.  Before buying, DO YOUR RESEARCH!!

143029790,english,0,1938090,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their dogshit anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

They know what they need to do to fix this franchise but they refuse to do so because CoD isn't about player enjoyment anymore, it's about metrics driven player engagement - even if that means alienating their core fan-base and fracturing the community with EOMM algorithms that are wound so tight you just yo-yo between skill bands.   IW is a terrible developer, won't be buying anymore of their titles from here forward."
147737651,english,0,1938090,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.

192539147,english,0,1938090,"Call of Duty — A Masterclass in Disappointment Ah, Call of Duty. The game franchise that somehow manages to release the same game every single year, slap a different name on it, and still charge full price like it’s the second coming of gaming innovation.  Gameplay? Copy + Paste. Every year it's:  Sprint → Slide → Jump → Die to some 12-year-old halfway across the world bunny-hopping with an MP5.  Respawn → Get killed by a camper in the corner → Rage.  That’s the real Call of Duty cycle. Forget skill — this game rewards whoever can mount their gun on a window ledge faster than you can say ""broken hitboxes.""  Maps? Recycled Garbage. Remember that one map you liked from 10 years ago? Surprise, it's back! Only now it’s somehow worse. Either it's littered with a million objects that block movement or wide open fields where snipers thrive like mosquitoes in summer.  Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) — aka SweatFest 3000 Trying to have fun? Not in this economy. The game sees you do well for ONE match and suddenly throws you into lobbies with professional esports wannabes rocking headsets more expensive than your console.  Microtransactions — The Real MVP Want a cool skin? $20. Want that same skin but in a slightly different color? Another $20. Want to actually feel like content isn’t locked behind a paywall? Too bad.  It’s like they sat in a meeting and said, ""How can we charge players for basic fun?""  Warzone? More like Bugzone. Cheaters, invisible skins, broken guns, game crashes — it’s like a free-to-play FPS mixed with a beta test nobody asked for. Every patch fixes 1 bug and adds 3 new ones.  Final Verdict: Call of Duty isn’t a game anymore — it’s a $70 annual subscription to rage, sweat, and disappointment. But somehow... we all keep playing it. And that’s probably the biggest scam of all."

I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back."

Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace.  2) Activision is a shit company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven asshole after I've just taken a shit. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like shit. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced shit bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're fucking stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of shit, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again.  15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

Do not waste your money on this game and especially avoid the battlepass/premium shit like I did. Its predatory and all the premium content is just overpriced designs for operators I have no connection too while baiting another 100 mile battlepass grind that is just lackluster in sht content.

You get all the contexts of the premium battlepass that you  JUST bought but an extra $20 and you will get the same contents but will have another color with particle affects of the same skin/design.

All hitmarkers"" and when they hit me with a lower caliber gun the same amount of fucking times it just erases my existence?   I just cannot have fun on here. Even as a team anymore. With the SBMM and EOMM, I get punished immediately if I do slightly good in a match, by being thrown in matches with people that just shit on me the entire time.  People complain that movement is slow and terrible, but it's not. If it was, then explain why sliding and shooting around corners, or jumping and shooting is the strategy. Movement is still super fast and fucking stupid just like before. Shields and knives are near impossible to counter. Their feet are covered, can't flank because they will rush and kill you. Can't throw because they will counter throw faster somehow or just rush and kill you. Thanks. All I want is to jump into matches and have fun. No, not just stomp everyone, that's not fun. I want to have fun. I want varied lobbies, showing that people aren't just bots. It doesn't help that the aim assist actually tracks for you, with no limitations on distance or if there are particle effects in the way or not. If your aim starts to move on it's own, you just aim and fire and you're gonna get the kill. I position myself better and shoot first? Doesn't matter. Enemy moves around, causing me to have to MANUALLY track them with my mouse and eyes, while controlling recoil with particle effects and camera shake. While they can just slightly tilt R stick down and fire. Flinch? Damn right that I do but when you have aim assist, the tracking pretty much counters it. There's nothing fun about it. I am only playing it for fear of missing out, and since I already bought the damn thing. The campaign was fun but that alone isn't worth what I paid. I am not ok, and this game is making shit worse. It is infuriating, by design. I can't even get good games anymore. What is the new ""good"" for me is if I am close to breaking even. Before I could maybe 1 in 10 rounds get one where I actually do good. Now it's just getting wrecked at spawn, or instant snap turned from someone who heard me moving across the map and has UAV that works through Ghost.

174390067,english,0,1938090,"This launcher is absolutely terrible, utterly annoying, an insurmountable pain in the ass. In order to play the BO6 open beta I had to do the following: - Download the BO6 open beta, which also downloaded MW2 mp, which I own; - Open the Call of Duty launcher; - Restart the launcher because of an update, after which it started crashing; - After a few tries, I managed to start the launcher once again, after which it required another restart; - Finally I managed to arrive in the interface where I could select Black Ops 6 Open Beta, which I did; - The Call of Duty launcher closed and BO6 started loading; - After BO6 loaded, it required another restart because of an update; - After the restart, I got an error regarding the loading of player stats, which forced me to quit to desktop.  How the hell is this possible?  Even if I somehow manage to play this godforsaken demo, why would I buy this abomination if I have to go through such a hassle in order to play it?  I will probably uninstall MW2, perhaps this will help, because otherwise I have to go through almost the same process once again.  Edit: So I managed to play it and other that the occasional typical sweaty hyperactive players, it is quite enjoyable. However, I would still not recommend it. After every update it still requires you to restart the game after opening the CoD launcher and selecting BO6 which closes the CoD launcher and opens BO6. It's stupid that they did not change this since MW1 reboot. At least make it check for the update and restart it faster, perhaps upon opening the launcher, not after 1 minute wasted in the loading screens."

The campaign is a lot of fun with some great missions and overall better character development than the original MW2. 4. The multiplayer, WHEN BALANCED, is a lot of fun to play HOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with this game. 1. Breaking up lobbies to readjust for SBMM not only penalizes the player for playing well, it also doesn't give a chance for people to build rivalries or community with other players like in older CODs. 2. The aim assist on the controller is mind numbing. The fact that I switched to a controller and am overall playing better is a bad sign. 3. The main menu/UI in this game has to be the worst I have ever seen. 4. Weapon balancing is desperately needed.

149713623,english,1,1938090,"Nvm game wanna learn how to make atom bomb? First, a PhD level of training in metallurgy to determine all of the different metals and alloys needed to fabricate the parts of the bomb. PhD level training in nuclear physics to determine exactly what isotopes and how much will be needed and, of course, exactly in what shape they will be needed. A PhD level of training in explosives to determine what type and how much explosive will be needed for the various non-nuclear parts of the bomb. A Tool and Die level of expertise as a machinist to fabricate the parts correctly for the bomb. So far all of these areas of expertise are readily available. A couple of lifetimes of study will get you there. Naturally, you will also need a (very) nice machine shop to fabricate your device.  Now comes the more difficult part: getting fissile material. This type of material is usually available only from nation states. I have checked at Walmart, and they didn’t seem to stock it, so buying enough is going to be a problem. A big problem. A very big problem. In fact, an insurmountable problem. Fissile material is MUCH better protected than gold, and many times more expensive. So, even if you can overcome the various expertise requirements, you will have a very, very big problem getting the fissile material. However, that is just one of many problems I will leave to the ambitious bomb maker to solve.  Were you to decide to make your own fissile material, you would need to decide whether to use U235 or Pu239. In either case, you will need many tons of uranium metal, a purchase of which may draw the attention of various 3 letter agencies. This will be a fundamental decision since they are made in completely different ways. The U235 route will require thousands of ultra-centrifuges with a HUGE power plant to run them, while the Pu239 will require a nuclear reactor. Both will require very large laboratories for the industrial separation of the different highly radioactive isotopes. Just a couple more problems for the inveterate bomb maker to solve.  It might also be noted that were you to somehow manage to acquire said fissile material, there would be quite a number of agencies interested in how you got it, where it is, and just what you were planning to do with it. The FBI, CIA, MI5, KGB (or whatever their current name is) Mossad, and a few others come to mind. These tend to be (very) unfriendly and also very curious. Their methods of getting answers may not be pleasant, but since you will probably never be seen again after their visit, I would consider that aspect your personal problem, and, again, one for you to solve in due course.  So, there are a few challenges to making your own home made atomic bomb. However, with enough determination and money, you might succeed. I don’t recommend you try this at home, though. And don’t forget your neighbors won’t appreciate your testing it, either."

177481296,english,1,1938090,"This game is intended solely for the most resolute individuals, those who perhaps grapple with certain inner afflictions. It is teeming with various groups of challengers: there are the relentless ""sweats,"" forever straining to outdo one another; the so-called ""movement demons,"" whose every action seems designed to bewilder and outmaneuver; and, of course, the perennial campers, who seem to find joy in hiding within a building for the entire match, only to claim victory with a paltry two team eliminations (a strategy which, I must confess, I utterly despise).  However, beyond these troublesome opponents, one of the most lamentable and regressive issues within the game is the overly harsh toxicity filter, with penalties that are grossly disproportionate to the offense. What we seek is a space where we may express our frustrations freely—where we can curse our enemies with full force, so as to avoid destroying our own equipment in sheer frustration. Yet, Activision has decided to sanitize the community to such a degree that genuine in-game communication has nearly vanished, save for the occasional child whose voice emerges amidst the clamor of their parents' quarrels in the background.  Moreover, Activision, I feel assured that I speak on behalf of the entire original community—the veteran players who have consistently spent their hard-earned money on a game that, in truth, changes but little with each passing year, overseen by certain spoiled and aging executives (whose indulgent misdeeds have been laid bare through well-known leaks). We categorically reject the imposition of a voice chat filter that, after a single warning, silences players—barring communication for weeks, months, or even indefinitely. We do not pay for a service merely to have our freedoms so unjustly curtailed.  I did not intend to offend the team or any individual, but my patience is wearing thin.

I believe negative reviews are coming from cod haters of players who havn’t adjusted yet, but from someone who has played every call of duty since beginning this one brings in great game play, a refresh with a unique vibe, and some of the best performance and memory utilization yet especially on PC. Bravo! This one will catch on soon once people adjust and i see reviews rising steadily."
175383647,english,0,1938090,"i played about 100 hours between MW2 and MW3, both games sucked and I was excited for Black Ops 6. I played the early access beta after doing the Vault Edition upgrade on Xbox Game Pass. About 3 hours in I switched to my Xbox and was greeted with ""your account has been permanently banned due to manipulation of game data"". I have never cheated in my 19 years of playing Call of Duty. I appealed the ban and it was denied twice. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and filed a complaint with Activision. They denied my claim and said they have evidence that I cheated but cannot show me what it is. I requested refunds from Steam and Xbox for all Call of Duty titles as my account is banned across games and platforms, and was denied a refund. My steam account is labeled as a cheater and I've lost all hope. Will not be supporting this company anymore. Bunch of thieves."
171971086,english,0,1938090,"Imagine paying out 70 dollars and still being treated as if you're playing a F2P game, yep that's the current state of the Call of Duty series. I admit the gunplay is excellent and engaging, but after investing over 200 hours each in MWII (2022) and MWIII (2023), the gameplay hasn't justified the time and money spent. There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.  [b]TLDR; invest your money and time in a different game instead of this slop and cashgrab[/b]"
129131029,english,0,1938090,"[h1] Not worth it. At all. [/h1]  Ever since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You're simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.  Skill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I'm playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it's the same scenario since the game got released.   Also, if there is a ""ranked"" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn't the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?  Extra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I'm getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?  For some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don't know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can't emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can't bother calling it aim assist anymore, it's Aimbot. For real it's aimbot. You'll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you're slightly next to their crosshair, you're done. They don't even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there's no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.  I get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they're using just their thumbs to aim, but I don't want to be a part of this. I don't want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he'll be able to get kills. It's simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it's not possible? Isn't the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & Battle.net combo?  Some TL:DR for you: [b]Pros:[/b] - Good Gunplay - Good Animations - Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons - Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock - AMD's FSR works pretty well  [b]Cons:[/b] - SBMM - No Crossplay opt-out choice - Inconsistent footsteps & audio - No Stopping Power as a perk - No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk - Matches feel rigged  *Edit 18/08/2024*  So after many extra hours and upon reaching max level, the more time I spent playing this, the more it reinforced what I and many others have already said before.  To sum it up, I'll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience I've had with this game this one year and a half:   Me and one of my friends are playing Prisoner Rescue for a two hour session in the night. First hour goes fine, we're both making good scores and we have a 7 game win-streak, we're seeing some new players and some old, matches play fine with no problem, nothing out of the ordinary happening.   Now the second hour we're playing, we're starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game. We're getting teammates that are acting like they're playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives, while the enemy team is either a 4 stack, a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend. It's a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over.   Our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual, hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend, enemy weapons get such a fast TTK it feels like a single-frame death, meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone. I was using G3A3 and my friend was using SCAR-H, and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a Battle-Rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range. Also packet loss (white color) and packet burst (orange color) was appearing every few seconds for both of us, but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session. And of course let's not forget, the enemies we're fighting have below 10 ping, meanwhile my friend is at 40 and I'm at 60.  The game's algorithm is literally nerfing you in real time, sacrificing your experience in order to make the opponent's better. It's trying really hard to keep you as close to 1 K/D and 1 W/L as possible, with whatever means it has available. Activision is known to take the fun out of their games the moment you show them you're above average and can actually play good.  People who defend this and act as if me or my friend are the problem, they're the same people getting gaslighted by the same algorithm they protect, because they're so garbage they end up playing on protected brackets of matchmaking in order to spend more money for skins.  If you still think this franchise has a chance for redemption, you are another fool of consumerism and you deserve every ultra-low quality products you're getting from these companies."

179903325,english,1,1097150,"I’ve been playing Fall Guys since its launch in August 2020, and I’ve seen the game evolve from having a lot of potential to becoming somewhat stagnant over time. Recently, I achieved 100% completion, which was both fun and agonizing, and it gave me a deeper understanding of the game, leading me to write this review.  To start, Fall Guys is a fun and entertaining game. I enjoy playing solo or with friends, although it’s definitely more enjoyable with a group. That said, the game can get repetitive during longer sessions; it’s best played in bursts of one to three hours.  Most levels are fun, interesting, and sometimes challenging, while others can be rather boring. A recent addition I love is the ability to carry teammates (literally), which is both cute and helpful, especially since it lets me carry my girlfriend during matches. The developers have also introduced the functionality to create, host, and play custom games, which has been a highly requested feature. This addition is perfect for warming up or practicing specific levels if you’re aiming to improve. Furthermore, the frequent rotation of game modes keeps things fresh by introducing new levels regularly.  Now, for some broader points about the game, which aren’t entirely related to the gameplay experience but are worth mentioning.  In March 2021, Fall Guys developer Mediatonic was acquired by Epic Games, and in my opinion, this was a turning point that led to a stagnation in its development.  Previously, you could earn cosmetics no matter their rarity just by playing the game. Winning a match rewarded you with Crowns, which could then be used to purchase cooler costumes. I personally got a lot of great skins this way. However, the current system no longer allows you to buy anything meaningful without spending real money. Microtransactions have been heavily injected into the game, making it far less rewarding to win a match. Now, the only incentive for winning is bragging rights (yay, I came first… 🤦‍♂️).  This shift is typical for any game acquired by Epic. They’re doing the same thing to Rocket League, and it’s disappointing to see. Sure, making the game free-to-play (F2P) brought in a massive player base, but for players who want to invest more time, there’s little incentive to keep going.  All in all, Fall Guys is still a fun game, and I do recommend it. However, it does become repetitive and boring after a while, something the developers could work to avoid. Unfortunately, I doubt Epic Games will prioritize this, as their focus seems to be on monetizing the IP they’ve invested in. It’s not just about making money—it feels like they want all the money."
164849381,english,0,1097150,"The latest Update (Fall Forever Update) is severely dissapointing and basically leaves the game a shell of its former self. Player reduction( 30 players start a show), round reduction (always 3 rounds) and the physics changes ruin just about anything that made Fall Guys a fun game.  This update is clearly aimed at making Fall Guys a mobile game while not shying away from alienating a strong   coreplayerbase that stuck with the game through years  of very barebones content (if at all).   ""We see the best version of Fall Guys as where you press go and there are 100 variations of that first level."" Joe Walsh (Fall Guys Crreative Director), 2020  Clearly nothing of that ethos is remaining. Best of luck in your pursuit of porting this new version of the game to mobile but considering your trackrecord you'll screw that up too."

Recently, the game is utter garbage - why is there only 17 maps out of 82 in rotation? Why has the jump mechanic changed? Why is there no incentive to play when you can simply purchase skins with money?  The heart has been ripped out of one of my most favorite games :("

Without remorse or pity they have slowly chipped away the reasons to keep playing. Simpler smaller levels. Fewer and fewer players in lobbies. No new maps.   How in the hell could they have squandered such a popular game? DONT VAULT MAPS. MAKE MORE. Stupidity ruined this. I only hope someone else can learn from their mistakes."

What truly makes Fall Guys shine is how it embraces chaotic, whimsical fun at every turn. The simple controls and unpredictable physics create endless opportunities for hilarity, with each round feeling like an over-the-top game of chance and skill. One moment, you’re confidently running toward the finish line, and the next, you’re sent flying off the course by a swinging hammer or trampled by a herd of other players. This chaotic energy is what makes every match feel fresh and exciting, and it’s impossible to predict what will happen next. The vibrant costumes and goofy character designs only add to the whimsy, letting players express themselves in the most ridiculous ways possible. And with the constant seasonal updates, there's always something new to explore, from bizarre themed levels to even wackier outfits. While losing can be frustrating, the chaotic fun is so infectious that you’ll be diving back into the madness over and over again. Fall Guys is a celebration of unpredictable, chaotic, whimsical fun, making it a perfect pick for anyone looking for lighthearted competition and a good laugh!"

I mostly played duo's was fun and challenging, so many maps to play and around 5 rounds. Finding a game was never an issue, it was 60 players, then 40, neither an issue to join a game, but now 32 players.  This means only 3 rounds per game.  Might not sound like much? but trust me it is.  On top of this, the original map list as been cut by around 75% i believe. Killer for me to think as when an old school map came on it was like a good feeling and hype to play.  Now rounds are stuffed with community maps that look like a 5 year old as made.  Gutted is my biggest feeling about this game,  guaranteed not tons and tons of hours but the hours played was a fun time."

168878519,english,0,1097150,"Fall Guys is pretty infuriating, not because of all my last second golden crown misses, but because of the frustratingly abundant wasted potential this game has had since its release. There are few instances where I personally feel like I could do a better job than the actual developers, but this is one of those exceptional cases. The sheer lack of content this game has, is incomprehensible to me. Level concepts for Fall Guys are so simple and easy to make that it’s hard to grasp how slow-paced and creatively minimal many of its updates have been. After months of waiting, most they could come up with are derivative reiterations of existing levels. Selling their soul to Epic Games has sucked almost all the enjoyment out of the progression system, but the final nail in the coffin has been giving free reign to players to conceive their very own levels. This absolutely exposes the blatant limitations behind the vision and work ethic of Mediatonic that have been poisoning this fun game that could have been so much more than what it is right now."
185533034,english,1,1097150,"I remember having a lot of fun with Fall Guys in 2020 when it was popular and again when they made it free to play. When I decided to play a few dozen games recently, I didn't find the game to be in as bad of a state as some reviews made it seem. All my lobbies filled up in a few seconds and were fairly easy. My win rate was probably 30% or 40%, so they weren't incredibly difficult. The monetization is definitely too much. They treat the shop like Fortnite (probably because they're owned by Epic Games) but buying stuff doesn't feel nearly as satisfying. The Epic Games integration is a little annoying. I tried playing with a friend who didn't have an Epic Games account, and I wasn't able to invite him. Fall guys isn't available on Steam anymore, but it's available on the Epic Games Store for free. It's no perfect game, but it's fun every once in awhile with friends or if you want to turn your brain off for a bit."

173116684,english,0,1097150,"Oh, how the mighty (guys) have fallen.  This live service that takes inspiration from popular TV shows such as Takeshi's castle, or in some regions like mine, Supermatch, was quite the sensation back when it came out. It got such an uproar that the servers couldn't handle that many people playing at the same time. It presented a casual way to get through different obstacle courses, customize your bean person and have a chance at winning the precious crown. With this in mind, the studio set a price tag and with it expectations of seasons with new modes, stages, items, community levels and so on. So what happened?  It seems that after many years the direction of the game changed for the worse. In-game currency came at a harder cost making it more of a hassle to purchase even common items in the store unless you pay up with actual money. Furthermore, the user-made levels started to get into the singleplayer rotation, taking out other beloved stages and, as they were always the same ones, they got old quite fast. Connection errors started getting more and more frequent, ruining some casual plays and streams with friends or making me wait for an indefinite amount of time in the queue. Oh, and of course, some levels simply never showed up again, specifically ones demanded for a couple of Steam achievements, and if they did I just had to keep trying to get them again, probably screwing with other people in the process (low baller, I'm talking about you specifically).  With that being said, I get that some of these issues have been brought up in the subreddit and if you don't mind playing it once in a while with good internet (like a couple of times every season) this is a fine enough game. But I was among the ones who paid for the game back when it wasn't free to play and listed in this store so I expected something else. It's quite upsetting but it is what it is."

It can be so chaotic especially when you're getting pulled by everyone in the lobby, whilst at the same time being funny especially when you're with friends and you all get eliminated in the funniest ways. It's lighthearted but can also be competitive at times when you are just 2 cm away from qualifying, it has an overall good combination with different modes to play, the skins are okay. One annoying thing is that there is no chat option in game, hope they add that in the future to make it easier for friends with no mics. In addition to this, the camera angle is so annoying you cant look up towards to the sky which is a pain especially in modes like FallBall, hope they change this in the future too"

190826201,english,1,1097150,"What is ""Entry Fragging""? Entry Fragging is where a player trys to get an entry pick (kill) to open up a bombsite for the team to play a strategy or take the site. It's used in every single pro team and is one of the vital roles for a player to have.  Entry Fraggers are usually players with very good invididual skill and people that are confident, not afraid to get deep in the mud and take out some players.  If you're new to this game, and you play with your friends on matchmaking, having a designated entry fragger will win you the game! They will help you open up lots of different strategies to execute in the round. Improving your individual skill Now, if you're going to be an entry fragger then you have to be good at shooting people in the face without them shootin' you! What a lot of entry fraggers will tend to do is try as hard as they can to pick off a player or get them in a tricky situation where a trade is avaliable, just remember that if you get killed, it's alright if your team trades- you've done your job.  So to improve your individual skill you'll want to be playing a lot of deathmatch and aim maps, these will help you learn how to shoot your gun and give you a lot of muscle memory, something that you'll need when getting an entry frag. I advise finding a HS only server to play on, and then keep on playing on it before going into a game, this will help you get used to aiming at the head, which with an AK-47 is a 1-hit kill to the head.  If HS-only mode is too difficult for you, then just stick to playing aim maps and regular deathmatch, to practice your sprays and just get a feel for the gun and how it works, HS-only mode is only going to work if you know how to burst fire, spraying randomly wont do anything unless you're GeT_RighT :) Keeping confident You'll never be able to get the kill if you don't believe in yourself! You know that you have the skill to take out that player, and you want to take him out for your team, you need to stay focused and on-point.. you need to stay confident in your skill to pick a head!  If you are always shaking and twitch when going in for the entry frag, one thing which I find very helpful to keep calm and confident, is to take my pinkie fingers and keep touching my thumbs with them.. it really soothes you :)  Playing slow in CS won't work all the time, playing passive will only lead to you running out of time and being in a tricky situation where you can't make a play in time.. so you need to pretend that you're indestructable and get your hands dirty! Convince yourself that no one can kill you.. you're god! Prefire spots and crosshair placement As an entry-fragger, you need to be able to kill players without them even knowing where the hell they were shot from, so you need to prepare yourself to take out players where they're likely to be, there are lots of good tutorials for this on YouTube, and If you're a noob to CS then I wouldn't advise trying to pick up this skill straight away, as it is a very advanced technique for experienced players. But alas, if you can master it early on then you're gonna sky-rocket through those matchmaking ranks!  And as for your crosshair placement, you'll always want to have your crosshair aiming at the head level, so that as soon as you spot a player or prefire them, it will be an instant headshot, and instant kill. This also means that you need to be pre-aiming spots where players are likely to be, this links with pre-shooting lots. After lots of time playing, you'll eventually pickup where the spots will be- except through walls! So you can keep your crosshair aimed at a spot through a wall and then go on to pre-fire.      Pistols and landing vital shots Pistols are a very weird subject for entry-fragging, but in a pistol round it'll be vital that you get an entry frag to take a site- as pistol round is possibly the most important round of the game!  One issue with pistols is how random they can be, being a semi-automatic weapon (excluding the CZ-75) and this will really affect how well you entry frag. One thing that isn't random about the pistols, is that most pistols will have an extremely accurate first shot while running, but after that they will go all over the place. This means that you can run past a spot and shoot someone in the head without them even knowing what hit them! This all links in with pre-shooting of course.  Spamming with pistols is basically pointless, the accuracy will decrease so much, and you won't be able to get a headshot on pistol round, and that's all it takes for a kill. You always want to be tapping the pistols close to the enemies head, and keep it on their head! A lot of players will shoot their pistols very far away from the head and eventually resort to lucky body-shot kills. THIS IS NOT OK! Body shots are not what the want unless you know the player is lit as f***!  The WarOwl is a very good player and YouTuber, he has lots of tutorials on how to play the game and improve your game, I use his videos in this guide a lot- as they are very helpful!   You're all ready! As a new player, you've learnt just about everything that you'll need to get into entry fragging and raise your rank in matchmaking! I hope that this guide has helped you new players lots, and that you can continue to enjoy the game and demolish other players!"

185568687,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys is honestly just a really great game to play with friends. I really enjoy the physics and most mini-games are fun. I don't usually play by myself, but that can also be enjoyable! I'd say the part of the game that shines the most however, is actually the music. It kinda feels like they got someone from the SiivaGunner team to compose an entire game's soundtrack.  As for any issues, I have three main ones: Starting out small, some of the mini-games are honestly just not that good. Most of the time, it's fine since they don't really show up in the queue, but if you get a game that's just bad mini-game after bad mini-game, it sucks pretty bad. The next issue I wanna mention is that there's a lot of time between each section of gameplay. First, you have to wait until everyone else is done with the mini-game (sometimes the timer ends up running out first, which takes even LONGER). Next, you have to watch everyone who lost get kicked out. After that, you have to wait until it picks a mini-game (which can take a while). Lastly, you have to wait until the ""How to Play"" section is over with. It's actually not that big of an issue if you have friends in call since you can usually just talk about the mini-game you just played or spectate your friends that are still playing. The biggest complaint I have however is the fact that you can't play all of the mini-games at any point with the discovery menu (or with some other solution). It'd be really cool to be able to just play some of the better maps on their own.  Even though most of this review was spent criticizing the game, I'd probably rate Fall Guys in its current state an 8/10, would definitely recommend it.

119268215,english,0,1097150,"Epic Games had to ruin everything. Removed the game from Steam, made it free and added microtransactions. Players that bought the game received awful rewards for buying it after it got free to play, and all the crowns we earned were turned into Kudos, a currency that is now obsolete because Epic created their own currency, the Show Bucks. Now most of the items use this new coin that players can only get by spending money, making the game less fun to play. In the past Players could get most skins if they were skilled enough for free, but now 80% of the good skins need to be paid with an exaggerated price, these skins are way to expensive for what they are worth especially considering they were obtainable with the old currency of the game that was free and could be earned by just playing it. It is so ironic that players that pre-ordered the game received a Gordon Freeman skin, a character made by Valve the creator of Steam, for the game now leaving Steam and join Rocket League on one of the worst Gaming Companies possible. I really feel betrayed with the decisions of the game devs because I always supported the game even in awful situations like the cheating problem, now to see everything *fall* apart, very sad to know that money can change anyone and make the worst mistakes ever. Last but not least I don't understand how people could accept this situation, why should these type of decisions should be accepted nowadays, if something like this happened in 2012 people would riot for a change, but nowadays it is something normal that people are used to, sadly. This may be the biggest reason why I prefer old games, no lazy unfinished products at day 1, no microtransactions, just a simple good game with good unlockables FOR FREE. Gaming companies are greedy and will want more, and in the future things will be way worse. We really shouldn't accept these actions, but sadly I guess we're too late. I miss the old days when everything was simple."

75082098,english,1,1097150,"Here's what I see in this game: potential. Is it the best designed game out there? No. Is it the best multiplayer game out there? No. Is it the best optimized game out there (at least at the time of writing)? No. But what it does have is an amazing base game that's incredibly addicting. Even for the $20 its selling for, which in my opinion is a bit high, it's still a fantastic game that is incredibly fun to play with a group of friends.  Obviously there's a lot missing here: private multiplayer, custom matches, the lack of maps, actually being able to use your own name (lol), and the crackdown on cheating (to be completely fair I haven't encountered any). If you're skeptical about the game, I wouldn't blame you for waiting for it to go on sale or waiting until more content is added. We've seen this song and dance before: games release with a bare bones experience that's wildly fun, but gets old fast. That being said, I hope the developers continue to make this game better and better. Cut them some slack too, they got flooded with a player base they couldn't have expected. Let them get back on their feet after the floodgates opened, and show us what they can do.  Please keep going devs, I'm having a ton of fun so far but it's got a bit of a ways before it's really amazing. 8/10."
98256210,english,1,1097150,Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.  It's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!
74696182,english,1,1097150,"The Devolverland Expo led me to Fall Guys.  I was a little reluctant to get involved in a Battle Royale style game as I generally suck at competitive play but the sheer gleeful hilarity of this game more than makes up for the frustrations.  Are there server issues?  Sure.  Are there filthy filthy cheaters?  Oh you know it!  Am I still terrible?  Hoo boy am I ever.  Is it filled with bright colours, upbeat music, snappy mini games and lovable characters all bumbling their way to victory or slime?   Yes, yes it is and I love it.   +++UPDATE+++  So now I've played for, gee forty hours, seriously?  In that time I have managed to win two episodes.  Bear in mind I am terrible.  Two victories out of hundreds of failures.  Sweet sweet victories.  This sounds like a pretty bad ratio but really each victory feels truly momentous especially considering the ever increasing number of cheating hackers.  The cheating was something I could overlook when it was rare, but now it is the norm and it is really making me lose interest.  This is supposed to be Fall Guys, NOT Fly Guys.  There is very little competitive edge when you know the dude who is hovering above the level is going to automatically win!  I am now at the grinding stage just trying to collect the rest of the cosmetics for the season.    The initial shine has definitely dulled, and unless Mediatonic add some kind of anti cheat, this is going to quickly lose the large casual audience.  We shall see what Season 2 brings, but if the hackers are going to be allowed to continue operating I don't see myself joining the ranks of hopeful suckers never able to get a legitimate win.   ===UP-UPDATE===  So now I'm deeper than sixty hours in and Mediatonic have indeed listened to the criticisms levelled at their tiny little behemoth of a game.  There is now an anti cheat running in the background, which I know has been a bone of contention in some other releases (hello DOOM: Eternal) but it was desperately needed here and to be fair, I haven't happened upon any filthy dirty hackers since.  So now I can get back to being terrible through my own volition.  There has also been a refreshing of the levels.  A remixing of sorts.  The old tried and tested games have been given a lick of fresh paint and are all just a little bit different.  Clockwise rotating beams now might rotate anti-clockwise.  Wrecking balls that swung along the x axis now might swing along the y axis.  And there are random spinning hammers all over the shop.  It has definitely breathed fresh life into the game and really all my previous complaints have now been addressed.  Jolly well played there chaps.  Good form indeed.  Right, I'm off back to my glorious upbeat technicolour failure..."
117568023,english,0,1097150,"Once again, Epic Games sticks their greedy fingers into anything they can get their hands on. Their recent overhaul monetizes the hell out of the game, and they've screwed over long time players.  1. You're no longer able to get rare skins through playing the game alone, you now have to pay. The free currency (that was already a decent grind to get) can only be used to buy common stuff now.  2. Previously, crowns were typically used to purchase rare skins. They were only obtained through high placement, or very slowly through leveling. Now that crowns have been removed, there is far less incentive to actually grind and get good at the game.  3. Skins that used to be event exclusive are now being sold in the shop, which is unfair for anyone who had them.  4. Old legendary color skins are now common/rare, which is also unfair for those who had them.  It's been a good run, but I'm through with this game. There's literally nothing to play for anymore. I cant even finish the last achievement on my steam list without forking out cash, even though I ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME.  I hated Epic Games with a passion before this, and somehow they continue to find ways to remind me to keep hating them."

How can they remove it off the steam store, take away the crowns we earned added micro transaction instead of just earning the skins through playing. I remember when I could feel a sense of achievement by winning. stacking my crowns to buy skins.  None of this is the case now. It's just a corporate shell of a game which once had integrity.   I will never forget the betrayal"
148095686,english,0,1097150,"""Fall Guys is a free, cross-platform massively multiplayer party royale game"" ""Fall Guys is no longer available on the Steam Store""  Epic Games bought out Fall Guys and immediately pulled it from Steam because they didn't like that they had to give a cut of the profits to Steam. Then they made a PAID GAME into a free to play game, modifying the cosmetic shop so you can buy the cosmetics with real money (which degrades the value of the cosmetics, seeing as they were originally earned with crowns) and adding a battlepass with a premium track.  The game has since been going downhill. I really must wonder at what point developers will learn to not let Epic Games buy them out, and I'm also wondering when people will stop giving money to a corporation that clearly hates them.  Thanks Epic Games, for ruining another good game."

98963553,english,1,1097150,"I've spent a ton of time playing this game, so I want to do my best to give an honest review of the game and do it justice.  A basic explanation on what the game is, would be a colorful and eye-popping battle royal style game that includes a multitude of different rounds to play - including solo race rounds, puzzle rounds, and skill based rounds. Team rounds are also a staple of the game play, pairing you up with random players in your lobby to work towards a common goal. However, there is only one crown, and therefore can only be one winner! In some cases there can be multiple winners, but for this to happen you have to have cooperation with the rest of the lobby and some skill in order to time out rounds.  The game play feels choppy at times, is the best way I can describe it. The crowd physics in the game, regarding interacting with other players through running into their character or grabbing them for different purposes, has from day one been an ongoing issue. While some games you can play with no issues and great server connection, other games will have you frustrated, especially in game modes requiring the grabbing aspect to either steal tails, hold Pegwins or trying to fight back against someone trying to grief you. I feel like it'll forever be an issue in the game, because the problem seems to be much deeper than just a simple patch can fix. I understand that this issue can be a deal breaker for new players, and I want to reiterate that it will become a problem for every player at some point.  For a game that looks colorful and fun and simple to play, there is a strong competitive player base that makes the games much more difficult for unsuspecting players. There are some people who will be able to pick up the game quickly and roll with the punches, but for most players there is a learning curve involved. I'm currently, as of this review, still under 600 crowns in total with 900 hours of playtime. I personally enjoy playing the game with friends, however, and spend a lot of time in game modes such as Squads Show and 2-3 man squads. This isn't a game that I think you can solely play competitively, and if you're going to continue coming back to the game you should find a way to have fun while playing! That can be any reason - grief other players, play with friends, or helping other players win. There's an amazing scene of streamers and players on Twitch that really got me hooked on the game, and I encourage anyone looking for other players to check out someone they like on that site! Personally I recommend DjBigRuss and CrazyyTrainn, but there are plenty of people to chat and play with!  Overall, it's a game - there will be plenty of people who enjoy it, and many others who dislike it. There's plenty of players online however, and finding a match doesn't take very long at all. With all the different levels and variations of those levels, along with an interactive media team and a development team that brings new content to the game as soon as they can. I recommend giving the game a chance at some point, if you're not willing to spend $20 for it then wait until it goes on sale. It's a wonderful game and I've met some wonderful people I don't think I would have met without this game, and it'll forever be a game that I have a ton of love for."

73778456,english,0,1097150,"Update 9.19.20 || The devs have addressed the cheating issue and have finally added EAC, which has helped to alleviate the cheating problem. I'm still going to leave this review as it was at the time that I wrote it to stand as testament to how terrible this game was on release.   I still don't recommend this game. I have zero faith in these developers. The anticheat took far longer than it should have to be added and all the other issues with this game still remain unaddressed.   PS, usernames are STILL disabled. I'm pretty confident the developers have no intention of re-enabling them. RIP grabbing ttv streamers, it was the only truly fun thing to do in this game.   //  This game's launch has been an absolute trainwreck.  THE GAME RUNS ENTIRELY CLIENT-SIDE, which means people can blatantly speedhack with no special hack tools. The game also has NO ANTI-CHEAT, AT ALL. The closest thing to anti-cheat is a single text channel in the game's official Discord where you can manually report cheaters, which, surprise, doesn't actually get any cheaters banned.   Users were able to use HTML in their Steam username to make their names appear large or colorful in-game. I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to ""Fall Guy ####"". WHY NOT JUST FIX THE HTML IN USER'S NAMES. Let me give your programmers a hint, it's called input sanitization, you can look up a tutorial for it on YouTube and actually do your job.  So with those two problems coupled together, yeah let me just go and file a report against someone with nothing but the username ""Fall Guy 1234"" to go on—I can't even track their Steam account through recent games. Keep in mind also that this game has a million-some players and there are only 4 digits in each randomized name, so there are going to be several dozen duplicates of each numerical name. The devs couldn't track that to a player even if they wanted to, so no one is getting banned for cheating. Great work guys. It's only going to get worse as the game goes on if nothing gets fixed.   This game has the worst netcode of any game I've ever played. There's a gamemode that involves running around the map and stealing tails from other players. This minigame was copy-pasted twice to make three equally garbage modes, I've heard dozens of complains against them from friends and streamers and I don't think a single person actually enjoys playing them. Enemies with Walmart parking lot tier internet can grab you from over 10 feet away and when you attempt to grab the tail off an enemy you can see the grab icon pop up on their character and nothing happens 50% of the time. It's so inconsistent that there's almost no skill here, just pure luck.   Nobody enjoys the forced team gamemodes either. You only have a small amount of control to the outcome of team games, so winning equates to a simple game of luck based on how bad your teammates are. In addition to that, this is a physics-based game, using Unity's default physics engine. It's horrifically inconsistent and sometimes your character will simply trip over their own feet, falling down and losing the game because someone grabs your tail while you're on the floor, or you jump down a level on Hex-a-gone and your character simply trips for no reason and you fall to your death while you try to stand up. The physics make the game feel horrible to play. Half of the minigames feel like they were quickly thrown together in the last 2 weeks of development to meet quota. Especially ""Perfect Match"", the game where no one ever dies unless they're literally afk.   Only *one day* after releasing, the game's servers completely died, for absolutely everyone, for almost an entire day. They had previously been dropping constantly in the middle of games. The devs' had presumably been attempting to migrate their servers to a different host with a larger capacity, but apparently failed to do so and were being very secretive as to why. They had announced a maintenance would begin at 6:00 am, but randomly decided to begin six hours early at peak player count time and gave no ETA for when it would be finished. The ""maintenance"" ended up taking almost the entire day and no one could play the game the entire time. When the game first officially released they deliberately avoided announcing the time that the game would unlock. They also avoided notifying players when the servers were back online after the ""maintanance"". They clearly knew the servers would choke on the first day and didn't fix the servers in the three day period before the game launched, or, you know, several months before, they had ample reason to predict this would be a problem but did nothing.    My favorite part of it all is that the developers are BLAMING THE PLAYERS for their problems. On Twitter they blamed the players when the servers went over capacity, clearly their fault, and they blamed the players when users used html in their names, also clearly their own fault. Fix your game.   The game has a separate Twitter account for the server status. Not only has the account constantly lied about the status of the servers, in addition to claiming they ""would tweet when the servers are back online"" and then didn't, I thought it was pretty hilarious that the main Twitter playfully posted something along the lines of ""Look how many people are following our server account!"". Yeah, no, they're not following that because they want to hear your awful hello-fellow-kids tweets, they're doing it because they want to know when the servers are going to be back online for the game they all paid $20 for.    The devs had MONTHS to beta test this game and somehow bafflingly didn't catch on to the fact that the servers wouldn't have enough capacity to handle the amount of players on launch. Or fix the broken netcode. Or add anticheat. Or fix html in usernames. Or rework the bad minigames. I refuse to believe this kind of stuff wasn't caught in QA, which means either there was no QA, or the devs just ignored the feedback.    I've never seen a company shoot themselves in the foot and handle success so poorly.  And to the people claiming that this is excusable because ""they're just a small indie company"", it isn't, because they're not. They have 230 employees and have existed since 2005. This is pure incompetence. I don't see this game lasting past its first season."
80884289,english,1,1097150,"I've had Fall Guys for a while now, and while the game now is merely a shadow of what it once was during it's first month of release, that doesn't take away from the fact that Fall Guys is a really great game to kill some time or play with friends. The gameplay is fun yet slightly challenging and the different courses are very reminiscent of those TV shows I used to watch as a kid. That said though there are a limited number of courses you can play through and though fun for a while they get old very fast, after about 2 hours I had seen every course in the game and after playing the same courses over and over again, sometimes back to back, it started to become a drag. All in all though I still recommend Fall Guys for when you have a few spare hours to burn or for when you're with your friends and wanna get a quick laugh."

78158202,english,0,1097150,"Fall Guys, as a concept, is a wondrous spin on the battle royale genre we’ve seen in recent years. My woes, however, stem from what I’m assuming is a dev team that’s trying their best with a playerbase they never expected.   Let me preface by saying that I am absolutely in love with this game, it’s probably one of my most favorites to come out in recent years. Solo matches are what I do to turn off my brain and relax for a bit. Playing with friends can lead to many laughs and wholehearted fun- but... only when it works. This is where my first problem stems:   Matchmaking into a game when queued with others on my friends list can be super dodgy. We get matched into different games from each other entirely, some of us just drop out of our team in the menu completely out of left field, or there will be a hard disconnect while we’re playing in an ongoing match. I do note, however, the disconnection issues have gotten better since one of their season 2 patches, so I thank them for that.  Another lingering issue I have is that ever since the mid-season update during the first season, one of my friends has been falsely flagged for cheating ever since EAC has been implemented. He has exhausted every option to get a concrete answer as to why they’ve been banned since then, only to be told that they -won’t- reverse it and won’t even tell him why he was banned in the first place. I KNOW he doesn’t cheat. This is the same EAC that’s used in games like Rust and Fortnite, and he can still play those games at full capacity.  No mention of what program it could’ve been, no real explanation... nothing. I’ve been unable to play with my friend for the longest time and it makes me both upset and sad that this is still going on. So... if you’re dealt a terrible card like he was, good luck! Because for some reason they won’t tell you why or how you got banned. That’s money down the drain. No chance at a refund if you’ve been playing for awhile.  My second most frustrating ordeals are when I see Mediatonic tout brand new variations for maps that a small group of players have said are too easy/boring when adding spinning pillars or hammers should be -last- on their list. Players being bored of a single two-minute match is a non-issue. Players can ABSOLUTELY handle a dry spell of the same map if it means that the devs could spend time and resources fixing prevalent bugs that have been in the game since day one.  Some bugs and issues I can remember off the top of my head:  - Broken hoops in the hoop games where you successfully jump in them and don’t earn a point  -Grabbing the crown in Fall Mountain only for the grab to not register at all, so you fall and someone else grabs the crown. Sometimes I would literally be dangling on the crown because I haven’t let go for a good few seconds in hopes that it will register my win, but then someone else runs in and gets the win instead  -Falling in-between the middle of three hexagons in Hex-a-Gone because the velocity messes with your bean, thus falling onto the levels below, or just getting eliminated immediately into the slime  -Jumping on a “crack” between two adjacent platforms in Jump Showdown and having my input get eaten, so my bean just simply doesn’t jump and I get swept away  -Minor (but annoying) issues like where my bean will be placed if I fall in a weird zone during one of the gauntlet levels (ex: in Whirlygig with the middle shortcut with the fan at the end, if you fall in a very particular place surrounding it, the game sets you up at the very BEGINNING of the map. So trigger zones or respawn placements really desparately need to be looked at.)  I don’t want to leave a negative review because I know game dev work is a lot. I’m leaving one (and hopefully, just for now) in the hopes that this gets read and passed along.   Your playerbase doesn’t need new big yeetuses, it needs answers and relief from some of the bugs that hinder the very core of your game on a near-daily basis.   Us players can wait for new mechanics and silly shenanigans, but everything I listed above is also just some of the several handfuls of bugs and problems I’ve encountered so far, and I know I’m not the only player with these issues. A quick look on the most popular Fall Guys subreddit will show you similar complaints, too.  I’ve amassed many hours into this game and probably over 90-100 wins currently, so know that my issues come from a place of wanting to see this game thrive. I adore Fall Guys, you have something lovely in your hands, so all I hope is that you devote some love back into the facets that need it most right now. As much as I want more people to get into this game, it’s hard to recommend it in its current state. While I may be patient with its many bugs and disconnects, there is also many others who will leave the game flat because of it.  You can do better, just by re-focusing on what’s important. I hope I can change my review in the future, but please, I hope this all gets heard. I wish Mediatonic the best of luck."

97365813,english,1,1097150,I have over 1300 hours on this game and it has given me the time of my life. I could never find a game that fitted me because ever other game in the world has complicated controls with 60 buttons. Fall Guys with 4 buttons is so incredibly simple and fun and made mine and so many others lives better in quarantine. Happy Birthday fall Guys!!
74006830,english,1,1097150,"There's no doubt Fall Guys deserves every ounce of the hype it's receiving - the game is ridiculously fun and an absolute blast to play alone or alongside a handful of friends, easily knocking Gang Beasts and similar titles off of their pedestals.  I trust Mediatonic will listen to the outcry for new levels, balancing, and content... but Fall Guys [b]will[/b] inevitably get repetitive and boring in the long run. For this reason, I encourage them to say attentive to community feedback and not fall into the void of trend-games; to do so, Fall Guys could follow in these three steps:   [b]Step One - Essentials[/b]  To begin, there's clearly a few minor issues with the game that most people are reporting across all platforms - notably regarding team games. Working together to complete objectives is fun, but individual skill currently holds no weight when qualifying for the next round.  Solving this is straightforward; team games should stay, but players may individually qualify throughout the round if they score enough points or hold the objective for enough seconds. Playing team games during a semi-final is very disappointing, since it's hard to shake the feeling that you may not qualify for the finals due to a rogue teammate.  Aside from team games, the majority of the minigames are hilarious, but I really hope that we don't have to wait for the end of the season for new maps. Seasons are around 60 days long which concerns me since there's a chance that we'll be in the same rotation of maps for another 2 months.   [b]Step Two - Update and Innovate[/b]  Undoubtedly, the most obvious way to maintain an active playerbase is to add new maps and skins, but this option can only be done so much before stagnating - I really want to see Fall Guys reaching the numbers it's doing right now around this time next year. To do this, Mediatonic need to be actively innovating and bringing in new features beyond the base game. Examples include:  [i]8-player Parties[/i]  Doubling the party size would be a great first non-map/non-cosmetic update - this currently being the main barrier holding back a few of my friends from buying, since our group cannot fit in a single party.  [i]New Moves[/i]  Controlling your Fall Guy is genius in its simplicity. Jumping, diving, and grabbing seem basic on the surface, but play a huge role in finding shortcuts, eliminating other players or getting a final boost of speed before reaching the finish line. However, as there are still many unused keys on both keyboard and controller, it'd be great to throw in an extra move or two.  One idea may be a high risk, yet high reward 'punt' button, allowing you to kick over a nearby opponent after a few seconds of charging up. However, missing a kick would cause your character to tumble forward, leaving them at risk to obstacles or other players.  [i]Weekly Event Days[/i]  Counter-Strike's War Games and Fortnite's LTM's opened up a new market for developers to satisfy niches in their audience, but tend to be stale and unexciting after a while.  Rather than sticking to the cookie-cut format of scattering limited-time modes throughout the year, Mediatonic could innovate by claiming a specific day of the week, introducing a unique spin on the entire game for 24 hours. '100-player Fridays' may be feasible; a once-a-week alternative to standard 60 player matches, containing exciting minigames tailored for larger groups alongside prodigious rewards for those who secure the crown. Providing the community with interesting spins on standard gameplay in small but addictive chunks may assist Fall Guys in moulding into [i]""that game we always play on Fridays""[/i], gradually shifting towards a lifestyle game that keeps people coming back to play week by week.  [i]Streamer Lobbies[/i]  Streamers will often return to games that enable them to play with their community, or host games such as 'Marbles On Stream' allowing active viewers to compete for personalised gifts such as a paid subscription, shout-out, or merchandise. With minimal crossover in this niche already, Fall Guys has an opportunity to grant streamers the ability to open a private lobby - rather than compete for crowns, viewers instead join through a room code and compete for a predetermined prize at the discretion of the streamer.   [b]Step Three - Sustaining Beyond 2020[/b]  With a mixture of luck and commitment, Fall Guys could become a smash hit, continuing to flourish over many years. Without getting too ahead of themselves, Mediatonic could consider opening their game up to the Steam workshop later down the line so players can upload their own maps and modes for approval. This way, Fall Guys is never short of quality content and unique ideas for the years to come!   To summarise, Fall Guys is awesome yet still has legroom to grow even bigger and better. In spite of expected day one issues, Fall Guys is far from being just another washed up gimmick, on the exception that Mediatonic really knuckle down on content and balancing [b]before[/b] the first season ends.  I strongly recommend Fall Guys and wish the very best for Mediatonic moving forward!"
77232547,english,0,1097150,"The updates are extremely slow and underwhelming, they hyped up season 2 so much and all they added was like a few new game modes and a couple changes to already existing maps.  Otherwise, the game is repetitive and gets boring really fast."

83890236,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a battle royale game where the player must guide their character through a series of events inspired by TV shows like Takeshi’s Castle or Ninja Warrior. Starting with 60 players in the match, roughly 10-15 players will be eliminated each round until the match ends with 1 winner.  There are lots of different events in the rotation so you won’t see the same ones in every match. Some events have players competing individually while others divide the players up into either 2 or 3 teams, with everybody on the losing team being eliminated.  Some events are races, where the player must jump over bottomless pits, avoid obstacles such as swinging axes, balls on chains and spinning blades, and cross the finish line as quickly as possible. In other events you have to score points by jumping through hoops, carrying eggs to a nest or pushing giant balls into goals. Or you might just need to stand on a platform while hazards try to knock you off. In some events, falling off the level will let you respawn at a checkpoint and try again, while in others, falling into slime results in instant elimination.  This is the first game I’ve played in the battle royale genre, and I’m enjoying the challenge of trying to get a win. I’d imagine most experienced gamers will find the first couple of rounds fairly easy to qualify from, but in the later rounds with only the best players remaining, it can be tough. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve finished in second or third place.  If you’ve watched your favourite streamer play Fall Guys (there was a time when pretty much everybody on Youtube was playing) and get annoyed by other players, I can confirm I know exactly how they feel. There’s nothing worse than somebody jumping into you just as you touch a bouncepad, causing you to fly off the level at a random angle, or when somebody grabs you for no reason (like, on a race event where they’ve got nothing to gain because it slows them down too), or when you dominate a team event but your team loses anyway. In most events though, its possible to recover from a couple of errors and still qualify, and being the last person to qualify for the next round feels great.  If you make it through to the final round, a complete match should take around 20 minutes to play. You’ll earn a couple of types of currency based on how far you survived, which lets you unlock some wacky cosmetic items. In 20 hours of gameplay I haven’t noticed any bugs. The physics sometimes feels a bit random but I think that is intentional because its a weird gameshow. Controls feel fine on my Xbox 360 controller. The art style is colourful and the music for most rounds is entertaining.  Fall Guys is a fun (and occasionally annoying) game to play if you’re looking for some wacky multiplayer action. Don’t let the art style fool you, it gets quite competitive in the later rounds. And there’s enough content and replayability to justify the price."
121547856,english,0,1097150,"I do not recommend this game after it was taken off the steam platform and put on Epic Games. It's turned into micro-transaction hell. It doesn't matter if you win anymore, so why keep playing?"
100479163,english,1,1097150,"[h1] Video Games [/h1]   While Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout isn't nearly as popular as it was around the time it launched, it still remains a perfect video game for what it sets out to accomplish. Its presentation, gameplay, low skill floor and price tag make it accessible to anyone who'd want to give it a try. If you're looking for something refreshing to play with a group of friends, even those who might not be big on video games, then look no further.   Gameplay-wise, it is the best Wipeout or Ninja Warrior game (n?)ever made. You know, those shows where people have to beat an obstacle course in order to win the prize money? Here it’s a bit different, with up to 60 players thrown into a match, consisting of several rounds. At the end of every round, those who fail to complete the objective in time are eliminated. Not every round is an obstacle course however, but can be anything from a vast plethora of minigames spread into six different categories.   For example, Race rounds will always task you with reaching the finish line of the course before a certain number of players manage to. Survival rounds will require you to not get eliminated before a certain number of players does, or a timer runs out. These are then further differentiated by themes and obstacles. One Survival round might have you balance atop of an ever-moving platform, dodging projectiles launched at you, while another will place you in an arena with three giant Rhinos attempting to knock you out. Team rounds, which require you to work with random players towards a common goal to prevent your entire team from being eliminated are all about scoring points, but can either be a game of basketball, football (the soccer kind) or collecting as high of a number of eggs as possible.   In the main game mode, a match must always start with a Race and end with a Finale – the most suspenseful, final round of the match, usually a Race that only one player can win or a Survival round that keeps going until the last man standing. Other game modes, both fixed and rotating, focus on specific categories or levels themselves. There are also custom matches you can make for you and your friends.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618963922  Even if all rounds across a category follow a certain pattern, none ultimately feel the same. Additional obstacles will sometimes appear on maps they were previously absent from, so the game can still throw you a curveball even when you think you have them all memorised.   Still, some are clearly better designed than others. Door Dash, a Race round, is a course consisting entirely out of doors. Some of these are openable, while the others aren’t – with there being no way of telling between the two until you try going through them. It almost completely eradicates the momentum of the match. If you go for an unlocked door consistently enough, you’ll qualify. If you don’t, tough luck. Other levels that solely consist of multitudes of the same obstacle have a similar effect, though none are as bad as Door Dash.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618967222  The controls are quite tight due to how limited they are. You can jump, grab (players, ledges, objects and some objectives) and dive, so the game requires a total of three buttons to play – excluding movement. A controller is ideal, but the keyboard and mouse perform almost just as well.  Progression feels good, but it could be better. Winning a round will net you a Crown, the game’s ’’premium’’ currency awarded solely through wins or milestones in the current Season’s battle pass-like progression, called Fame levels – limited to 50 per Season and increased by XP, which is awarded for each match you play. Each Crown you acquire also increases your overall player rank, which awards you cosmetics upon leveling up and is separate from your Fame level.   Besides Crowns, there are Kudos, a second currency awarded at certain Fame levels, as well as upon completion of a match regardless of whether you won or not. Kudos can also be purchased through microtransactions, in bundles as costly as $50, more than twice the game’s price. While the game isn’t by any means stingy with its rewards, the progression does feel a bit staggered and the inclusion of microtransactions can’t help but make me think of some marketing analyst or currency designer figuring out how to optimize it best to incentivise a purchase. Even when they aren’t intrusive, they’re there for a reason.  Your rewards can be spent in the store for cosmetic items. Some cost Kudos, some cost Crowns. There’s a fixed number of items that can be displayed in the store at a time and they reset once a day. Simple as. Customization options for your Fall Guy are quite varied and some visually striking combinations are possible, even without playing much.  Visually, the game is a colorful joy to look at, with the audio making it all the more appealing. The Fall Guys make cute ’’oofs“ and other sounds when they collide with each other, and scream of excitement when an obstacle launches them into the air – all of it heightened by a groovy, bass driven soundtrack. It just oozes fun.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618970077  Performance wise, the game ran great on max settings, at a steady 60 FPS. However, the animation LOD distance wasn’t that great, as players and obstacles further away would be running at a notably lower framerate. I don’t know if this is simply the way the game’s optimised, or something affected by the limitations of my specs. Weirdly enough, the game would sometimes drop down to 30 FPS while waiting in the lobby or the post-match recap.   Reviewed on the following system:  [table][tr][td]CPU [/td][td]AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6GHz[/td][/tr][tr][td]GPU[/td][td]GeForce GTX 1050Ti[/td][/tr][tr][td]RAM [/td][td]16GB[/td][/tr][/table]  While the game’s current player numbers are a far cry from what it once had, it still maintains a healthy population, both on Steam and outside of it, thanks to cross-play. I wholeheartedly hope that Mediatonic can keep Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout in such a state, as it’s a fun game that truly anyone can play. Even if you don’t end up winning, the little animation your Fall Guy does during the post-match summary shows that he’s had a lot of fun even participating, just as you will. Here’s to hoping it can keep going strong in the years to come, at least as long until there’s a worthy successor.

The winner is determined by 3 types of mini-games: race, survival and team. Each next task depends on how many players are still competing. You can run, jump, do a racing dive and grab - that´s it. As in real life everyone lives out their character. You will be pushed into the abyss, jostled, attacked by teams and finally mocked before the finish line. Please also welcome the fraudulent plague of the digital age that is literally flying over the cuckoo's nest.

Yes, there are cheaters, but show me a multiplayer game where these dishonorable beings don´t show up. And yes, the unexpected success of Fall Guys initially completely overwhelmed the servers and you still may experience a disconnect or lag here and there. So what, go for the next round. Unfortunately there is a trend for negativity in reviews and forums these days because people have neither understanding nor patience anymore. And in the end all depends on how developers communicate with their player base and solve problems. They did a great job so far and seem to really care about their game.  [h1]Is Fall Guys worth your time and money?[/h1]  Absolutely! It´s screamingly funny and the first so-called Battle Royale that I enjoy.

Everything is colourful and playful and when I played each time the servers were pretty fast.    +  room for improvement.  We are in season 1 now and I hope that next seasons come with new maps.  There is a huge window of opportunity to keep the game fresh and therefore the play-count high.  The devs are going to have to really focus on this aspect because at 60 players per room, that's a helluva goal to set to keep this game alive.  But to be fair when you have a bunch of seasons of Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle to draw from for inspiration then we are all set for a few years I think.  +  maps.  There are a lot of maps but I haven't experienced them all yet in my 4 hours.  Some are better than others but everyone will have their own preferences.  Some maps are hectic scrums, others require a bit more platforming savvy techniques, others yet have a more physical dexterity aspect.

118666489,english,0,1097150,"I remember when I bought this game in 2021. A key part of that memory involves the fact that, at that time, I was actually able to, you know, play the game. (For a few hours. I think I snagged it during a sale, tried it out for a bit, and then planned on playing it more substantially later.)  Now. in 2022, I attempt to start the game up. I discover that there are now about 10 layers of Epic Games garbage retrofitted to the game; and so in addition to taking forever to launch, it never gets past the very first ""Loading"" screen. I literally can't even make it to the main menu. I've done all the usual troubleshooting steps, and nothing works. [b]It's just completely effing broken.[/b]  Add to that the various other controversial changes apparently done to the game in the time since the developers/publishers sold their souls to Epic Games (these changes are well-documented by others), and the only message I can reasonably say I'm getting from the people behind this game is a giant middle finger.  I'm currently attempting to get a refund, since I bought the game under a particular understanding, and the game has been completely changed in such a way that it no longer reflects the buying decision I originally made at all. (For example: when I bought it, I did so on the understanding that I would be able to, like, you know, [b]play the game[/b], or at least even get to the main menu. And while this was possible at the time I paid for the game, it's no longer possible.

Their game overlay system is apparently broken or fucked or whatever, and so it just doesn't bother to show up and inform you of what the hell you need to actually do. This is genius-level game design. Also, if you weren't able to figure out that ""infinite loading screen means I need to link my accounts"", then you are probably an idiot who will be yelled at by other, definitely much smarter, people for not being able to figure out such an obvious thing yourself.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840429916"
79725349,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout is one of the most popular of this year, so let's take a look at this Takeshi Castle inspired game. Since there's no story, let's jump into graphics.   Graphics:  Fall Guys has an absolutely amazing art style. The world is bright and colorful and the bean people you control are absolutely adorable. You can also buy different costumes and outfit your bean with the style that suits you the best. There will be that one costume that you will definitely want to save up for and bring into every game you go into.   The bright and colorful look of the world is an absolute joy. Everything is splattered with bright colors like pink, blue, yellow and others, it honestly reminded me of cartoons I would watch as a kid. The game is really pleasant to the eye and for that I got to give major props to the designers.   Audio:  The music of Fall Guys has no reason to be as good as it is. Most of the tracks are insanely catchy, especially the final round music which is by far the best track in the game. Most of the other ones are also really good and honestly I loved most of the tracks in the game.  One other thing is the sound effects. First of all, I got to admit that the sounds the beans make when expressing joy, sadness and when something happens when they bump into something or fall are incredibly adorable. That's the one thing that I never get sick of when playing the game.  Also the beans themselves look mushy and the sounds they make when bumping into things is oddly satisfying. Overall I think the audio design and it's a definite highlight of the game, especially the incredibly catchy soundtrack.  Gameplay:  Ever watched Takeshi's Castle ? Wipeout ? Well imagine if Fall Guys is the video game adaption of those two shows. The game is basically a battle royale where you go through obstacle courses until you're the last man standing. So let's talk about the meat and potatoes of the game, which is the courses.  There's a good variety of courses in the game, ranging from races, team games and survival games. Race courses are courses where you race to the finish line, while avoiding obstacles. Team games are usually objective games where you team up with other players to compete against other teams and lastly survival games where you avoid stuff trying to survive until enough players are eliminated.   The good majority of the courses are really well designed and fun to play, they rely on your skill and when you have one very clean run avoiding everything and coming out at the front is so satisfying, however a good majority of the courses are incredibly poorly designed.   First of all there's a few courses in the game where a few players have to sacrifice themselves so other players can win. This is mostly a problem in Tip Toe and Wall Guys, where a couple of players have to set up a path for the other players to follow, which will definitely mean they will lose.  Not to mention See Saw, where players will refuse to stand on one side because that will put them behind other players.  But those usually have nothing on the team games. Pretty much all of these are incredibly poorly designed. These game modes never rely on your skill, but the skill of the players that are assigned to your team. You might get unlucky and get players that leave that one course they simply hate and would rather just get into another game, or as soon as you're one point behind, they will start trolling. Most of these are incredibly tedious and when I get a team game,  I find the experience more tedious than fun.   Once enough players are eliminated you go into the finale. There's currently four different finales and honestly these are a mixed bag. The most poorly designed is Fall Mountain. This is a course where you race to the top of a mountain to grab a crown and this is a course that is purely dependent on the RNG of the game. If there's enough players for three rows, if you're in row three, you can basically give up before the game even begins.   Another one that I find incredibly stupid is Jump Showdown. In this one you're on platforms avoiding a pillar that keeps spinning, trying to knock you off, until there's only one man left standing. In this one the platforms keep falling off and there is a high possibility you can get stuck on a side that will lose all platforms with no way to recover. But if you do find yourself on the last few platforms left standing, then it's purely skill that can get you the win.   Also each course has different variations with different obstacles   Even with these negatives, I found the game a ton of fun and most of the courses incredibly fun, hopefully the bad ones get taken out of the game and reworked or the just vaulted entirely and I really want more skill based finales.   Verdict:  Fall Guys is a ton of fun and honestly even with it's issues I had an absolute blast going through the crazy courses, racing other players and getting that sweet sweet crown. Overall for the price you get a really solid multiplayer experience, which could last you countless hours. If you're looking for something bright to cheer you up in dark times, Fall Guys is definitely the game to go with.   Final Rating: 9/10  Pros: + Most courses are incredibly fun to go through + Bright and cute art style is pleasing to the eye + Amazing score   Cons: - Tons of courses depend on luck, rather than skill - Team games  If you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews"

73803912,english,0,1097150,"I'll start off with saying this is FAR from a bad game, and definitely has potential to be a great and fun experience, but right now it just has some glaring issues that really put me off from playing more than just a few games, I heavily encourage you to look up more reviews and gameplay to decide if it's something for you but here's what nags me personally;  [h1]Repetitiveness[/h1] Right now it's difficult for me to really keep going as you keep seeing the same maps over and over in just a few hours of playtime, and most of these involve running forward from one end to the other before X amount of players do, with the inspiration this game draws from Takeshi's Castle this is understandable, but I feel like more could be done in this regard to make the average game more varied.  [h1]Team games feel awful[/h1] Generally I enjoy the game in short bursts, but I have absolutely never enjoyed any of the team games, it honestly just feels like a 2 minute wait to roll your 66% or 50% chance to not be eliminated, this isn't helped by the fact teams can be uneven in terms of player numbers and objectives spawning at random in some of these minigames, I really wish there was an option to opt out of these.  [h1]Winning as a currency[/h1] This is entirely subjective, but I hate this, of course there's skill involved but winning is mostly a random ordeal from my experience, yet there's time-limited cosmetics you can only obtain by winning 10 or so games, quickly shifting the focus from lighthearted fun to just getting annoyed if you don't get the crown should you be interested in any of those cosmetics. I really wish there was no arbitrary time limit on these things or another way to get the currency so you can steadily progress, the pressure to win is something I don't enjoy in a casual party game, of course reward the winner but please don't lock things solely behind winning games.  [h1]Final rounds are very discouraging.[/h1] Currently there are 3 minigames for the final round to decide the winner, two of these feel utterly pointless to me as one of them is a race, but you spawn in 2 rows, if you don't spawn in the first row you've generally lost from the second it starts. The other game involves holding an item when a timer runs out, which generally just results in running in a circle for 2 minutes, only to end up in a clump of people for the last few seconds, mashing the grab button and praying you have the thing when the clock runs out, which is more frustrating than anything. The third game is one I actually enjoy where you need to move across disappearing platforms in multiple layers to avoid falling down, the last one standing wins, this doesn't feel as random or reliant on luck and makes for a much more fun experience, I hope more final minigames follow this trend.   All that said, I'm still excited to see where this game goes, as new maps and minigames are already planned, and I'm already very close to recommending the game."
73975501,english,1,1097150,"There is just something about running head first into doors as a cute bean in a raptor outfit, 60 people bumping into each other, sounds of hitting squeaky toys all around, that is very repetitive, but makes you want to keep coming back everytime."
127871314,english,0,1097150,"Played over 300 hours and it used to be a lot of fun. The devs have always taken questionable paths regarding level rotation and game updates in general, but since the Epic takeover this game has dropped into the bin.   Same maps day in day out, bearing in mind there are around 100 potential levels to choose from, yet hardly ever get to play them (some of which seem to have been permanently discarded).  Mundane season changes which again force monotonous rotation ad nauseum.  Terrible take over by EpicGames which means frequently you can't even play the game when the servers are down, and also a freemium content model which removes the ability to earn anything worthwhile in the game such as  new costumes, as these have become accessible only for real money. You can still use the in-game currency to buy backpacks and shoes though, so there you go. woo.  Disgrace."
84528738,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Fall Guys[/h1] With a massive cheating problem the first half of the 1st season it was pretty much unwinnable. After upgrading their anti-cheat it became much more enjoyable as you could win a few games. Sadly with that rough start and to slow content additions (if any at first), a lot of players left the game. It is the main problem with a game like Fall Guys, it gets old playing the same maps constantly. Season 2 had mediocre content, but Season 3 is by far the best season so far seen to content.  Fall Guys also suffers a lot from haters and labeling. The game is not Dead by any means and it people still spam and try to massively downplay the game, a lto havent even tried it... As goes with the labeling it isnt a casual game at all. Play with your little children and they will most likely fail to qualify from the first round and a lot of players statistically havent even won a full episode once. While skill is needed, it is very RNG dependant. To make it even worse there is a clear adv/disadvantage between players. Players are not affected by collision, grabbing and phisics equally. This explains why so few have less than 20 wins. The game greatly rewards skilled players, especially those with advantage. Notice that golden person that is ungrabbable, that can walk into you moving you a long while if you do it you wont move them an inch. Do you fall more often and take much longer to get up? Just watch a top player stream and compare your game, I can say mine isnt the same as theirs...  So to summerize some things the game has a good community, lots of haters and heavily rewards the top 1% of the game, it is probably fun for most people for a while, but many wont last even 5-10 hours. Since they have episode varriations now I mostly play when good structured ones appear like the recent Hex-a-gone only one so I dont get bored.  Ignoring bad phisics, adv/dis etc. the game suffers from some other problems aswell. For instance some people have a lot of disconnects and team games suffer from balancing when te teams are uneven. If your side is losing you dont get punished at all from leaving early and solidifying a loss for the team, 3 team games many teams end by simply having 2 teams gang up against one team which the game has no mechanics to balance against. Lastly, for some reason they have an achievement for winning 5 episodes in a row. Devs WTF, are you serious? Disconnects break the streak aswell and early people used exploit to get it by leaving if they werent sure they would win to keep the streak...  In conclusion the game is fun, for a while but grows old rather quicky. It doesnt take that long to finish the season pass and has been easier with each season. Better players with not too much disadv get waaay more rewarded than other player with much higher playtimes and can usuallly buy everything constantly in the shop (cosmetics).  I recommend Fall Guys since it provides a good amount of fun and suits a lot of different people. I hope they further balance the game between bad and good players, it doesnt really make much sense pitting the best against the worst in a battle royal and denying many players the ability to get a single win. The biggest issue of being vastly unfair between players hopefully will get smaller as they keep optimizing and polishing the game.  //ECE//"

Removing the game from the Steam store was a horrible idea as well, even though there are more than 100k reviews (mostly positive). When Epic bought Fall Guys, it has made the game which we as people who bought it, worthless and a waste of money.   Shame on you Epic"
89172453,english,1,1097150,"This game is really fun If you play in squad with your friends. The new season which came out in March 2021 is the best one so far.   Epic Games recently bought Fall Guys and that's a good move for reviving this game again. I think with this will come new content more often. My opinion is that If two more seasons will come with equally well-crafted maps as in this season, Fall Guys will be one of the best games which you can play to chill with your friends."

75936183,english,1,1097150,"Fall guys is super funny to play, and what's most ironic is that the chaos in game is also a funny part! For some reason this game reminds me of that old japanese TV show 'Takeshi's castle' where also, 50 or more competitors, have to go through a series of obstacle parcours and who makes it to the finale can play the finale.  Only difference was that all competitors didn't had to go through the obstacle parcours all at once, and this is what this game makes so much fun,  Imagine 60 players all together trying to be the first to squeese through a moving door, or how you will always fail to balance a platform to move to the next. Every obstacle parcour or level task in this game is worth to play it, even losing is fun.

I've tried all the avenues I could to fix the issue; the official discord said to email support through a form (which I did over a week ago and have got no response), I looked in the FAQ and found no solution, and reached out via twitter. I re-installed the game half a dozen times and verified the integrity of my game files even moreso. The servers are completely online, and when I play with friends, I prevent my whole team from being able to enter a match. I can connect to other games that use EAC, and I've tried every other day since the mid season patch to no avail.

74881907,english,1,1097150,"Have you ever wondered what shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle would look like in Video Game form? Say hello to Fall Guys since that’s essentially what it is, and boy is it fun.  [h1]What I like:[/h1]  + Fall Guys has a wide variety of games that provide their own set of challenges. They’re not all brilliant, but they stand out and are entertaining. Some people say there aren’t enough games, but personally I think there’s enough to justify the price.  + Fall Guys isn’t a complex game. Each level has a simple goal, whether it being to jump over obstacles or bash through the right door and reach the finish line. The overall objective is to qualify each round until you reach the final round for the ultimate victory. Given time, anyone can pick this up and eventually win a game.     + The game has a colourful art style that is very effective at luring people in and hiding how frustrating the game can be. The visual design of the levels, although simple, is nice to look at, and the character designs are iconic.   + The game is challenging. Fall Guys will inevitably get you angry at some point, whether it’ll be because of the wacky physics or somebody getting in the way. It’s both the silliness and the competitiveness that make this game really fun to play.  + As well as being challenging, it’s also addicting. Sure, it doesn’t take long to end up playing the same games again and again but that didn’t bother me much because each round felt different. It’s all dependant on who you’re put up against.   + There is a vast amount of customisation items for your character, ranging from colours, patterns and outfits. The devs regularly introduce cross over events with other games. At the time of writing, they have done TF2, Portal 2 and Enter the Gungeon. There is also a free battle pass that gives you cosmetics as you progress.          [h1]What I don’t like:[/h1]  - Team games are definitely hit or miss. Sometimes they’re great. Sometimes they’re awful. The problem is that people leave as soon as their team is losing, screwing over the people who are trying. I don’t mind team games, but it would be nice if there could be two types of match searches; one type being solo games only, and the other being a mix of the two.  - I can’t say I like the tail games. The hitboxes for them seem really inconsistent. There were times where I should’ve grabbed the tail but the game failed to detect it. That or I’m just really bad. It could be that.  - Although not as bad as they used to be, server issues are still prevalent. Disconnects and lag spikes will happen every so often. Speed hackers and cheaters are also a problem. Yes people hack in this game, it's incredible really.   [h1]My Overall Thoughts:[/h1]  Fall Guys has become insanely popular since release and I can understand why. It’s a unique take on a battle royale that manages to make the genre enjoyable to people who despise it. The fact that it still has a massive playerbase shows that the devs did many things right.  As I mentioned before, it’s the silliness and competitiveness in each round that make this game enjoyable and memorable. It’s meant to be frustrating. It’s meant to be over the top. And it’s really damn fun. The game has a charm that I personally haven’t seen much of in multiplayer games.  That being said, the game is far from perfect. Fall Guys had a rough launch server wise and still has a way to go. It also has a hacker problem which is in the process of being fixed. The game still needs some new features such as advanced searches as well as tweaks to already existing game modes.   Fall Guys isn’t necessarily a game you will play for a prolonged period of time, but it’s a brilliant pick if you want something to spend the time. It’s great on your own and it’s great with friends, and with its current price tag, I’d say it’s worth it.

With simple controls, heaps of fun, replayable mini-games and customizations (paid or won) that do not alter the gameplay, and a catchy background tune, Fall Guys has everything that causes addictive play. Indeed, even when you are eliminated, there is the immediate urge to hop back in and try your luck again. The only thing that lets Fall Guys down is the inability to play local matches against friends on your couch. The vibrant levels, with their inflatable-like obstacles and moving platforms wouldn’t be out of place on a TV game show. Indeed, I’m now looking forward to the Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout TV adaption, where players must don Fall Guy suits and compete in a similar series of wacky and enjoyable events. Until then, Fall Guys will be my multiplayer game of choice."
92550457,english,1,1097150,"If you asked me if I'd recommend this game when it first came out, I'd say no. Back then, it was pretty much the same 10 minigames over and over, which got boring REALLY fast.   But now, as of the time I'm writing this (season 4.5) there are 46 different minigames, and that number doesn't include the fact that many minigames have random variations that might change up the game significantly, so really the amount of UNIQUE minigames is probably up in the hundreds. Now I can play for an hour and barely see any repeat minigames, which was basically impossible when this game first launched.   TL:DR The game used to be boring, but now it isn't since the devs added (and are continuing to add) a bunch of new minigames which helps keep it fresh.  Plus the music has no right being that good"
79841325,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” burst onto the gaming scene with a splash in August 2020, capturing the hearts of players with its unique blend of chaotic fun and colorful, whimsical aesthetics. Developed by Mediatonic, this battle royale-style party game quickly became a cultural phenomenon, celebrated for its vibrant graphics, quirky challenges, and family-friendly appeal. Unfortunately, despite its initial success, “Fall Guys” is no longer available on Steam, leaving many fans longing for its return on the platform.[/b]  [h1]Gameplay and Appeal[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” offers a delightful twist on the battle royale genre, replacing the intense combat with a series of absurdly fun mini-games and obstacle courses. Players control customizable jellybean-like characters as they navigate through increasingly difficult rounds, all while avoiding elimination. The game's charm lies in its accessibility; anyone can pick up and play, making it a great choice for both casual gamers and those seeking a lighthearted competitive experience.  The vibrant, cartoonish art style and upbeat soundtrack create an inviting atmosphere, enhancing the enjoyment of its frenetic gameplay. Each round is a chaotic spectacle, where strategy and timing blend with a healthy dose of luck. Whether you're dodging swinging hammers or leaping across precarious platforms, the sheer unpredictability of each match ensures that no two games are ever the same.[/b]  [h1]The Hype[/h1]  [b]At launch, “Fall Guys” was met with widespread enthusiasm and quickly garnered a dedicated player base. Its appeal was amplified by its engaging, easy-to-learn gameplay and the ability to play with friends, which made it a popular choice for streamers and content creators. The game's success was further fueled by regular updates, seasonal events, and collaborations with various franchises, which kept the content fresh and exciting.[/b]  [h1]The Downfall[/h1]  [b]Despite its early success, “Fall Guys” faced significant challenges over time. One of the major issues was the server instability and connectivity problems that plagued players, particularly during peak times or after major updates. These technical difficulties detracted from the overall experience and led to frustration among the player base.  More critically, the decision to remove “Fall Guys” from Steam was a disappointing turn for many. The game transitioned to a free-to-play model and launched on other platforms, including Epic Games Store, which led to its withdrawal from Steam. This shift was met with mixed reactions, as it left a portion of the community unable to access the game through their preferred platform.  The transition also meant that future updates and new content were no longer available to Steam users, diminishing the game's visibility and impact on the platform. While the game’s cross-platform functionality ensured that players on other platforms could still enjoy it, the Steam community was left feeling somewhat abandoned.[/b]  [h1]Conclusion[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” remains a memorable entry in the gaming landscape, celebrated for its whimsical charm and engaging gameplay. While the decision to remove the game from Steam was a blow to many fans, the game's legacy endures through its continued presence on other platforms and the fond memories it created during its peak.[/b]  [i]The game’s hype was well-deserved, as it brought a fresh and entertaining twist to the battle royale genre. However, the challenges it faced, particularly the platform transition and technical issues, highlight the difficulties of maintaining momentum in a highly competitive market. For those who experienced its glory days on Steam, “Fall Guys” will always be a beloved reminder of the fun and chaos of its unique gameplay.[/i]"

Yes, for a limited short time.  With the current amount of content available within Fall Guys, I would have priced this game at around $5.  If they decide to add (A LOT) more content later on, than perhaps this game is justifiable at $20, but currently I wouldn't imagine playing Fall Guys for more than about 2 hours.   *Voted Positive, because the game is truly fun, and I don't want to bash it just for the price*"
94862122,english,0,1097150,"This is a hard review to make as I have a mixed feeling about the game overall. I've stuck with it ever since Season 1 and never really stopped playing it except for Season 3. You could say I just really, really want the game of this type to succeed.  What pulls me in is the unique [strike]tournament style[/strike] battle royale gameplay you have. It's just a bunch of minigames (47 as of writing of this) that you face randomly. The pull of this game for me is that you can play solo, that it's a platformer-ish BR and that it creates unique combos of levels every match. The first few rounds are often easy, not punishing and include quite a bit of random. For example - Door Dash is pretty much RNG - you slam against doors and hope they're not fake. Pretty RNG if you ask me, but it only spawns with at least 40 players, which you are very likely not to be at after round 2. On the other hard, the finals are supposed to be hard, skill-testing experiences, because only one winner emerges and that winner wins the whole show.  The problems arise when you actually take more than 2 seconds to look at the game. Back when this game first released, PC had a massive cheater problem which persisted for ~40 days until they finally released a mid-season patch. At that point most mainstream players weren't even playing anymore. This is an example of how horrible Mediatonic (the devs) are at game polish. This game has had constant polish issues. Season 4's release was a bugfest - they introduced the new Squads Show (which I liked), but it was very buggy - almost as if the devs never even tested it, or tested it with such strange priorities, that they only ever cared about fixing the game-breaking bugs. Speaking of priorities, I find Mediatonic a strange outlier in this category as well - most developers, for example, Mojang with Minecraft, push out multiple bug fix updates after their newest release to make sure that players have the least buggy experience before starting work on new features. That's not how it works for Mediatonic! Every season, they appear to have this cycle: * Season drops - new features, meaning new bugs * One hotfix a few days later or a week later (at least the one that the community gets notified about) * A lot of time passes * Mid-season patch - fixes bugs AND adds new features (new bugs) * More time passes * Repeat I assume Mediatonic is on a time crunch or something, because they are trying to dish out new features as quickly as possible...  Asides from polish, the design of the game is questionable as well. The most distinct and unique features of Fall Guys is what you play as - you play as beans which are designed with kinda strange physics. They can fall over, get hit, stretch (visually) and flip over... but they can also get flung or... just act strange and unpredictable. Fall Guys doesn't offer solid server sync. I've never seen myself get teleported or re-synced with the server somehow - the server doesn't control any of that. What this means is Fall Guys has one of the worst desync I've seen of all games. You can be sure that most of the players you see on your screen are actually at least a bit ahead. Near the end of races, I often see players disappear off the map BEFORE they cross the line. The problem with this is when you play tail tag games and Jinxed, where the game OBJECTIVE, depends on something that's desynced... Luckily it's usually not THAT bad. I pretty much never had strong issues with Tail Tag, Royal Fumble and games like that. What's more annoying is the more prevalent mechanic - GRABBING. Grabbing is the strongest mechanic when it comes to interacting with players. What's annoying about it, is that you can get grabbed by a desynced player who looks like he's really behind you (on whose screen you're closer to them). When that happens, you will literally get flung backwards against your win and then stuck for a bit... It's also annoying because the duration for which you get stuck appears to be random. Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's long. Also, if you are the one to grab a player, you also kind of get stuck. It's annoying because when you stop holding the key to grab, there's a noticeable delay to get unstuck from the grabbing position. This is a flimsy mechanic that is now integral to the game, giving the game it's own 'feel', which really sucks, because it's often frustrating to many players and is the main way to grief other players. I get that there needs to be a way to interact with others, but I really wish it was less annoying than that. There are even more issues with desync, but I don't think Steam can handle my review to be much longer....  I know I've said that Fall Guys seems to pertain a pattern where the first rounds are easy and kinda random, while last rounds require skill, but really isn't the reality - it's just a pattern people WANT to see. There are currently 6 finals in the game. The final that requires the most skill is Jump Showdown, but on paper it sounds really boring - it's just a final version of Jump Club with a top and bottom 2-sided baton, where the bottom baton speeds up over 5 minutes that the round lasts. The only other thing about the final that is unique, is that its floor divided into 8 parts is slowly destroyed down to 2, limiting your running space (and introducing unfair RNG that is STILL not fixed!). That sounds boring... but unfortunately simple rounds are like that are somewhat common in Fall Guys (which in my opinion isn't an issue that much). What's the issue are the other finals. I don't have strong issues with Royal Fumble, though people considered it the worst final. My issue is with finals like Fall Mountain or as I like to call it ""RNG Mountain"". The game is a climb upwards with very unpredictable elements determined by RNG. Due to lack of autonomy over your characters, it's often impossible to dodge or gain a benefit from oncoming projectiles. In my opinion this was the worst final until Season 4.5, where they managed to outdo themselves somehow. Mediatonic, on a quest to add more variations, decided to add low gravity to (the overrated) Hex-A-Gone and Thin Ice... this turned them into the most boring finals ever. Because everyone has very large jumping range and all of it is very slow, it becomes child's play until the final moment of the final. At that final moment, the only thing that impacts the result is who jumps LAST and spends the most time midair. That's the winner! That's it! Who thought this was a good idea? I understand the will to add more variations, but there are so many better ways to do it! How about you change the positions of hexes? How about you make interesting layers out of them??? Or what about making special new types of hexes that do something? There are so many things you could do but you didn't bother... What's also upsetting is the choice of what Mediatonic chooses to even add in each season. Consider the fact that every single season since release had ALWAYS added new Team games... you know, the game archetype that MOST players hate??? From noobs to pros, most HATE Team games. They are only good in Squads Shows imo. Team is arguably one of the biggest archetypes in the game with most rounds, while also being the most hated type of game. Season 3 is the only season to have added new Finals. What's upsetting is that these 'new' Finals are just Final reskins of already existing games! They added Roll Off, which is the final version of Roll Out and they added Thin Ice, a more boring variation of Hex-A-Gone... That's how creative they are despite the constant streams of suggestions they opened up for themselves, they couldn't come up with anything more original.  I'll end this review here for now. There are more issues with the game, like the controversies Mediatonic had with exclusive skins, worrying monetization and Mediatonic's belligerence with trackers. I still like the game and really wish it improved... 6/10"

80550533,english,1,1097150,"Look here me out, This game is a masterpiece as it allows for casual players to have fun, but also rewards more competitive gamers with the allure of a battle royale. It can seem repetitive to some people but the silliness of it all keeps you hooked. Some people may get frustrated by the randomness of certain rounds (team battles) but it is easy to jump back in and try again. The microtransactions aren't intrusive and are very rewarding for low prices, so people who are willing to spend can get the best value out of it. The battle pass is even free! And the soundtrack just fills you with an adrenaline rush. Overall, this game is for those who value fun over competition and winning and it really pays off to just enjoy it. Have fun falling!"
81541983,english,1,1097150,"Especially good and fun with friends, but... 6 months after release and still disconnects in every ""show""? Thats a fucking joke?"
75610402,english,0,1097150,"This game is more fun to watch than play. It's hilarious at times but becomes repetitive too quickly, no point of playing with your friends either. I had 2 cheaters in my first game that just flew to the finish line. I'm refunding this but willing to give it an another chance if they improve co-op and implement a proper anti-cheat system."
81782830,english,1,1097150,"You might not like it, but this is what peak Battle Royale looks like.  The level design is based on the idea that each level is 50% skill and 50% random. So, there will be chaos, and frustration, but also this will create some hilarious moments. More than once I have found myself actually laughing out loud.  I think the graphics are neat, and you can have some funny costumes for your bean; all the while listening to a soundtrack that just fits.  The only real problem with the game is its netcode, this creates a lot of situations that feel, and are, unfair.   Rating: Fail guys.  *Editors' Pick* https://pixelloot.com"
154350608,english,0,1097150,Epic ruins games  Bought this game for $20 before epic had anything to do with it and my progress was taken because I changed my linked epic account
87075938,english,0,1097150,"This is a good game to play with a group of 3 other friends, and it's can be a good game for children.  Other than that, this game was Game of The Month in August of 2020.  Sadly, Fall Guys gets very repetitive, as the algorithm that decides which level you play will often give you the same levels over and over again. Not to mention if you are playing the game by yourself, it can be very frustrating as every player(as well as the level) is working against you, and no one is working with you.  There was a time during season 1 when Fall Guys actually favored those who were skilled at the game. Sadly they eventually started changing it so that there were so many obstacles that skill no longer will help you much with winning as it once did. And even when there weren't so many obstacles to get in your way, there used to be hackers in season one to keep you from winning. Apparently Mediatonic thought it was fine to replace hackers with moving obstacles to keep this game from being at all skill based when it comes to winning. This is one of the few games that I know of where you can get good at the game and never win a crown by actually winning. I know so many people who have played this game, only to get second place, and never first.  Honestly, the most disappointing part of Fall Guys isn't even anything I just listed. The most disappointing part of it, that I find, is that at most, there are only 2 game modes at any given time. I remember how when everyone I knew was playing this game would talk about how awesome it would be if at least streamers could organize their own games with 60 or less players from their chats. Sadly, this game doesn't get much added to it, other than skins. Yeah, there are just a few new levels every season, but not much changes about this game, as it is largely luck based and is a waste of time for players like myself.  All in all, this game was over-hyped and likely will not stand the test of time. I don't recommend it to anyone looking for a good game, unless they like repetitiveness."
107946780,english,0,1097150,"If you want to get into this game, I recommend looking into some of these features within the game before making your judgement. This post will be a cumulative list of the worst of Fall Guys, and will go on for a while, so be warned.  Going into this list, I want you to keep two key facts in mind. Number one, take into consideration this quote, in its absolution, no edits, no paraphrasing, from the March 2nd, 2021 official Mediatonic release about their acquisition by Epic Games:  [quote=Mediatonic]""Joining forces with Epic will accelerate our plans to improve the game and bring Fall Guys to as many players as possible, while continuing to support the community.""[/quote]  Second, consider the fact that most, if not all, of the clips I will be sharing were delivered [b]on level release[/b]. Some of these features date back to the game's early months. I want you to consider this: an error in the game that lasts a couple of weeks is a bug, a hitch in the experience. If that issue persists into month durations, that's no longer a bug. That's the experience the developers want you to be having while playing this game.  These are the types of experiences that the developers have left unchecked for several months, and thus, want you to be experiencing by buying this game.

Improving the game, and supporting the community. Allowing players to experience the true, undeterred Fall Guys experience that Mediatonic wants you to experience when you play the game.   I ask you, though. Surely if these were to be considered bugs and glitches, then Mediatonic would absolutely take time to remedy these issues, and if these were issues to begin with, then keeping them within the game for several months and counting means that the community is [i]wrong[/i], and these are indeed the improvements promised to us with the newly acquired resources necessary to bring the game to its best potential.  All of the links I provided aren't just occasional [strike]bugs[/strike] features that have blipped in and out throughout Fall Guys' lifespan. These have and have always appeared consistently and throughout the game's whole entire lifespan, and have never once been taken out of the game. At best, these can be considered controversial additions to gameplay, and at worst, these are haphazard displays of lack of support and a disconnect from the community to sustain the game properly.   I absolutely adore this game, and have grudged through its tenure in my library balancing the good and the bad. I've been through its original fad status, the lack of updates and disappointing Season 2, the savior of Squads mode reincarnating the game, the custom playlist cycles, and have been a day 1 player in each and every new season. After hundreds of hours, I can definitely mark my feelings down in this review. This is a good game with a horrible company, not malicious or evil, but absurdly lazy to the point that the most dedicated players aren't here just cause they're good - it's that these above experiences are so integrated into daily gameplay that at this point we just don't care anymore."
85835494,english,1,1097150,"this is a great game it has grown tremendously so let me enlighten those people who dropped the game halfway through season one.  1. repetition: the minigames are more diverse than ever, there are so many more minigames than in season 1, especially with the new update. Every show is different from one another especially with all the new side shows.  2. glitches: REDUCED TO ZERO, there are practically no more glitches in season 3 making the playing field even for everyone  3. cost: The cost is much more worth it! multiplayer is more enjoyable, and you get way more minigames and fun for your precious money, I assure you, $20 is a very good price  To sum it up this game is very good, if any of you dropped the game and have not played since season 1, you should change that."

I refuse to link my Steam account with Epic due to it being nothing more than a privacy invasion and a massive data-grab of Steam users.  When I purchase a game I do so taking the risk whether it is bad or not, that I accept, but to bring in account linking and passing information to another separate service AFTER my purchase, thereby changing my aggreement, that's just plain wrong."

Once you get your first win, the game just becomes completely stale. Even with the new maps, I find myself playing cheap knockoffs more often than the actual game.

It's not because I'm afraid they'll dislike me or think I'm a freak or anything, it's that I just can't pinpoint an answer. I mean, yeah, the sexual attraction was always there, but I don't think that's really it. My dad was an alcoholic. He was never really there, he was always wasting his time and money at the bar. Before he left for the bar, he would always tell me, ""You stay there and play those games and if you're not there when I get back… well boy, there'll be hell to pay"". So I played video games. My favorite game was Fall Guys. I just loved that bean; the way he talked, the way he sang and dance. It was great. I… I guess I looked at Fall Guy as the father I never had. I mean, he taught me how to ride a bike, he taught me how to swim, he taught me everything. But I didn't just want to be LIKE Fall Guy, I wanted to BE him. Well, here I am, Fall Guy.

119268215,english,0,1097150,"Epic Games had to ruin everything. Removed the game from Steam, made it free and added microtransactions. Players that bought the game received awful rewards for buying it after it got free to play, and all the crowns we earned were turned into Kudos, a currency that is now obsolete because Epic created their own currency, the Show Bucks. Now most of the items use this new coin that players can only get by spending money, making the game less fun to play. In the past Players could get most skins if they were skilled enough for free, but now 80% of the good skins need to be paid with an exaggerated price, these skins are way to expensive for what they are worth especially considering they were obtainable with the old currency of the game that was free and could be earned by just playing it. It is so ironic that players that pre-ordered the game received a Gordon Freeman skin, a character made by Valve the creator of Steam, for the game now leaving Steam and join Rocket League on one of the worst Gaming Companies possible. I really feel betrayed with the decisions of the game devs because I always supported the game even in awful situations like the cheating problem, now to see everything *fall* apart, very sad to know that money can change anyone and make the worst mistakes ever. Last but not least I don't understand how people could accept this situation, why should these type of decisions should be accepted nowadays, if something like this happened in 2012 people would riot for a change, but nowadays it is something normal that people are used to, sadly. This may be the biggest reason why I prefer old games, no lazy unfinished products at day 1, no microtransactions, just a simple good game with good unlockables FOR FREE. Gaming companies are greedy and will want more, and in the future things will be way worse. We really shouldn't accept these actions, but sadly I guess we're too late.

75082098,english,1,1097150,"Here's what I see in this game: potential. Is it the best designed game out there? No. Is it the best multiplayer game out there? No. Is it the best optimized game out there (at least at the time of writing)? No. But what it does have is an amazing base game that's incredibly addicting. Even for the $20 its selling for, which in my opinion is a bit high, it's still a fantastic game that is incredibly fun to play with a group of friends.  Obviously there's a lot missing here: private multiplayer, custom matches, the lack of maps, actually being able to use your own name (lol), and the crackdown on cheating (to be completely fair I haven't encountered any). If you're skeptical about the game, I wouldn't blame you for waiting for it to go on sale or waiting until more content is added. We've seen this song and dance before: games release with a bare bones experience that's wildly fun, but gets old fast. That being said, I hope the developers continue to make this game better and better. Cut them some slack too, they got flooded with a player base they couldn't have expected. Let them get back on their feet after the floodgates opened, and show us what they can do.  Please keep going devs, I'm having a ton of fun so far but it's got a bit of a ways before it's really amazing. 8/10."
98256210,english,1,1097150,Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.  It's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!
74696182,english,1,1097150,"The Devolverland Expo led me to Fall Guys.  I was a little reluctant to get involved in a Battle Royale style game as I generally suck at competitive play but the sheer gleeful hilarity of this game more than makes up for the frustrations.  Are there server issues?  Sure.  Are there filthy filthy cheaters?  Oh you know it!  Am I still terrible?  Hoo boy am I ever.  Is it filled with bright colours, upbeat music, snappy mini games and lovable characters all bumbling their way to victory or slime?   Yes, yes it is and I love it.   +++UPDATE+++  So now I've played for, gee forty hours, seriously?  In that time I have managed to win two episodes.  Bear in mind I am terrible.  Two victories out of hundreds of failures.  Sweet sweet victories.  This sounds like a pretty bad ratio but really each victory feels truly momentous especially considering the ever increasing number of cheating hackers.  The cheating was something I could overlook when it was rare, but now it is the norm and it is really making me lose interest.  This is supposed to be Fall Guys, NOT Fly Guys.  There is very little competitive edge when you know the dude who is hovering above the level is going to automatically win!  I am now at the grinding stage just trying to collect the rest of the cosmetics for the season.    The initial shine has definitely dulled, and unless Mediatonic add some kind of anti cheat, this is going to quickly lose the large casual audience.  We shall see what Season 2 brings, but if the hackers are going to be allowed to continue operating I don't see myself joining the ranks of hopeful suckers never able to get a legitimate win.   ===UP-UPDATE===  So now I'm deeper than sixty hours in and Mediatonic have indeed listened to the criticisms levelled at their tiny little behemoth of a game.  There is now an anti cheat running in the background, which I know has been a bone of contention in some other releases (hello DOOM: Eternal) but it was desperately needed here and to be fair, I haven't happened upon any filthy dirty hackers since.  So now I can get back to being terrible through my own volition.  There has also been a refreshing of the levels.  A remixing of sorts.  The old tried and tested games have been given a lick of fresh paint and are all just a little bit different.  Clockwise rotating beams now might rotate anti-clockwise.  Wrecking balls that swung along the x axis now might swing along the y axis.  And there are random spinning hammers all over the shop.  It has definitely breathed fresh life into the game and really all my previous complaints have now been addressed.  Jolly well played there chaps.  Good form indeed.  Right, I'm off back to my glorious upbeat technicolour failure..."
117568023,english,0,1097150,"Once again, Epic Games sticks their greedy fingers into anything they can get their hands on. Their recent overhaul monetizes the hell out of the game, and they've screwed over long time players.  1. You're no longer able to get rare skins through playing the game alone, you now have to pay. The free currency (that was already a decent grind to get) can only be used to buy common stuff now.  2. Previously, crowns were typically used to purchase rare skins. They were only obtained through high placement, or very slowly through leveling. Now that crowns have been removed, there is far less incentive to actually grind and get good at the game.  3. Skins that used to be event exclusive are now being sold in the shop, which is unfair for anyone who had them.  4. Old legendary color skins are now common/rare, which is also unfair for those who had them.  It's been a good run, but I'm through with this game. There's literally nothing to play for anymore. I cant even finish the last achievement on my steam list without forking out cash, even though I ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME.  I hated Epic Games with a passion before this, and somehow they continue to find ways to remind me to keep hating them."

148095686,english,0,1097150,"""Fall Guys is a free, cross-platform massively multiplayer party royale game"" ""Fall Guys is no longer available on the Steam Store""  Epic Games bought out Fall Guys and immediately pulled it from Steam because they didn't like that they had to give a cut of the profits to Steam. Then they made a PAID GAME into a free to play game, modifying the cosmetic shop so you can buy the cosmetics with real money (which degrades the value of the cosmetics, seeing as they were originally earned with crowns) and adding a battlepass with a premium track.  The game has since been going downhill. I really must wonder at what point developers will learn to not let Epic Games buy them out, and I'm also wondering when people will stop giving money to a corporation that clearly hates them.

98963553,english,1,1097150,"I've spent a ton of time playing this game, so I want to do my best to give an honest review of the game and do it justice.  A basic explanation on what the game is, would be a colorful and eye-popping battle royal style game that includes a multitude of different rounds to play - including solo race rounds, puzzle rounds, and skill based rounds. Team rounds are also a staple of the game play, pairing you up with random players in your lobby to work towards a common goal. However, there is only one crown, and therefore can only be one winner! In some cases there can be multiple winners, but for this to happen you have to have cooperation with the rest of the lobby and some skill in order to time out rounds.  The game play feels choppy at times, is the best way I can describe it. The crowd physics in the game, regarding interacting with other players through running into their character or grabbing them for different purposes, has from day one been an ongoing issue. While some games you can play with no issues and great server connection, other games will have you frustrated, especially in game modes requiring the grabbing aspect to either steal tails, hold Pegwins or trying to fight back against someone trying to grief you. I feel like it'll forever be an issue in the game, because the problem seems to be much deeper than just a simple patch can fix. I understand that this issue can be a deal breaker for new players, and I want to reiterate that it will become a problem for every player at some point.  For a game that looks colorful and fun and simple to play, there is a strong competitive player base that makes the games much more difficult for unsuspecting players. There are some people who will be able to pick up the game quickly and roll with the punches, but for most players there is a learning curve involved. I'm currently, as of this review, still under 600 crowns in total with 900 hours of playtime. I personally enjoy playing the game with friends, however, and spend a lot of time in game modes such as Squads Show and 2-3 man squads. This isn't a game that I think you can solely play competitively, and if you're going to continue coming back to the game you should find a way to have fun while playing! That can be any reason - grief other players, play with friends, or helping other players win. There's an amazing scene of streamers and players on Twitch that really got me hooked on the game, and I encourage anyone looking for other players to check out someone they like on that site! Personally I recommend DjBigRuss and CrazyyTrainn, but there are plenty of people to chat and play with!  Overall, it's a game - there will be plenty of people who enjoy it, and many others who dislike it. There's plenty of players online however, and finding a match doesn't take very long at all. With all the different levels and variations of those levels, along with an interactive media team and a development team that brings new content to the game as soon as they can. I recommend giving the game a chance at some point, if you're not willing to spend $20 for it then wait until it goes on sale. It's a wonderful game and I've met some wonderful people I don't think I would have met without this game, and it'll forever be a game that I have a ton of love for."

73778456,english,0,1097150,"Update 9.19.20 || The devs have addressed the cheating issue and have finally added EAC, which has helped to alleviate the cheating problem. I'm still going to leave this review as it was at the time that I wrote it to stand as testament to how terrible this game was on release.   I still don't recommend this game. I have zero faith in these developers. The anticheat took far longer than it should have to be added and all the other issues with this game still remain unaddressed.   PS, usernames are STILL disabled. I'm pretty confident the developers have no intention of re-enabling them. RIP grabbing ttv streamers, it was the only truly fun thing to do in this game.   //  This game's launch has been an absolute trainwreck.  THE GAME RUNS ENTIRELY CLIENT-SIDE, which means people can blatantly speedhack with no special hack tools. The game also has NO ANTI-CHEAT, AT ALL. The closest thing to anti-cheat is a single text channel in the game's official Discord where you can manually report cheaters, which, surprise, doesn't actually get any cheaters banned.   Users were able to use HTML in their Steam username to make their names appear large or colorful in-game. I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to ""Fall Guy ####"". WHY NOT JUST FIX THE HTML IN USER'S NAMES. Let me give your programmers a hint, it's called input sanitization, you can look up a tutorial for it on YouTube and actually do your job.  So with those two problems coupled together, yeah let me just go and file a report against someone with nothing but the username ""Fall Guy 1234"" to go on—I can't even track their Steam account through recent games. Keep in mind also that this game has a million-some players and there are only 4 digits in each randomized name, so there are going to be several dozen duplicates of each numerical name. The devs couldn't track that to a player even if they wanted to, so no one is getting banned for cheating. Great work guys. It's only going to get worse as the game goes on if nothing gets fixed.   This game has the worst netcode of any game I've ever played. There's a gamemode that involves running around the map and stealing tails from other players. This minigame was copy-pasted twice to make three equally garbage modes, I've heard dozens of complains against them from friends and streamers and I don't think a single person actually enjoys playing them. Enemies with Walmart parking lot tier internet can grab you from over 10 feet away and when you attempt to grab the tail off an enemy you can see the grab icon pop up on their character and nothing happens 50% of the time. It's so inconsistent that there's almost no skill here, just pure luck.   Nobody enjoys the forced team gamemodes either. You only have a small amount of control to the outcome of team games, so winning equates to a simple game of luck based on how bad your teammates are. In addition to that, this is a physics-based game, using Unity's default physics engine. It's horrifically inconsistent and sometimes your character will simply trip over their own feet, falling down and losing the game because someone grabs your tail while you're on the floor, or you jump down a level on Hex-a-gone and your character simply trips for no reason and you fall to your death while you try to stand up. The physics make the game feel horrible to play. Half of the minigames feel like they were quickly thrown together in the last 2 weeks of development to meet quota. Especially ""Perfect Match"", the game where no one ever dies unless they're literally afk.   Only *one day* after releasing, the game's servers completely died, for absolutely everyone, for almost an entire day. They had previously been dropping constantly in the middle of games. The devs' had presumably been attempting to migrate their servers to a different host with a larger capacity, but apparently failed to do so and were being very secretive as to why. They had announced a maintenance would begin at 6:00 am, but randomly decided to begin six hours early at peak player count time and gave no ETA for when it would be finished. The ""maintenance"" ended up taking almost the entire day and no one could play the game the entire time. When the game first officially released they deliberately avoided announcing the time that the game would unlock. They also avoided notifying players when the servers were back online after the ""maintanance"". They clearly knew the servers would choke on the first day and didn't fix the servers in the three day period before the game launched, or, you know, several months before, they had ample reason to predict this would be a problem but did nothing.    My favorite part of it all is that the developers are BLAMING THE PLAYERS for their problems. On Twitter they blamed the players when the servers went over capacity, clearly their fault, and they blamed the players when users used html in their names, also clearly their own fault. Fix your game.   The game has a separate Twitter account for the server status. Not only has the account constantly lied about the status of the servers, in addition to claiming they ""would tweet when the servers are back online"" and then didn't, I thought it was pretty hilarious that the main Twitter playfully posted something along the lines of ""Look how many people are following our server account!"". Yeah, no, they're not following that because they want to hear your awful hello-fellow-kids tweets, they're doing it because they want to know when the servers are going to be back online for the game they all paid $20 for.    The devs had MONTHS to beta test this game and somehow bafflingly didn't catch on to the fact that the servers wouldn't have enough capacity to handle the amount of players on launch. Or fix the broken netcode. Or add anticheat. Or fix html in usernames. Or rework the bad minigames. I refuse to believe this kind of stuff wasn't caught in QA, which means either there was no QA, or the devs just ignored the feedback.    I've never seen a company shoot themselves in the foot and handle success so poorly.  And to the people claiming that this is excusable because ""they're just a small indie company"", it isn't, because they're not. They have 230 employees and have existed since 2005. This is pure incompetence. I don't see this game lasting past its first season."
80884289,english,1,1097150,"I've had Fall Guys for a while now, and while the game now is merely a shadow of what it once was during it's first month of release, that doesn't take away from the fact that Fall Guys is a really great game to kill some time or play with friends. The gameplay is fun yet slightly challenging and the different courses are very reminiscent of those TV shows I used to watch as a kid. That said though there are a limited number of courses you can play through and though fun for a while they get old very fast, after about 2 hours I had seen every course in the game and after playing the same courses over and over again, sometimes back to back, it started to become a drag. All in all though I still recommend Fall Guys for when you have a few spare hours to burn or for when you're with your friends and wanna get a quick laugh."

78158202,english,0,1097150,"Fall Guys, as a concept, is a wondrous spin on the battle royale genre we’ve seen in recent years. My woes, however, stem from what I’m assuming is a dev team that’s trying their best with a playerbase they never expected.   Let me preface by saying that I am absolutely in love with this game, it’s probably one of my most favorites to come out in recent years. Solo matches are what I do to turn off my brain and relax for a bit. Playing with friends can lead to many laughs and wholehearted fun- but... only when it works. This is where my first problem stems:   Matchmaking into a game when queued with others on my friends list can be super dodgy. We get matched into different games from each other entirely, some of us just drop out of our team in the menu completely out of left field, or there will be a hard disconnect while we’re playing in an ongoing match. I do note, however, the disconnection issues have gotten better since one of their season 2 patches, so I thank them for that.  Another lingering issue I have is that ever since the mid-season update during the first season, one of my friends has been falsely flagged for cheating ever since EAC has been implemented. He has exhausted every option to get a concrete answer as to why they’ve been banned since then, only to be told that they -won’t- reverse it and won’t even tell him why he was banned in the first place. I KNOW he doesn’t cheat. This is the same EAC that’s used in games like Rust and Fortnite, and he can still play those games at full capacity.  No mention of what program it could’ve been, no real explanation... nothing. I’ve been unable to play with my friend for the longest time and it makes me both upset and sad that this is still going on. So... if you’re dealt a terrible card like he was, good luck! Because for some reason they won’t tell you why or how you got banned. That’s money down the drain. No chance at a refund if you’ve been playing for awhile.  My second most frustrating ordeals are when I see Mediatonic tout brand new variations for maps that a small group of players have said are too easy/boring when adding spinning pillars or hammers should be -last- on their list. Players being bored of a single two-minute match is a non-issue. Players can ABSOLUTELY handle a dry spell of the same map if it means that the devs could spend time and resources fixing prevalent bugs that have been in the game since day one.  Some bugs and issues I can remember off the top of my head:  - Broken hoops in the hoop games where you successfully jump in them and don’t earn a point  -Grabbing the crown in Fall Mountain only for the grab to not register at all, so you fall and someone else grabs the crown. Sometimes I would literally be dangling on the crown because I haven’t let go for a good few seconds in hopes that it will register my win, but then someone else runs in and gets the win instead  -Falling in-between the middle of three hexagons in Hex-a-Gone because the velocity messes with your bean, thus falling onto the levels below, or just getting eliminated immediately into the slime  -Jumping on a “crack” between two adjacent platforms in Jump Showdown and having my input get eaten, so my bean just simply doesn’t jump and I get swept away  -Minor (but annoying) issues like where my bean will be placed if I fall in a weird zone during one of the gauntlet levels (ex: in Whirlygig with the middle shortcut with the fan at the end, if you fall in a very particular place surrounding it, the game sets you up at the very BEGINNING of the map. So trigger zones or respawn placements really desparately need to be looked at.)  I don’t want to leave a negative review because I know game dev work is a lot. I’m leaving one (and hopefully, just for now) in the hopes that this gets read and passed along.   Your playerbase doesn’t need new big yeetuses, it needs answers and relief from some of the bugs that hinder the very core of your game on a near-daily basis.   Us players can wait for new mechanics and silly shenanigans, but everything I listed above is also just some of the several handfuls of bugs and problems I’ve encountered so far, and I know I’m not the only player with these issues. A quick look on the most popular Fall Guys subreddit will show you similar complaints, too.  I’ve amassed many hours into this game and probably over 90-100 wins currently, so know that my issues come from a place of wanting to see this game thrive. I adore Fall Guys, you have something lovely in your hands, so all I hope is that you devote some love back into the facets that need it most right now. As much as I want more people to get into this game, it’s hard to recommend it in its current state. While I may be patient with its many bugs and disconnects, there is also many others who will leave the game flat because of it.  You can do better, just by re-focusing on what’s important. I hope I can change my review in the future, but please, I hope this all gets heard. I wish Mediatonic the best of luck."

97365813,english,1,1097150,I have over 1300 hours on this game and it has given me the time of my life. I could never find a game that fitted me because ever other game in the world has complicated controls with 60 buttons. Fall Guys with 4 buttons is so incredibly simple and fun and made mine and so many others lives better in quarantine. Happy Birthday fall Guys!!
74006830,english,1,1097150,"There's no doubt Fall Guys deserves every ounce of the hype it's receiving - the game is ridiculously fun and an absolute blast to play alone or alongside a handful of friends, easily knocking Gang Beasts and similar titles off of their pedestals.  I trust Mediatonic will listen to the outcry for new levels, balancing, and content... but Fall Guys [b]will[/b] inevitably get repetitive and boring in the long run. For this reason, I encourage them to say attentive to community feedback and not fall into the void of trend-games; to do so, Fall Guys could follow in these three steps:   [b]Step One - Essentials[/b]  To begin, there's clearly a few minor issues with the game that most people are reporting across all platforms - notably regarding team games. Working together to complete objectives is fun, but individual skill currently holds no weight when qualifying for the next round.  Solving this is straightforward; team games should stay, but players may individually qualify throughout the round if they score enough points or hold the objective for enough seconds. Playing team games during a semi-final is very disappointing, since it's hard to shake the feeling that you may not qualify for the finals due to a rogue teammate.  Aside from team games, the majority of the minigames are hilarious, but I really hope that we don't have to wait for the end of the season for new maps. Seasons are around 60 days long which concerns me since there's a chance that we'll be in the same rotation of maps for another 2 months.   [b]Step Two - Update and Innovate[/b]  Undoubtedly, the most obvious way to maintain an active playerbase is to add new maps and skins, but this option can only be done so much before stagnating - I really want to see Fall Guys reaching the numbers it's doing right now around this time next year. To do this, Mediatonic need to be actively innovating and bringing in new features beyond the base game. Examples include:  [i]8-player Parties[/i]  Doubling the party size would be a great first non-map/non-cosmetic update - this currently being the main barrier holding back a few of my friends from buying, since our group cannot fit in a single party.  [i]New Moves[/i]  Controlling your Fall Guy is genius in its simplicity. Jumping, diving, and grabbing seem basic on the surface, but play a huge role in finding shortcuts, eliminating other players or getting a final boost of speed before reaching the finish line. However, as there are still many unused keys on both keyboard and controller, it'd be great to throw in an extra move or two.  One idea may be a high risk, yet high reward 'punt' button, allowing you to kick over a nearby opponent after a few seconds of charging up. However, missing a kick would cause your character to tumble forward, leaving them at risk to obstacles or other players.  [i]Weekly Event Days[/i]  Counter-Strike's War Games and Fortnite's LTM's opened up a new market for developers to satisfy niches in their audience, but tend to be stale and unexciting after a while.  Rather than sticking to the cookie-cut format of scattering limited-time modes throughout the year, Mediatonic could innovate by claiming a specific day of the week, introducing a unique spin on the entire game for 24 hours. '100-player Fridays' may be feasible; a once-a-week alternative to standard 60 player matches, containing exciting minigames tailored for larger groups alongside prodigious rewards for those who secure the crown. Providing the community with interesting spins on standard gameplay in small but addictive chunks may assist Fall Guys in moulding into [i]""that game we always play on Fridays""[/i], gradually shifting towards a lifestyle game that keeps people coming back to play week by week.  [i]Streamer Lobbies[/i]  Streamers will often return to games that enable them to play with their community, or host games such as 'Marbles On Stream' allowing active viewers to compete for personalised gifts such as a paid subscription, shout-out, or merchandise. With minimal crossover in this niche already, Fall Guys has an opportunity to grant streamers the ability to open a private lobby - rather than compete for crowns, viewers instead join through a room code and compete for a predetermined prize at the discretion of the streamer.   [b]Step Three - Sustaining Beyond 2020[/b]  With a mixture of luck and commitment, Fall Guys could become a smash hit, continuing to flourish over many years. Without getting too ahead of themselves, Mediatonic could consider opening their game up to the Steam workshop later down the line so players can upload their own maps and modes for approval. This way, Fall Guys is never short of quality content and unique ideas for the years to come!   To summarise, Fall Guys is awesome yet still has legroom to grow even bigger and better. In spite of expected day one issues, Fall Guys is far from being just another washed up gimmick, on the exception that Mediatonic really knuckle down on content and balancing [b]before[/b] the first season ends.  I strongly recommend Fall Guys and wish the very best for Mediatonic moving forward!"
77232547,english,0,1097150,"The updates are extremely slow and underwhelming, they hyped up season 2 so much and all they added was like a few new game modes and a couple changes to already existing maps.  Otherwise, the game is repetitive and gets boring really fast."

83890236,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a battle royale game where the player must guide their character through a series of events inspired by TV shows like Takeshi’s Castle or Ninja Warrior. Starting with 60 players in the match, roughly 10-15 players will be eliminated each round until the match ends with 1 winner.  There are lots of different events in the rotation so you won’t see the same ones in every match. Some events have players competing individually while others divide the players up into either 2 or 3 teams, with everybody on the losing team being eliminated.  Some events are races, where the player must jump over bottomless pits, avoid obstacles such as swinging axes, balls on chains and spinning blades, and cross the finish line as quickly as possible. In other events you have to score points by jumping through hoops, carrying eggs to a nest or pushing giant balls into goals. Or you might just need to stand on a platform while hazards try to knock you off. In some events, falling off the level will let you respawn at a checkpoint and try again, while in others, falling into slime results in instant elimination.  This is the first game I’ve played in the battle royale genre, and I’m enjoying the challenge of trying to get a win. I’d imagine most experienced gamers will find the first couple of rounds fairly easy to qualify from, but in the later rounds with only the best players remaining, it can be tough. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve finished in second or third place.  If you’ve watched your favourite streamer play Fall Guys (there was a time when pretty much everybody on Youtube was playing) and get annoyed by other players, I can confirm I know exactly how they feel. There’s nothing worse than somebody jumping into you just as you touch a bouncepad, causing you to fly off the level at a random angle, or when somebody grabs you for no reason (like, on a race event where they’ve got nothing to gain because it slows them down too), or when you dominate a team event but your team loses anyway. In most events though, its possible to recover from a couple of errors and still qualify, and being the last person to qualify for the next round feels great.  If you make it through to the final round, a complete match should take around 20 minutes to play. You’ll earn a couple of types of currency based on how far you survived, which lets you unlock some wacky cosmetic items. In 20 hours of gameplay I haven’t noticed any bugs. The physics sometimes feels a bit random but I think that is intentional because its a weird gameshow. Controls feel fine on my Xbox 360 controller. The art style is colourful and the music for most rounds is entertaining.  Fall Guys is a fun (and occasionally annoying) game to play if you’re looking for some wacky multiplayer action. Don’t let the art style fool you, it gets quite competitive in the later rounds. And there’s enough content and replayability to justify the price."
121547856,english,0,1097150,"I do not recommend this game after it was taken off the steam platform and put on Epic Games. It's turned into micro-transaction hell. It doesn't matter if you win anymore, so why keep playing?"
100479163,english,1,1097150,"[h1] Video Games [/h1]   While Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout isn't nearly as popular as it was around the time it launched, it still remains a perfect video game for what it sets out to accomplish. Its presentation, gameplay, low skill floor and price tag make it accessible to anyone who'd want to give it a try. If you're looking for something refreshing to play with a group of friends, even those who might not be big on video games, then look no further.   Gameplay-wise, it is the best Wipeout or Ninja Warrior game (n?)ever made. You know, those shows where people have to beat an obstacle course in order to win the prize money? Here it’s a bit different, with up to 60 players thrown into a match, consisting of several rounds. At the end of every round, those who fail to complete the objective in time are eliminated. Not every round is an obstacle course however, but can be anything from a vast plethora of minigames spread into six different categories.   For example, Race rounds will always task you with reaching the finish line of the course before a certain number of players manage to. Survival rounds will require you to not get eliminated before a certain number of players does, or a timer runs out. These are then further differentiated by themes and obstacles. One Survival round might have you balance atop of an ever-moving platform, dodging projectiles launched at you, while another will place you in an arena with three giant Rhinos attempting to knock you out. Team rounds, which require you to work with random players towards a common goal to prevent your entire team from being eliminated are all about scoring points, but can either be a game of basketball, football (the soccer kind) or collecting as high of a number of eggs as possible.   In the main game mode, a match must always start with a Race and end with a Finale – the most suspenseful, final round of the match, usually a Race that only one player can win or a Survival round that keeps going until the last man standing. Other game modes, both fixed and rotating, focus on specific categories or levels themselves. There are also custom matches you can make for you and your friends.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618963922  Even if all rounds across a category follow a certain pattern, none ultimately feel the same. Additional obstacles will sometimes appear on maps they were previously absent from, so the game can still throw you a curveball even when you think you have them all memorised.   Still, some are clearly better designed than others. Door Dash, a Race round, is a course consisting entirely out of doors. Some of these are openable, while the others aren’t – with there being no way of telling between the two until you try going through them. It almost completely eradicates the momentum of the match. If you go for an unlocked door consistently enough, you’ll qualify. If you don’t, tough luck. Other levels that solely consist of multitudes of the same obstacle have a similar effect, though none are as bad as Door Dash.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618967222  The controls are quite tight due to how limited they are. You can jump, grab (players, ledges, objects and some objectives) and dive, so the game requires a total of three buttons to play – excluding movement. A controller is ideal, but the keyboard and mouse perform almost just as well.  Progression feels good, but it could be better. Winning a round will net you a Crown, the game’s ’’premium’’ currency awarded solely through wins or milestones in the current Season’s battle pass-like progression, called Fame levels – limited to 50 per Season and increased by XP, which is awarded for each match you play. Each Crown you acquire also increases your overall player rank, which awards you cosmetics upon leveling up and is separate from your Fame level.   Besides Crowns, there are Kudos, a second currency awarded at certain Fame levels, as well as upon completion of a match regardless of whether you won or not. Kudos can also be purchased through microtransactions, in bundles as costly as $50, more than twice the game’s price. While the game isn’t by any means stingy with its rewards, the progression does feel a bit staggered and the inclusion of microtransactions can’t help but make me think of some marketing analyst or currency designer figuring out how to optimize it best to incentivise a purchase. Even when they aren’t intrusive, they’re there for a reason.  Your rewards can be spent in the store for cosmetic items. Some cost Kudos, some cost Crowns. There’s a fixed number of items that can be displayed in the store at a time and they reset once a day. Simple as. Customization options for your Fall Guy are quite varied and some visually striking combinations are possible, even without playing much.  Visually, the game is a colorful joy to look at, with the audio making it all the more appealing. The Fall Guys make cute ’’oofs“ and other sounds when they collide with each other, and scream of excitement when an obstacle launches them into the air – all of it heightened by a groovy, bass driven soundtrack. It just oozes fun.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618970077  Performance wise, the game ran great on max settings, at a steady 60 FPS. However, the animation LOD distance wasn’t that great, as players and obstacles further away would be running at a notably lower framerate. I don’t know if this is simply the way the game’s optimised, or something affected by the limitations of my specs. Weirdly enough, the game would sometimes drop down to 30 FPS while waiting in the lobby or the post-match recap.   Reviewed on the following system:  [table][tr][td]CPU [/td][td]AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6GHz[/td][/tr][tr][td]GPU[/td][td]GeForce GTX 1050Ti[/td][/tr][tr][td]RAM [/td][td]16GB[/td][/tr][/table]  While the game’s current player numbers are a far cry from what it once had, it still maintains a healthy population, both on Steam and outside of it, thanks to cross-play. I wholeheartedly hope that Mediatonic can keep Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout in such a state, as it’s a fun game that truly anyone can play. Even if you don’t end up winning, the little animation your Fall Guy does during the post-match summary shows that he’s had a lot of fun even participating, just as you will. Here’s to hoping it can keep going strong in the years to come, at least as long until there’s a worthy successor.

The winner is determined by 3 types of mini-games: race, survival and team. Each next task depends on how many players are still competing. You can run, jump, do a racing dive and grab - that´s it. As in real life everyone lives out their character. You will be pushed into the abyss, jostled, attacked by teams and finally mocked before the finish line. Please also welcome the fraudulent plague of the digital age that is literally flying over the cuckoo's nest. And ultimately the game physics, based on loss of movement control, ensures mass collisions and gives you the rest.  In a nutshell: 60 beans line up, one wins.  [h1]+/-[/h1]  + Takeshi´s Castle style + play with up to 3 friends + quick matchmaking + fast games - max 15-20 minutes to the crown I didn´t get once + rumbling jelly beans + hilarious fun and absurd situations + free season pass + customization - costumes, emotes, victory poses etc. + more hilarious fun and even more absurd situations + watch remaining players after reaching the finish line or even when you´re out  +/- easy to learn but(t) hard to master - did I mention I never got a single crown?!! +/- monetization for cosmetics and the game currency Kudos +/- your starting position can make the small but subtle difference, rotation makes it fair +/- after 1-2 hours you know all mini-games, but more are announced  - There´s nothing really negative to say about Fall Guys. Yes, there are cheaters, but show me a multiplayer game where these dishonorable beings don´t show up. And yes, the unexpected success of Fall Guys initially completely overwhelmed the servers and you still may experience a disconnect or lag here and there. So what, go for the next round. Unfortunately there is a trend for negativity in reviews and forums these days because people have neither understanding nor patience anymore. And in the end all depends on how developers communicate with their player base and solve problems. They did a great job so far and seem to really care about their game.  [h1]Is Fall Guys worth your time and money?[/h1]  Absolutely! It´s screamingly funny and the first so-called Battle Royale that I enjoy. No ranking lists, no weapons to master and in lack of a chat no russian pet names for your mother. Fall Guys definitely is the multiplayer feast of this summer that nobody expected. So join the party or be a party pooper."

I certainly wasn't expecting to relive that fantasy while playing as a jelly bean but alas here I am.  The premise is simple, race and fight your way to victory in order to retrieve the crown.

Most of them don't have clear descriptions or instructions on their loading screens. Is this a race? survival? You don't know until you figure it out live in the game. [*]The quality of these maps vary widely. [*]Many of them don't follow design principles and can't be sight read. Falling feels more like a ""gotcha!"" moment than actual failure. [*]The starting groups are now smaller so winning doesn't have as much impact. [/list]  The only good thing I saw was that there is a faster transition between games.  They need to bring back the old choices and let players choose to play creative maps or standard. What would really make this game shine again is bringing back all the old maps they've removed over the years in an ""everything goes"" mode."

It's a cute battle royale which I haven't had the pleasure of playing since Mario Party or something like that.  Every woman, man and his dog already knows about Fall Guys so let's just get down to brass tacks.  __________________  [h1] PROS [/h1]  +  Fun with a capital F.  Everything is colourful and playful and when I played each time the servers were pretty fast.    +  room for improvement.  We are in season 1 now and I hope that next seasons come with new maps.  There is a huge window of opportunity to keep the game fresh and therefore the play-count high.  The devs are going to have to really focus on this aspect because at 60 players per room, that's a helluva goal to set to keep this game alive.  But to be fair when you have a bunch of seasons of Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle to draw from for inspiration then we are all set for a few years I think.  +  maps.  There are a lot of maps but I haven't experienced them all yet in my 4 hours.  Some are better than others but everyone will have their own preferences.  Some maps are hectic scrums, others require a bit more platforming savvy techniques, others yet have a more physical dexterity aspect.  There is something for everyone.  +  microtransactions are purely cosmetic and offer no bonuses to the players.  There are a bunch of skins you can buy or grind out using the in-game currency, Kudos.  But there is nothing I can see that offers a speed or jumping bonus, etc.  Just MTX to keep funding the game once saturation of the player base has been reached, I suppose.  -------------------------  [h1] CONS [/h1]  -  names.  EVERYONE has a username of fallguy XXXX where X=numbers.  I want to put my own name in there.  I want to see my friends I am playing with.  I want to know that b'stard that pushed me off a ledge.    -  controls.  The controls seem a bit too sluggish for me.  Changing direction or trying to grab something can feel like you are doing it through a pool of syrup.  -  hackers ruin everything.  I have only seen a couple but they are out there and they are x10 faster than us, they begin before the starting gun fires, they jump higher and further than us and it is zero fun watching them take the crown.  -------------------------  Fall Guys is a blast.

118666489,english,0,1097150,"I remember when I bought this game in 2021. A key part of that memory involves the fact that, at that time, I was actually able to, you know, play the game. (For a few hours. I think I snagged it during a sale, tried it out for a bit, and then planned on playing it more substantially later.)  Now. in 2022, I attempt to start the game up. I discover that there are now about 10 layers of Epic Games garbage retrofitted to the game; and so in addition to taking forever to launch, it never gets past the very first ""Loading"" screen. I literally can't even make it to the main menu. I've done all the usual troubleshooting steps, and nothing works. [b]It's just completely effing broken.[/b]  Add to that the various other controversial changes apparently done to the game in the time since the developers/publishers sold their souls to Epic Games (these changes are well-documented by others), and the only message I can reasonably say I'm getting from the people behind this game is a giant middle finger.  I'm currently attempting to get a refund, since I bought the game under a particular understanding, and the game has been completely changed in such a way that it no longer reflects the buying decision I originally made at all. (For example: when I bought it, I did so on the understanding that I would be able to, like, you know, [b]play the game[/b], or at least even get to the main menu. And while this was possible at the time I paid for the game, it's no longer possible. Not being able to play the game is one fairly significant factor that would generally tend to make me not want to spend money on a game and buy it.)  [b]If the developers/publishers are going to take away my ability to play the game I paid for, then I think it's only fair that I be allowed to take away the money that I gave them, in good faith, on the understanding that I'd be able to effing play the damn thing in the first place.[/b]  [b]UPDATE:[/b]  For anyone who runs into the same problem I did: After an inane amount of time wasted troubleshooting this stupid problem, I have concluded that the infinite loading screen is, in fact, actually just Epic Games's intuitive way of informing you that you need to link your Epic Games account to your Steam account in order for the game to load. Their game overlay system is apparently broken or fucked or whatever, and so it just doesn't bother to show up and inform you of what the hell you need to actually do. This is genius-level game design. Also, if you weren't able to figure out that ""infinite loading screen means I need to link my accounts"", then you are probably an idiot who will be yelled at by other, definitely much smarter, people for not being able to figure out such an obvious thing yourself.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840429916"
79725349,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout is one of the most popular of this year, so let's take a look at this Takeshi Castle inspired game. Since there's no story, let's jump into graphics.   Graphics:  Fall Guys has an absolutely amazing art style. The world is bright and colorful and the bean people you control are absolutely adorable. You can also buy different costumes and outfit your bean with the style that suits you the best. There will be that one costume that you will definitely want to save up for and bring into every game you go into.   The bright and colorful look of the world is an absolute joy. Everything is splattered with bright colors like pink, blue, yellow and others, it honestly reminded me of cartoons I would watch as a kid. The game is really pleasant to the eye and for that I got to give major props to the designers.   Audio:  The music of Fall Guys has no reason to be as good as it is. Most of the tracks are insanely catchy, especially the final round music which is by far the best track in the game. Most of the other ones are also really good and honestly I loved most of the tracks in the game.  One other thing is the sound effects. First of all, I got to admit that the sounds the beans make when expressing joy, sadness and when something happens when they bump into something or fall are incredibly adorable. That's the one thing that I never get sick of when playing the game.  Also the beans themselves look mushy and the sounds they make when bumping into things is oddly satisfying. Overall I think the audio design and it's a definite highlight of the game, especially the incredibly catchy soundtrack.  Gameplay:  Ever watched Takeshi's Castle ? Wipeout ? Well imagine if Fall Guys is the video game adaption of those two shows. The game is basically a battle royale where you go through obstacle courses until you're the last man standing. So let's talk about the meat and potatoes of the game, which is the courses.  There's a good variety of courses in the game, ranging from races, team games and survival games. Race courses are courses where you race to the finish line, while avoiding obstacles. Team games are usually objective games where you team up with other players to compete against other teams and lastly survival games where you avoid stuff trying to survive until enough players are eliminated.   The good majority of the courses are really well designed and fun to play, they rely on your skill and when you have one very clean run avoiding everything and coming out at the front is so satisfying, however a good majority of the courses are incredibly poorly designed.   First of all there's a few courses in the game where a few players have to sacrifice themselves so other players can win. This is mostly a problem in Tip Toe and Wall Guys, where a couple of players have to set up a path for the other players to follow, which will definitely mean they will lose.  Not to mention See Saw, where players will refuse to stand on one side because that will put them behind other players.  But those usually have nothing on the team games. Pretty much all of these are incredibly poorly designed. These game modes never rely on your skill, but the skill of the players that are assigned to your team. You might get unlucky and get players that leave that one course they simply hate and would rather just get into another game, or as soon as you're one point behind, they will start trolling. Most of these are incredibly tedious and when I get a team game,  I find the experience more tedious than fun.   Once enough players are eliminated you go into the finale. There's currently four different finales and honestly these are a mixed bag. The most poorly designed is Fall Mountain. This is a course where you race to the top of a mountain to grab a crown and this is a course that is purely dependent on the RNG of the game. If there's enough players for three rows, if you're in row three, you can basically give up before the game even begins.   Another one that I find incredibly stupid is Jump Showdown. In this one you're on platforms avoiding a pillar that keeps spinning, trying to knock you off, until there's only one man left standing. In this one the platforms keep falling off and there is a high possibility you can get stuck on a side that will lose all platforms with no way to recover. But if you do find yourself on the last few platforms left standing, then it's purely skill that can get you the win.   Also each course has different variations with different obstacles   Even with these negatives, I found the game a ton of fun and most of the courses incredibly fun, hopefully the bad ones get taken out of the game and reworked or the just vaulted entirely and I really want more skill based finales.   Verdict:  Fall Guys is a ton of fun and honestly even with it's issues I had an absolute blast going through the crazy courses, racing other players and getting that sweet sweet crown. Overall for the price you get a really solid multiplayer experience, which could last you countless hours. If you're looking for something bright to cheer you up in dark times, Fall Guys is definitely the game to go with.   Final Rating: 9/10  Pros: + Most courses are incredibly fun to go through + Bright and cute art style is pleasing to the eye + Amazing score   Cons: - Tons of courses depend on luck, rather than skill - Team games  If you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews"

73803912,english,0,1097150,"I'll start off with saying this is FAR from a bad game, and definitely has potential to be a great and fun experience, but right now it just has some glaring issues that really put me off from playing more than just a few games, I heavily encourage you to look up more reviews and gameplay to decide if it's something for you but here's what nags me personally;  [h1]Repetitiveness[/h1] Right now it's difficult for me to really keep going as you keep seeing the same maps over and over in just a few hours of playtime, and most of these involve running forward from one end to the other before X amount of players do, with the inspiration this game draws from Takeshi's Castle this is understandable, but I feel like more could be done in this regard to make the average game more varied.  [h1]Team games feel awful[/h1] Generally I enjoy the game in short bursts, but I have absolutely never enjoyed any of the team games, it honestly just feels like a 2 minute wait to roll your 66% or 50% chance to not be eliminated, this isn't helped by the fact teams can be uneven in terms of player numbers and objectives spawning at random in some of these minigames, I really wish there was an option to opt out of these.  [h1]Winning as a currency[/h1] This is entirely subjective, but I hate this, of course there's skill involved but winning is mostly a random ordeal from my experience, yet there's time-limited cosmetics you can only obtain by winning 10 or so games, quickly shifting the focus from lighthearted fun to just getting annoyed if you don't get the crown should you be interested in any of those cosmetics. I really wish there was no arbitrary time limit on these things or another way to get the currency so you can steadily progress, the pressure to win is something I don't enjoy in a casual party game, of course reward the winner but please don't lock things solely behind winning games.  [h1]Final rounds are very discouraging.[/h1] Currently there are 3 minigames for the final round to decide the winner, two of these feel utterly pointless to me as one of them is a race, but you spawn in 2 rows, if you don't spawn in the first row you've generally lost from the second it starts. The other game involves holding an item when a timer runs out, which generally just results in running in a circle for 2 minutes, only to end up in a clump of people for the last few seconds, mashing the grab button and praying you have the thing when the clock runs out, which is more frustrating than anything. The third game is one I actually enjoy where you need to move across disappearing platforms in multiple layers to avoid falling down, the last one standing wins, this doesn't feel as random or reliant on luck and makes for a much more fun experience, I hope more final minigames follow this trend.   All that said, I'm still excited to see where this game goes, as new maps and minigames are already planned, and I'm already very close to recommending the game."
73975501,english,1,1097150,"There is just something about running head first into doors as a cute bean in a raptor outfit, 60 people bumping into each other, sounds of hitting squeaky toys all around, that is very repetitive, but makes you want to keep coming back everytime."

The devs have always taken questionable paths regarding level rotation and game updates in general, but since the Epic takeover this game has dropped into the bin.   Same maps day in day out, bearing in mind there are around 100 potential levels to choose from, yet hardly ever get to play them (some of which seem to have been permanently discarded).  Mundane season changes which again force monotonous rotation ad nauseum.  Terrible take over by EpicGames which means frequently you can't even play the game when the servers are down, and also a freemium content model which removes the ability to earn anything worthwhile in the game such as  new costumes, as these have become accessible only for real money.

84528738,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Fall Guys[/h1] With a massive cheating problem the first half of the 1st season it was pretty much unwinnable. After upgrading their anti-cheat it became much more enjoyable as you could win a few games. Sadly with that rough start and to slow content additions (if any at first), a lot of players left the game. It is the main problem with a game like Fall Guys, it gets old playing the same maps constantly. Season 2 had mediocre content, but Season 3 is by far the best season so far seen to content.  Fall Guys also suffers a lot from haters and labeling. The game is not Dead by any means and it people still spam and try to massively downplay the game, a lto havent even tried it... As goes with the labeling it isnt a casual game at all. Play with your little children and they will most likely fail to qualify from the first round and a lot of players statistically havent even won a full episode once. While skill is needed, it is very RNG dependant. To make it even worse there is a clear adv/disadvantage between players. Players are not affected by collision, grabbing and phisics equally. This explains why so few have less than 20 wins. The game greatly rewards skilled players, especially those with advantage. Notice that golden person that is ungrabbable, that can walk into you moving you a long while if you do it you wont move them an inch. Do you fall more often and take much longer to get up? Just watch a top player stream and compare your game, I can say mine isnt the same as theirs...  So to summerize some things the game has a good community, lots of haters and heavily rewards the top 1% of the game, it is probably fun for most people for a while, but many wont last even 5-10 hours. Since they have episode varriations now I mostly play when good structured ones appear like the recent Hex-a-gone only one so I dont get bored.  Ignoring bad phisics, adv/dis etc. the game suffers from some other problems aswell. For instance some people have a lot of disconnects and team games suffer from balancing when te teams are uneven. If your side is losing you dont get punished at all from leaving early and solidifying a loss for the team, 3 team games many teams end by simply having 2 teams gang up against one team which the game has no mechanics to balance against. Lastly, for some reason they have an achievement for winning 5 episodes in a row. Devs WTF, are you serious? Disconnects break the streak aswell and early people used exploit to get it by leaving if they werent sure they would win to keep the streak...  In conclusion the game is fun, for a while but grows old rather quicky. It doesnt take that long to finish the season pass and has been easier with each season. Better players with not too much disadv get waaay more rewarded than other player with much higher playtimes and can usuallly buy everything constantly in the shop (cosmetics).  I recommend Fall Guys since it provides a good amount of fun and suits a lot of different people. I hope they further balance the game between bad and good players, it doesnt really make much sense pitting the best against the worst in a battle royal and denying many players the ability to get a single win. The biggest issue of being vastly unfair between players hopefully will get smaller as they keep optimizing and polishing the game.  //ECE//"

Removing the game from the Steam store was a horrible idea as well, even though there are more than 100k reviews (mostly positive).

Epic Games recently bought Fall Guys and that's a good move for reviving this game again. I think with this will come new content more often. My opinion is that If two more seasons will come with equally well-crafted maps as in this season, Fall Guys will be one of the best games which you can play to chill with your friends."

75936183,english,1,1097150,"Fall guys is super funny to play, and what's most ironic is that the chaos in game is also a funny part! For some reason this game reminds me of that old japanese TV show 'Takeshi's castle' where also, 50 or more competitors, have to go through a series of obstacle parcours and who makes it to the finale can play the finale.  Only difference was that all competitors didn't had to go through the obstacle parcours all at once, and this is what this game makes so much fun,  Imagine 60 players all together trying to be the first to squeese through a moving door, or how you will always fail to balance a platform to move to the next. Every obstacle parcour or level task in this game is worth to play it, even losing is fun.

I re-installed the game half a dozen times and verified the integrity of my game files even moreso. The servers are completely online, and when I play with friends, I prevent my whole team from being able to enter a match. I can connect to other games that use EAC, and I've tried every other day since the mid season patch to no avail.

74881907,english,1,1097150,"Have you ever wondered what shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle would look like in Video Game form? Say hello to Fall Guys since that’s essentially what it is, and boy is it fun.  [h1]What I like:[/h1]  + Fall Guys has a wide variety of games that provide their own set of challenges. They’re not all brilliant, but they stand out and are entertaining. Some people say there aren’t enough games, but personally I think there’s enough to justify the price.  + Fall Guys isn’t a complex game. Each level has a simple goal, whether it being to jump over obstacles or bash through the right door and reach the finish line. The overall objective is to qualify each round until you reach the final round for the ultimate victory. Given time, anyone can pick this up and eventually win a game.     + The game has a colourful art style that is very effective at luring people in and hiding how frustrating the game can be. The visual design of the levels, although simple, is nice to look at, and the character designs are iconic.   + The game is challenging. Fall Guys will inevitably get you angry at some point, whether it’ll be because of the wacky physics or somebody getting in the way. It’s both the silliness and the competitiveness that make this game really fun to play.  + As well as being challenging, it’s also addicting. Sure, it doesn’t take long to end up playing the same games again and again but that didn’t bother me much because each round felt different. It’s all dependant on who you’re put up against.   + There is a vast amount of customisation items for your character, ranging from colours, patterns and outfits. The devs regularly introduce cross over events with other games. At the time of writing, they have done TF2, Portal 2 and Enter the Gungeon. There is also a free battle pass that gives you cosmetics as you progress.          [h1]What I don’t like:[/h1]  - Team games are definitely hit or miss. Sometimes they’re great. Sometimes they’re awful. The problem is that people leave as soon as their team is losing, screwing over the people who are trying. I don’t mind team games, but it would be nice if there could be two types of match searches; one type being solo games only, and the other being a mix of the two.  - I can’t say I like the tail games. The hitboxes for them seem really inconsistent. There were times where I should’ve grabbed the tail but the game failed to detect it. That or I’m just really bad. It could be that.  - Although not as bad as they used to be, server issues are still prevalent. Disconnects and lag spikes will happen every so often. Speed hackers and cheaters are also a problem. Yes people hack in this game, it's incredible really.   [h1]My Overall Thoughts:[/h1]  Fall Guys has become insanely popular since release and I can understand why. It’s a unique take on a battle royale that manages to make the genre enjoyable to people who despise it. The fact that it still has a massive playerbase shows that the devs did many things right.  As I mentioned before, it’s the silliness and competitiveness in each round that make this game enjoyable and memorable. It’s meant to be frustrating. It’s meant to be over the top. And it’s really damn fun. The game has a charm that I personally haven’t seen much of in multiplayer games.  That being said, the game is far from perfect. Fall Guys had a rough launch server wise and still has a way to go. It also has a hacker problem which is in the process of being fixed. The game still needs some new features such as advanced searches as well as tweaks to already existing game modes.   Fall Guys isn’t necessarily a game you will play for a prolonged period of time, but it’s a brilliant pick if you want something to spend the time. It’s great on your own and it’s great with friends, and with its current price tag, I’d say it’s worth it.

96308081,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is one of the most enjoyable online gaming experiences. With simple controls, heaps of fun, replayable mini-games and customizations (paid or won) that do not alter the gameplay, and a catchy background tune, Fall Guys has everything that causes addictive play. Indeed, even when you are eliminated, there is the immediate urge to hop back in and try your luck again. The only thing that lets Fall Guys down is the inability to play local matches against friends on your couch. The vibrant levels, with their inflatable-like obstacles and moving platforms wouldn’t be out of place on a TV game show. Indeed, I’m now looking forward to the Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout TV adaption, where players must don Fall Guy suits and compete in a similar series of wacky and enjoyable events. Until then, Fall Guys will be my multiplayer game of choice."
92550457,english,1,1097150,"If you asked me if I'd recommend this game when it first came out, I'd say no. Back then, it was pretty much the same 10 minigames over and over, which got boring REALLY fast.   But now, as of the time I'm writing this (season 4.5) there are 46 different minigames, and that number doesn't include the fact that many minigames have random variations that might change up the game significantly, so really the amount of UNIQUE minigames is probably up in the hundreds. Now I can play for an hour and barely see any repeat minigames, which was basically impossible when this game first launched.   TL:DR The game used to be boring, but now it isn't since the devs added (and are continuing to add) a bunch of new minigames which helps keep it fresh.  Plus the music has no right being that good"
79841325,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” burst onto the gaming scene with a splash in August 2020, capturing the hearts of players with its unique blend of chaotic fun and colorful, whimsical aesthetics. Developed by Mediatonic, this battle royale-style party game quickly became a cultural phenomenon, celebrated for its vibrant graphics, quirky challenges, and family-friendly appeal. Unfortunately, despite its initial success, “Fall Guys” is no longer available on Steam, leaving many fans longing for its return on the platform.[/b]  [h1]Gameplay and Appeal[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” offers a delightful twist on the battle royale genre, replacing the intense combat with a series of absurdly fun mini-games and obstacle courses. Players control customizable jellybean-like characters as they navigate through increasingly difficult rounds, all while avoiding elimination. The game's charm lies in its accessibility; anyone can pick up and play, making it a great choice for both casual gamers and those seeking a lighthearted competitive experience.  The vibrant, cartoonish art style and upbeat soundtrack create an inviting atmosphere, enhancing the enjoyment of its frenetic gameplay. Each round is a chaotic spectacle, where strategy and timing blend with a healthy dose of luck. Whether you're dodging swinging hammers or leaping across precarious platforms, the sheer unpredictability of each match ensures that no two games are ever the same.[/b]  [h1]The Hype[/h1]  [b]At launch, “Fall Guys” was met with widespread enthusiasm and quickly garnered a dedicated player base. Its appeal was amplified by its engaging, easy-to-learn gameplay and the ability to play with friends, which made it a popular choice for streamers and content creators. The game's success was further fueled by regular updates, seasonal events, and collaborations with various franchises, which kept the content fresh and exciting.[/b]  [h1]The Downfall[/h1]  [b]Despite its early success, “Fall Guys” faced significant challenges over time. One of the major issues was the server instability and connectivity problems that plagued players, particularly during peak times or after major updates. These technical difficulties detracted from the overall experience and led to frustration among the player base.  More critically, the decision to remove “Fall Guys” from Steam was a disappointing turn for many. The game transitioned to a free-to-play model and launched on other platforms, including Epic Games Store, which led to its withdrawal from Steam. This shift was met with mixed reactions, as it left a portion of the community unable to access the game through their preferred platform.  The transition also meant that future updates and new content were no longer available to Steam users, diminishing the game's visibility and impact on the platform. While the game’s cross-platform functionality ensured that players on other platforms could still enjoy it, the Steam community was left feeling somewhat abandoned.[/b]  [h1]Conclusion[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” remains a memorable entry in the gaming landscape, celebrated for its whimsical charm and engaging gameplay. While the decision to remove the game from Steam was a blow to many fans, the game's legacy endures through its continued presence on other platforms and the fond memories it created during its peak.[/b]  [i]The game’s hype was well-deserved, as it brought a fresh and entertaining twist to the battle royale genre. However, the challenges it faced, particularly the platform transition and technical issues, highlight the difficulties of maintaining momentum in a highly competitive market. For those who experienced its glory days on Steam, “Fall Guys” will always be a beloved reminder of the fun and chaos of its unique gameplay.[/i]"
79018450,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys is really fun! I've just picked up the game a few months after release, and while there was a stumbling block in doing well due to the skill of other players (and the fact that I suck at video games in general), I've managed to make it pretty far and have a lot of fun. Don't believe anyone who says this game is dying! It may not be meme-level status anymore but it's still very fun and has lots of players."

I keep getting disconnected from servers and I face with heavy desyncs. Also, server availability for asia in general is really bad. at around 1:30am my time, the matchmaking goes into forever loop and I can't find anyone.

Even as a new player, after a few games you will be repeating events, after about 10 games you will have experienced everything this game has to offer. - Starts to feel a bit repetitive after about 1 hour (in my experience) - In-game cash shop   Overall, is it fun? Yes, for a limited short time.  With the current amount of content available within Fall Guys, I would have priced this game at around $5.  If they decide to add (A LOT) more content later on, than perhaps this game is justifiable at $20, but currently I wouldn't imagine playing Fall Guys for more than about 2 hours.   *Voted Positive, because the game is truly fun, and I don't want to bash it just for the price*"
94862122,english,0,1097150,"This is a hard review to make as I have a mixed feeling about the game overall. I've stuck with it ever since Season 1 and never really stopped playing it except for Season 3. You could say I just really, really want the game of this type to succeed.  What pulls me in is the unique [strike]tournament style[/strike] battle royale gameplay you have. It's just a bunch of minigames (47 as of writing of this) that you face randomly. The pull of this game for me is that you can play solo, that it's a platformer-ish BR and that it creates unique combos of levels every match. The first few rounds are often easy, not punishing and include quite a bit of random. For example - Door Dash is pretty much RNG - you slam against doors and hope they're not fake. Pretty RNG if you ask me, but it only spawns with at least 40 players, which you are very likely not to be at after round 2. On the other hard, the finals are supposed to be hard, skill-testing experiences, because only one winner emerges and that winner wins the whole show.  The problems arise when you actually take more than 2 seconds to look at the game. Back when this game first released, PC had a massive cheater problem which persisted for ~40 days until they finally released a mid-season patch. At that point most mainstream players weren't even playing anymore. This is an example of how horrible Mediatonic (the devs) are at game polish. This game has had constant polish issues. Season 4's release was a bugfest - they introduced the new Squads Show (which I liked), but it was very buggy - almost as if the devs never even tested it, or tested it with such strange priorities, that they only ever cared about fixing the game-breaking bugs. Speaking of priorities, I find Mediatonic a strange outlier in this category as well - most developers, for example, Mojang with Minecraft, push out multiple bug fix updates after their newest release to make sure that players have the least buggy experience before starting work on new features. That's not how it works for Mediatonic! Every season, they appear to have this cycle: * Season drops - new features, meaning new bugs * One hotfix a few days later or a week later (at least the one that the community gets notified about) * A lot of time passes * Mid-season patch - fixes bugs AND adds new features (new bugs) * More time passes * Repeat I assume Mediatonic is on a time crunch or something, because they are trying to dish out new features as quickly as possible...  Asides from polish, the design of the game is questionable as well. The most distinct and unique features of Fall Guys is what you play as - you play as beans which are designed with kinda strange physics. They can fall over, get hit, stretch (visually) and flip over... but they can also get flung or... just act strange and unpredictable. Fall Guys doesn't offer solid server sync. I've never seen myself get teleported or re-synced with the server somehow - the server doesn't control any of that. What this means is Fall Guys has one of the worst desync I've seen of all games. You can be sure that most of the players you see on your screen are actually at least a bit ahead. Near the end of races, I often see players disappear off the map BEFORE they cross the line. The problem with this is when you play tail tag games and Jinxed, where the game OBJECTIVE, depends on something that's desynced... Luckily it's usually not THAT bad. I pretty much never had strong issues with Tail Tag, Royal Fumble and games like that. What's more annoying is the more prevalent mechanic - GRABBING. Grabbing is the strongest mechanic when it comes to interacting with players. What's annoying about it, is that you can get grabbed by a desynced player who looks like he's really behind you (on whose screen you're closer to them). When that happens, you will literally get flung backwards against your win and then stuck for a bit... It's also annoying because the duration for which you get stuck appears to be random. Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's long. Also, if you are the one to grab a player, you also kind of get stuck. It's annoying because when you stop holding the key to grab, there's a noticeable delay to get unstuck from the grabbing position. This is a flimsy mechanic that is now integral to the game, giving the game it's own 'feel', which really sucks, because it's often frustrating to many players and is the main way to grief other players. I get that there needs to be a way to interact with others, but I really wish it was less annoying than that. There are even more issues with desync, but I don't think Steam can handle my review to be much longer....  I know I've said that Fall Guys seems to pertain a pattern where the first rounds are easy and kinda random, while last rounds require skill, but really isn't the reality - it's just a pattern people WANT to see. There are currently 6 finals in the game. The final that requires the most skill is Jump Showdown, but on paper it sounds really boring - it's just a final version of Jump Club with a top and bottom 2-sided baton, where the bottom baton speeds up over 5 minutes that the round lasts. The only other thing about the final that is unique, is that its floor divided into 8 parts is slowly destroyed down to 2, limiting your running space (and introducing unfair RNG that is STILL not fixed!). That sounds boring... but unfortunately simple rounds are like that are somewhat common in Fall Guys (which in my opinion isn't an issue that much). What's the issue are the other finals. I don't have strong issues with Royal Fumble, though people considered it the worst final. My issue is with finals like Fall Mountain or as I like to call it ""RNG Mountain"". The game is a climb upwards with very unpredictable elements determined by RNG. Due to lack of autonomy over your characters, it's often impossible to dodge or gain a benefit from oncoming projectiles. In my opinion this was the worst final until Season 4.5, where they managed to outdo themselves somehow. Mediatonic, on a quest to add more variations, decided to add low gravity to (the overrated) Hex-A-Gone and Thin Ice... this turned them into the most boring finals ever. Because everyone has very large jumping range and all of it is very slow, it becomes child's play until the final moment of the final. At that final moment, the only thing that impacts the result is who jumps LAST and spends the most time midair. That's the winner! That's it! Who thought this was a good idea? I understand the will to add more variations, but there are so many better ways to do it! How about you change the positions of hexes? How about you make interesting layers out of them??? Or what about making special new types of hexes that do something? There are so many things you could do but you didn't bother... What's also upsetting is the choice of what Mediatonic chooses to even add in each season. Consider the fact that every single season since release had ALWAYS added new Team games... you know, the game archetype that MOST players hate??? From noobs to pros, most HATE Team games. They are only good in Squads Shows imo. Team is arguably one of the biggest archetypes in the game with most rounds, while also being the most hated type of game. Season 3 is the only season to have added new Finals. What's upsetting is that these 'new' Finals are just Final reskins of already existing games! They added Roll Off, which is the final version of Roll Out and they added Thin Ice, a more boring variation of Hex-A-Gone... That's how creative they are despite the constant streams of suggestions they opened up for themselves, they couldn't come up with anything more original.  I'll end this review here for now. There are more issues with the game, like the controversies Mediatonic had with exclusive skins, worrying monetization and Mediatonic's belligerence with trackers. I still like the game and really wish it improved... 6/10"

80550533,english,1,1097150,"Look here me out, This game is a masterpiece as it allows for casual players to have fun, but also rewards more competitive gamers with the allure of a battle royale. It can seem repetitive to some people but the silliness of it all keeps you hooked. Some people may get frustrated by the randomness of certain rounds (team battles) but it is easy to jump back in and try again. The microtransactions aren't intrusive and are very rewarding for low prices, so people who are willing to spend can get the best value out of it. The battle pass is even free!

I think the graphics are neat, and you can have some funny costumes for your bean; all the while listening to a soundtrack that just fits.

87075938,english,0,1097150,"This is a good game to play with a group of 3 other friends, and it's can be a good game for children.  Other than that, this game was Game of The Month in August of 2020.  Sadly, Fall Guys gets very repetitive, as the algorithm that decides which level you play will often give you the same levels over and over again. Not to mention if you are playing the game by yourself, it can be very frustrating as every player(as well as the level) is working against you, and no one is working with you.  There was a time during season 1 when Fall Guys actually favored those who were skilled at the game. Sadly they eventually started changing it so that there were so many obstacles that skill no longer will help you much with winning as it once did. And even when there weren't so many obstacles to get in your way, there used to be hackers in season one to keep you from winning. Apparently Mediatonic thought it was fine to replace hackers with moving obstacles to keep this game from being at all skill based when it comes to winning. This is one of the few games that I know of where you can get good at the game and never win a crown by actually winning. I know so many people who have played this game, only to get second place, and never first.  Honestly, the most disappointing part of Fall Guys isn't even anything I just listed. The most disappointing part of it, that I find, is that at most, there are only 2 game modes at any given time. I remember how when everyone I knew was playing this game would talk about how awesome it would be if at least streamers could organize their own games with 60 or less players from their chats. Sadly, this game doesn't get much added to it, other than skins. Yeah, there are just a few new levels every season, but not much changes about this game, as it is largely luck based and is a waste of time for players like myself.  All in all, this game was over-hyped and likely will not stand the test of time. I don't recommend it to anyone looking for a good game, unless they like repetitiveness."
107946780,english,0,1097150,"If you want to get into this game, I recommend looking into some of these features within the game before making your judgement. This post will be a cumulative list of the worst of Fall Guys, and will go on for a while, so be warned.  Going into this list, I want you to keep two key facts in mind. Number one, take into consideration this quote, in its absolution, no edits, no paraphrasing, from the March 2nd, 2021 official Mediatonic release about their acquisition by Epic Games:  [quote=Mediatonic]""Joining forces with Epic will accelerate our plans to improve the game and bring Fall Guys to as many players as possible, while continuing to support the community.""[/quote]  Second, consider the fact that most, if not all, of the clips I will be sharing were delivered [b]on level release[/b]. Some of these features date back to the game's early months. I want you to consider this: an error in the game that lasts a couple of weeks is a bug, a hitch in the experience. If that issue persists into month durations, that's no longer a bug. That's the experience the developers want you to be having while playing this game.  These are the types of experiences that the developers have left unchecked for several months, and thus, want you to be experiencing by buying this game.

Improving the game, and supporting the community. Allowing players to experience the true, undeterred Fall Guys experience that Mediatonic wants you to experience when you play the game.   I ask you, though. Surely if these were to be considered bugs and glitches, then Mediatonic would absolutely take time to remedy these issues, and if these were issues to begin with, then keeping them within the game for several months and counting means that the community is [i]wrong[/i], and these are indeed the improvements promised to us with the newly acquired resources necessary to bring the game to its best potential.  All of the links I provided aren't just occasional [strike]bugs[/strike] features that have blipped in and out throughout Fall Guys' lifespan. These have and have always appeared consistently and throughout the game's whole entire lifespan, and have never once been taken out of the game. At best, these can be considered controversial additions to gameplay, and at worst, these are haphazard displays of lack of support and a disconnect from the community to sustain the game properly.   I absolutely adore this game, and have grudged through its tenure in my library balancing the good and the bad. I've been through its original fad status, the lack of updates and disappointing Season 2, the savior of Squads mode reincarnating the game, the custom playlist cycles, and have been a day 1 player in each and every new season. After hundreds of hours, I can definitely mark my feelings down in this review. This is a good game with a horrible company, not malicious or evil, but absurdly lazy to the point that the most dedicated players aren't here just cause they're good - it's that these above experiences are so integrated into daily gameplay that at this point we just don't care anymore."
85835494,english,1,1097150,"this is a great game it has grown tremendously so let me enlighten those people who dropped the game halfway through season one.  1. repetition: the minigames are more diverse than ever, there are so many more minigames than in season 1, especially with the new update. Every show is different from one another especially with all the new side shows.  2. glitches: REDUCED TO ZERO, there are practically no more glitches in season 3 making the playing field even for everyone  3. cost: The cost is much more worth it! multiplayer is more enjoyable, and you get way more minigames and fun for your precious money, I assure you, $20 is a very good price  To sum it up this game is very good, if any of you dropped the game and have not played since season 1, you should change that."

I refuse to link my Steam account with Epic due to it being nothing more than a privacy invasion and a massive data-grab of Steam users.  When I purchase a game I do so taking the risk whether it is bad or not, that I accept, but to bring in account linking and passing information to another separate service AFTER my purchase, thereby changing my aggreement, that's just plain wrong."

This game is really fun... for the first 3-4 days. Once you get the initial hype out of it, the game just becomes repetetive and annoying. Once you get your first win, the game just becomes completely stale. Even with the new maps, I find myself playing cheap knockoffs more often than the actual game. For a ""chill"" game, most of the stages are just unreasonable punishing and extremely difficult to get any practice in. If you like that and have the budget, go ahead. But if you re just looking for a relaxing challenge to sink some hours into, this game is really just a waste of money. I did enjoy this game, but only for about 5 hours."

It's not because I'm afraid they'll dislike me or think I'm a freak or anything, it's that I just can't pinpoint an answer. I mean, yeah, the sexual attraction was always there, but I don't think that's really it. My dad was an alcoholic. He was never really there, he was always wasting his time and money at the bar. Before he left for the bar, he would always tell me, ""You stay there and play those games and if you're not there when I get back… well boy, there'll be hell to pay"". So I played video games. My favorite game was Fall Guys. I just loved that bean; the way he talked, the way he sang and dance. It was great. I… I guess I looked at Fall Guy as the father I never had. I mean, he taught me how to ride a bike, he taught me how to swim, he taught me everything. But I didn't just want to be LIKE Fall Guy, I wanted to BE him. Well, here I am, Fall Guy.

119268215,english,0,1097150,"Epic Games had to ruin everything. Removed the game from Steam, made it free and added microtransactions. Players that bought the game received awful rewards for buying it after it got free to play, and all the crowns we earned were turned into Kudos, a currency that is now obsolete because Epic created their own currency, the Show Bucks. Now most of the items use this new coin that players can only get by spending money, making the game less fun to play. In the past Players could get most skins if they were skilled enough for free, but now 80% of the good skins need to be paid with an exaggerated price, these skins are way to expensive for what they are worth especially considering they were obtainable with the old currency of the game that was free and could be earned by just playing it. It is so ironic that players that pre-ordered the game received a Gordon Freeman skin, a character made by Valve the creator of Steam, for the game now leaving Steam and join Rocket League on one of the worst Gaming Companies possible. I really feel betrayed with the decisions of the game devs because I always supported the game even in awful situations like the cheating problem, now to see everything *fall* apart, very sad to know that money can change anyone and make the worst mistakes ever. Last but not least I don't understand how people could accept this situation, why should these type of decisions should be accepted nowadays, if something like this happened in 2012 people would riot for a change, but nowadays it is something normal that people are used to, sadly. This may be the biggest reason why I prefer old games, no lazy unfinished products at day 1, no microtransactions, just a simple good game with good unlockables FOR FREE. Gaming companies are greedy and will want more, and in the future things will be way worse. We really shouldn't accept these actions, but sadly I guess we're too late. I miss the old days when everything was simple."

No. Is it the best optimized game out there (at least at the time of writing)? No. But what it does have is an amazing base game that's incredibly addicting. Even for the $20 its selling for, which in my opinion is a bit high, it's still a fantastic game that is incredibly fun to play with a group of friends.  Obviously there's a lot missing here: private multiplayer, custom matches, the lack of maps, actually being able to use your own name (lol), and the crackdown on cheating (to be completely fair I haven't encountered any). If you're skeptical about the game, I wouldn't blame you for waiting for it to go on sale or waiting until more content is added. We've seen this song and dance before: games release with a bare bones experience that's wildly fun, but gets old fast. That being said, I hope the developers continue to make this game better and better. Cut them some slack too, they got flooded with a player base they couldn't have expected. Let them get back on their feet after the floodgates opened, and show us what they can do.  Please keep going devs, I'm having a ton of fun so far but it's got a bit of a ways before it's really amazing. 8/10."
98256210,english,1,1097150,Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.  It's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!
74696182,english,1,1097150,"The Devolverland Expo led me to Fall Guys.  I was a little reluctant to get involved in a Battle Royale style game as I generally suck at competitive play but the sheer gleeful hilarity of this game more than makes up for the frustrations.  Are there server issues?  Sure.  Are there filthy filthy cheaters?  Oh you know it!  Am I still terrible?  Hoo boy am I ever.  Is it filled with bright colours, upbeat music, snappy mini games and lovable characters all bumbling their way to victory or slime?   Yes, yes it is and I love it.   +++UPDATE+++  So now I've played for, gee forty hours, seriously?  In that time I have managed to win two episodes.  Bear in mind I am terrible.  Two victories out of hundreds of failures.  Sweet sweet victories.  This sounds like a pretty bad ratio but really each victory feels truly momentous especially considering the ever increasing number of cheating hackers.  The cheating was something I could overlook when it was rare, but now it is the norm and it is really making me lose interest.  This is supposed to be Fall Guys, NOT Fly Guys.  There is very little competitive edge when you know the dude who is hovering above the level is going to automatically win!  I am now at the grinding stage just trying to collect the rest of the cosmetics for the season.    The initial shine has definitely dulled, and unless Mediatonic add some kind of anti cheat, this is going to quickly lose the large casual audience.  We shall see what Season 2 brings, but if the hackers are going to be allowed to continue operating I don't see myself joining the ranks of hopeful suckers never able to get a legitimate win.   ===UP-UPDATE===  So now I'm deeper than sixty hours in and Mediatonic have indeed listened to the criticisms levelled at their tiny little behemoth of a game.  There is now an anti cheat running in the background, which I know has been a bone of contention in some other releases (hello DOOM: Eternal) but it was desperately needed here and to be fair, I haven't happened upon any filthy dirty hackers since.  So now I can get back to being terrible through my own volition.  There has also been a refreshing of the levels.  A remixing of sorts.  The old tried and tested games have been given a lick of fresh paint and are all just a little bit different.  Clockwise rotating beams now might rotate anti-clockwise.  Wrecking balls that swung along the x axis now might swing along the y axis.  And there are random spinning hammers all over the shop.  It has definitely breathed fresh life into the game and really all my previous complaints have now been addressed.  Jolly well played there chaps.  Good form indeed.  Right, I'm off back to my glorious upbeat technicolour failure..."
117568023,english,0,1097150,"Once again, Epic Games sticks their greedy fingers into anything they can get their hands on. Their recent overhaul monetizes the hell out of the game, and they've screwed over long time players.  1. You're no longer able to get rare skins through playing the game alone, you now have to pay. The free currency (that was already a decent grind to get) can only be used to buy common stuff now.  2. Previously, crowns were typically used to purchase rare skins. They were only obtained through high placement, or very slowly through leveling. Now that crowns have been removed, there is far less incentive to actually grind and get good at the game.  3. Skins that used to be event exclusive are now being sold in the shop, which is unfair for anyone who had them.  4. Old legendary color skins are now common/rare, which is also unfair for those who had them.  It's been a good run, but I'm through with this game. There's literally nothing to play for anymore. I cant even finish the last achievement on my steam list without forking out cash, even though I ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME.

Then they made a PAID GAME into a free to play game, modifying the cosmetic shop so you can buy the cosmetics with real money (which degrades the value of the cosmetics, seeing as they were originally earned with crowns) and adding a battlepass with a premium track.  The game has since been going downhill.

98963553,english,1,1097150,"I've spent a ton of time playing this game, so I want to do my best to give an honest review of the game and do it justice.  A basic explanation on what the game is, would be a colorful and eye-popping battle royal style game that includes a multitude of different rounds to play - including solo race rounds, puzzle rounds, and skill based rounds. Team rounds are also a staple of the game play, pairing you up with random players in your lobby to work towards a common goal. However, there is only one crown, and therefore can only be one winner! In some cases there can be multiple winners, but for this to happen you have to have cooperation with the rest of the lobby and some skill in order to time out rounds.  The game play feels choppy at times, is the best way I can describe it. The crowd physics in the game, regarding interacting with other players through running into their character or grabbing them for different purposes, has from day one been an ongoing issue. While some games you can play with no issues and great server connection, other games will have you frustrated, especially in game modes requiring the grabbing aspect to either steal tails, hold Pegwins or trying to fight back against someone trying to grief you. I feel like it'll forever be an issue in the game, because the problem seems to be much deeper than just a simple patch can fix. I understand that this issue can be a deal breaker for new players, and I want to reiterate that it will become a problem for every player at some point.  For a game that looks colorful and fun and simple to play, there is a strong competitive player base that makes the games much more difficult for unsuspecting players. There are some people who will be able to pick up the game quickly and roll with the punches, but for most players there is a learning curve involved. I'm currently, as of this review, still under 600 crowns in total with 900 hours of playtime. I personally enjoy playing the game with friends, however, and spend a lot of time in game modes such as Squads Show and 2-3 man squads. This isn't a game that I think you can solely play competitively, and if you're going to continue coming back to the game you should find a way to have fun while playing! That can be any reason - grief other players, play with friends, or helping other players win. There's an amazing scene of streamers and players on Twitch that really got me hooked on the game, and I encourage anyone looking for other players to check out someone they like on that site! Personally I recommend DjBigRuss and CrazyyTrainn, but there are plenty of people to chat and play with!  Overall, it's a game - there will be plenty of people who enjoy it, and many others who dislike it. There's plenty of players online however, and finding a match doesn't take very long at all. With all the different levels and variations of those levels, along with an interactive media team and a development team that brings new content to the game as soon as they can. I recommend giving the game a chance at some point, if you're not willing to spend $20 for it then wait until it goes on sale. It's a wonderful game and I've met some wonderful people I don't think I would have met without this game, and it'll forever be a game that I have a ton of love for."

73778456,english,0,1097150,"Update 9.19.20 || The devs have addressed the cheating issue and have finally added EAC, which has helped to alleviate the cheating problem. I'm still going to leave this review as it was at the time that I wrote it to stand as testament to how terrible this game was on release.   I still don't recommend this game. I have zero faith in these developers. The anticheat took far longer than it should have to be added and all the other issues with this game still remain unaddressed.   PS, usernames are STILL disabled. I'm pretty confident the developers have no intention of re-enabling them. RIP grabbing ttv streamers, it was the only truly fun thing to do in this game.   //  This game's launch has been an absolute trainwreck.  THE GAME RUNS ENTIRELY CLIENT-SIDE, which means people can blatantly speedhack with no special hack tools. The game also has NO ANTI-CHEAT, AT ALL. The closest thing to anti-cheat is a single text channel in the game's official Discord where you can manually report cheaters, which, surprise, doesn't actually get any cheaters banned.   Users were able to use HTML in their Steam username to make their names appear large or colorful in-game. I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to ""Fall Guy ####"". WHY NOT JUST FIX THE HTML IN USER'S NAMES. Let me give your programmers a hint, it's called input sanitization, you can look up a tutorial for it on YouTube and actually do your job.  So with those two problems coupled together, yeah let me just go and file a report against someone with nothing but the username ""Fall Guy 1234"" to go on—I can't even track their Steam account through recent games. Keep in mind also that this game has a million-some players and there are only 4 digits in each randomized name, so there are going to be several dozen duplicates of each numerical name. The devs couldn't track that to a player even if they wanted to, so no one is getting banned for cheating. Great work guys. It's only going to get worse as the game goes on if nothing gets fixed.   This game has the worst netcode of any game I've ever played. There's a gamemode that involves running around the map and stealing tails from other players. This minigame was copy-pasted twice to make three equally garbage modes, I've heard dozens of complains against them from friends and streamers and I don't think a single person actually enjoys playing them. Enemies with Walmart parking lot tier internet can grab you from over 10 feet away and when you attempt to grab the tail off an enemy you can see the grab icon pop up on their character and nothing happens 50% of the time. It's so inconsistent that there's almost no skill here, just pure luck.   Nobody enjoys the forced team gamemodes either. You only have a small amount of control to the outcome of team games, so winning equates to a simple game of luck based on how bad your teammates are. In addition to that, this is a physics-based game, using Unity's default physics engine. It's horrifically inconsistent and sometimes your character will simply trip over their own feet, falling down and losing the game because someone grabs your tail while you're on the floor, or you jump down a level on Hex-a-gone and your character simply trips for no reason and you fall to your death while you try to stand up. The physics make the game feel horrible to play. Half of the minigames feel like they were quickly thrown together in the last 2 weeks of development to meet quota. Especially ""Perfect Match"", the game where no one ever dies unless they're literally afk.   Only *one day* after releasing, the game's servers completely died, for absolutely everyone, for almost an entire day. They had previously been dropping constantly in the middle of games. The devs' had presumably been attempting to migrate their servers to a different host with a larger capacity, but apparently failed to do so and were being very secretive as to why. They had announced a maintenance would begin at 6:00 am, but randomly decided to begin six hours early at peak player count time and gave no ETA for when it would be finished. The ""maintenance"" ended up taking almost the entire day and no one could play the game the entire time. When the game first officially released they deliberately avoided announcing the time that the game would unlock. They also avoided notifying players when the servers were back online after the ""maintanance"". They clearly knew the servers would choke on the first day and didn't fix the servers in the three day period before the game launched, or, you know, several months before, they had ample reason to predict this would be a problem but did nothing.    My favorite part of it all is that the developers are BLAMING THE PLAYERS for their problems. On Twitter they blamed the players when the servers went over capacity, clearly their fault, and they blamed the players when users used html in their names, also clearly their own fault. Fix your game.   The game has a separate Twitter account for the server status. Not only has the account constantly lied about the status of the servers, in addition to claiming they ""would tweet when the servers are back online"" and then didn't, I thought it was pretty hilarious that the main Twitter playfully posted something along the lines of ""Look how many people are following our server account!"". Yeah, no, they're not following that because they want to hear your awful hello-fellow-kids tweets, they're doing it because they want to know when the servers are going to be back online for the game they all paid $20 for.    The devs had MONTHS to beta test this game and somehow bafflingly didn't catch on to the fact that the servers wouldn't have enough capacity to handle the amount of players on launch. Or fix the broken netcode. Or add anticheat. Or fix html in usernames. Or rework the bad minigames. I refuse to believe this kind of stuff wasn't caught in QA, which means either there was no QA, or the devs just ignored the feedback.    I've never seen a company shoot themselves in the foot and handle success so poorly.  And to the people claiming that this is excusable because ""they're just a small indie company"", it isn't, because they're not. They have 230 employees and have existed since 2005. This is pure incompetence. I don't see this game lasting past its first season."
80884289,english,1,1097150,"I've had Fall Guys for a while now, and while the game now is merely a shadow of what it once was during it's first month of release, that doesn't take away from the fact that Fall Guys is a really great game to kill some time or play with friends. The gameplay is fun yet slightly challenging and the different courses are very reminiscent of those TV shows I used to watch as a kid. That said though there are a limited number of courses you can play through and though fun for a while they get old very fast, after about 2 hours I had seen every course in the game and after playing the same courses over and over again, sometimes back to back, it started to become a drag. All in all though I still recommend Fall Guys for when you have a few spare hours to burn or for when you're with your friends and wanna get a quick laugh."

78158202,english,0,1097150,"Fall Guys, as a concept, is a wondrous spin on the battle royale genre we’ve seen in recent years. My woes, however, stem from what I’m assuming is a dev team that’s trying their best with a playerbase they never expected.   Let me preface by saying that I am absolutely in love with this game, it’s probably one of my most favorites to come out in recent years. Solo matches are what I do to turn off my brain and relax for a bit. Playing with friends can lead to many laughs and wholehearted fun- but... only when it works. This is where my first problem stems:   Matchmaking into a game when queued with others on my friends list can be super dodgy. We get matched into different games from each other entirely, some of us just drop out of our team in the menu completely out of left field, or there will be a hard disconnect while we’re playing in an ongoing match. I do note, however, the disconnection issues have gotten better since one of their season 2 patches, so I thank them for that.  Another lingering issue I have is that ever since the mid-season update during the first season, one of my friends has been falsely flagged for cheating ever since EAC has been implemented. He has exhausted every option to get a concrete answer as to why they’ve been banned since then, only to be told that they -won’t- reverse it and won’t even tell him why he was banned in the first place. I KNOW he doesn’t cheat. This is the same EAC that’s used in games like Rust and Fortnite, and he can still play those games at full capacity.  No mention of what program it could’ve been, no real explanation... nothing. I’ve been unable to play with my friend for the longest time and it makes me both upset and sad that this is still going on. So... if you’re dealt a terrible card like he was, good luck! Because for some reason they won’t tell you why or how you got banned. That’s money down the drain. No chance at a refund if you’ve been playing for awhile.  My second most frustrating ordeals are when I see Mediatonic tout brand new variations for maps that a small group of players have said are too easy/boring when adding spinning pillars or hammers should be -last- on their list. Players being bored of a single two-minute match is a non-issue. Players can ABSOLUTELY handle a dry spell of the same map if it means that the devs could spend time and resources fixing prevalent bugs that have been in the game since day one.  Some bugs and issues I can remember off the top of my head:  - Broken hoops in the hoop games where you successfully jump in them and don’t earn a point  -Grabbing the crown in Fall Mountain only for the grab to not register at all, so you fall and someone else grabs the crown. Sometimes I would literally be dangling on the crown because I haven’t let go for a good few seconds in hopes that it will register my win, but then someone else runs in and gets the win instead  -Falling in-between the middle of three hexagons in Hex-a-Gone because the velocity messes with your bean, thus falling onto the levels below, or just getting eliminated immediately into the slime  -Jumping on a “crack” between two adjacent platforms in Jump Showdown and having my input get eaten, so my bean just simply doesn’t jump and I get swept away  -Minor (but annoying) issues like where my bean will be placed if I fall in a weird zone during one of the gauntlet levels (ex: in Whirlygig with the middle shortcut with the fan at the end, if you fall in a very particular place surrounding it, the game sets you up at the very BEGINNING of the map. So trigger zones or respawn placements really desparately need to be looked at.)  I don’t want to leave a negative review because I know game dev work is a lot. I’m leaving one (and hopefully, just for now) in the hopes that this gets read and passed along.   Your playerbase doesn’t need new big yeetuses, it needs answers and relief from some of the bugs that hinder the very core of your game on a near-daily basis.   Us players can wait for new mechanics and silly shenanigans, but everything I listed above is also just some of the several handfuls of bugs and problems I’ve encountered so far, and I know I’m not the only player with these issues. A quick look on the most popular Fall Guys subreddit will show you similar complaints, too.  I’ve amassed many hours into this game and probably over 90-100 wins currently, so know that my issues come from a place of wanting to see this game thrive. I adore Fall Guys, you have something lovely in your hands, so all I hope is that you devote some love back into the facets that need it most right now. As much as I want more people to get into this game, it’s hard to recommend it in its current state. While I may be patient with its many bugs and disconnects, there is also many others who will leave the game flat because of it.  You can do better, just by re-focusing on what’s important. I hope I can change my review in the future, but please, I hope this all gets heard. I wish Mediatonic the best of luck."

97365813,english,1,1097150,I have over 1300 hours on this game and it has given me the time of my life. I could never find a game that fitted me because ever other game in the world has complicated controls with 60 buttons. Fall Guys with 4 buttons is so incredibly simple and fun and made mine and so many others lives better in quarantine. Happy Birthday fall Guys!!
74006830,english,1,1097150,"There's no doubt Fall Guys deserves every ounce of the hype it's receiving - the game is ridiculously fun and an absolute blast to play alone or alongside a handful of friends, easily knocking Gang Beasts and similar titles off of their pedestals.  I trust Mediatonic will listen to the outcry for new levels, balancing, and content... but Fall Guys [b]will[/b] inevitably get repetitive and boring in the long run. For this reason, I encourage them to say attentive to community feedback and not fall into the void of trend-games; to do so, Fall Guys could follow in these three steps:   [b]Step One - Essentials[/b]  To begin, there's clearly a few minor issues with the game that most people are reporting across all platforms - notably regarding team games. Working together to complete objectives is fun, but individual skill currently holds no weight when qualifying for the next round.  Solving this is straightforward; team games should stay, but players may individually qualify throughout the round if they score enough points or hold the objective for enough seconds. Playing team games during a semi-final is very disappointing, since it's hard to shake the feeling that you may not qualify for the finals due to a rogue teammate.  Aside from team games, the majority of the minigames are hilarious, but I really hope that we don't have to wait for the end of the season for new maps. Seasons are around 60 days long which concerns me since there's a chance that we'll be in the same rotation of maps for another 2 months.   [b]Step Two - Update and Innovate[/b]  Undoubtedly, the most obvious way to maintain an active playerbase is to add new maps and skins, but this option can only be done so much before stagnating - I really want to see Fall Guys reaching the numbers it's doing right now around this time next year. To do this, Mediatonic need to be actively innovating and bringing in new features beyond the base game. Examples include:  [i]8-player Parties[/i]  Doubling the party size would be a great first non-map/non-cosmetic update - this currently being the main barrier holding back a few of my friends from buying, since our group cannot fit in a single party.  [i]New Moves[/i]  Controlling your Fall Guy is genius in its simplicity. Jumping, diving, and grabbing seem basic on the surface, but play a huge role in finding shortcuts, eliminating other players or getting a final boost of speed before reaching the finish line. However, as there are still many unused keys on both keyboard and controller, it'd be great to throw in an extra move or two.  One idea may be a high risk, yet high reward 'punt' button, allowing you to kick over a nearby opponent after a few seconds of charging up. However, missing a kick would cause your character to tumble forward, leaving them at risk to obstacles or other players.  [i]Weekly Event Days[/i]  Counter-Strike's War Games and Fortnite's LTM's opened up a new market for developers to satisfy niches in their audience, but tend to be stale and unexciting after a while.  Rather than sticking to the cookie-cut format of scattering limited-time modes throughout the year, Mediatonic could innovate by claiming a specific day of the week, introducing a unique spin on the entire game for 24 hours. '100-player Fridays' may be feasible; a once-a-week alternative to standard 60 player matches, containing exciting minigames tailored for larger groups alongside prodigious rewards for those who secure the crown. Providing the community with interesting spins on standard gameplay in small but addictive chunks may assist Fall Guys in moulding into [i]""that game we always play on Fridays""[/i], gradually shifting towards a lifestyle game that keeps people coming back to play week by week.  [i]Streamer Lobbies[/i]  Streamers will often return to games that enable them to play with their community, or host games such as 'Marbles On Stream' allowing active viewers to compete for personalised gifts such as a paid subscription, shout-out, or merchandise. With minimal crossover in this niche already, Fall Guys has an opportunity to grant streamers the ability to open a private lobby - rather than compete for crowns, viewers instead join through a room code and compete for a predetermined prize at the discretion of the streamer.   [b]Step Three - Sustaining Beyond 2020[/b]  With a mixture of luck and commitment, Fall Guys could become a smash hit, continuing to flourish over many years. Without getting too ahead of themselves, Mediatonic could consider opening their game up to the Steam workshop later down the line so players can upload their own maps and modes for approval. This way, Fall Guys is never short of quality content and unique ideas for the years to come!   To summarise, Fall Guys is awesome yet still has legroom to grow even bigger and better. In spite of expected day one issues, Fall Guys is far from being just another washed up gimmick, on the exception that Mediatonic really knuckle down on content and balancing [b]before[/b] the first season ends.  I strongly recommend Fall Guys and wish the very best for Mediatonic moving forward!"
77232547,english,0,1097150,"The updates are extremely slow and underwhelming, they hyped up season 2 so much and all they added was like a few new game modes and a couple changes to already existing maps.  Otherwise, the game is repetitive and gets boring really fast."

83890236,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a battle royale game where the player must guide their character through a series of events inspired by TV shows like Takeshi’s Castle or Ninja Warrior. Starting with 60 players in the match, roughly 10-15 players will be eliminated each round until the match ends with 1 winner.  There are lots of different events in the rotation so you won’t see the same ones in every match. Some events have players competing individually while others divide the players up into either 2 or 3 teams, with everybody on the losing team being eliminated.  Some events are races, where the player must jump over bottomless pits, avoid obstacles such as swinging axes, balls on chains and spinning blades, and cross the finish line as quickly as possible. In other events you have to score points by jumping through hoops, carrying eggs to a nest or pushing giant balls into goals. Or you might just need to stand on a platform while hazards try to knock you off. In some events, falling off the level will let you respawn at a checkpoint and try again, while in others, falling into slime results in instant elimination.  This is the first game I’ve played in the battle royale genre, and I’m enjoying the challenge of trying to get a win. I’d imagine most experienced gamers will find the first couple of rounds fairly easy to qualify from, but in the later rounds with only the best players remaining, it can be tough. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve finished in second or third place.  If you’ve watched your favourite streamer play Fall Guys (there was a time when pretty much everybody on Youtube was playing) and get annoyed by other players, I can confirm I know exactly how they feel. There’s nothing worse than somebody jumping into you just as you touch a bouncepad, causing you to fly off the level at a random angle, or when somebody grabs you for no reason (like, on a race event where they’ve got nothing to gain because it slows them down too), or when you dominate a team event but your team loses anyway. In most events though, its possible to recover from a couple of errors and still qualify, and being the last person to qualify for the next round feels great.  If you make it through to the final round, a complete match should take around 20 minutes to play. You’ll earn a couple of types of currency based on how far you survived, which lets you unlock some wacky cosmetic items. In 20 hours of gameplay I haven’t noticed any bugs. The physics sometimes feels a bit random but I think that is intentional because its a weird gameshow. Controls feel fine on my Xbox 360 controller. The art style is colourful and the music for most rounds is entertaining.  Fall Guys is a fun (and occasionally annoying) game to play if you’re looking for some wacky multiplayer action. Don’t let the art style fool you, it gets quite competitive in the later rounds. And there’s enough content and replayability to justify the price."
121547856,english,0,1097150,"I do not recommend this game after it was taken off the steam platform and put on Epic Games. It's turned into micro-transaction hell. It doesn't matter if you win anymore, so why keep playing?"
100479163,english,1,1097150,"[h1] Video Games [/h1]   While Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout isn't nearly as popular as it was around the time it launched, it still remains a perfect video game for what it sets out to accomplish. Its presentation, gameplay, low skill floor and price tag make it accessible to anyone who'd want to give it a try. If you're looking for something refreshing to play with a group of friends, even those who might not be big on video games, then look no further.   Gameplay-wise, it is the best Wipeout or Ninja Warrior game (n?)ever made. You know, those shows where people have to beat an obstacle course in order to win the prize money? Here it’s a bit different, with up to 60 players thrown into a match, consisting of several rounds. At the end of every round, those who fail to complete the objective in time are eliminated. Not every round is an obstacle course however, but can be anything from a vast plethora of minigames spread into six different categories.   For example, Race rounds will always task you with reaching the finish line of the course before a certain number of players manage to. Survival rounds will require you to not get eliminated before a certain number of players does, or a timer runs out. These are then further differentiated by themes and obstacles. One Survival round might have you balance atop of an ever-moving platform, dodging projectiles launched at you, while another will place you in an arena with three giant Rhinos attempting to knock you out. Team rounds, which require you to work with random players towards a common goal to prevent your entire team from being eliminated are all about scoring points, but can either be a game of basketball, football (the soccer kind) or collecting as high of a number of eggs as possible.   In the main game mode, a match must always start with a Race and end with a Finale – the most suspenseful, final round of the match, usually a Race that only one player can win or a Survival round that keeps going until the last man standing. Other game modes, both fixed and rotating, focus on specific categories or levels themselves. There are also custom matches you can make for you and your friends.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618963922  Even if all rounds across a category follow a certain pattern, none ultimately feel the same. Additional obstacles will sometimes appear on maps they were previously absent from, so the game can still throw you a curveball even when you think you have them all memorised.   Still, some are clearly better designed than others. Door Dash, a Race round, is a course consisting entirely out of doors. Some of these are openable, while the others aren’t – with there being no way of telling between the two until you try going through them. It almost completely eradicates the momentum of the match. If you go for an unlocked door consistently enough, you’ll qualify. If you don’t, tough luck. Other levels that solely consist of multitudes of the same obstacle have a similar effect, though none are as bad as Door Dash.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618967222  The controls are quite tight due to how limited they are. You can jump, grab (players, ledges, objects and some objectives) and dive, so the game requires a total of three buttons to play – excluding movement. A controller is ideal, but the keyboard and mouse perform almost just as well.  Progression feels good, but it could be better. Winning a round will net you a Crown, the game’s ’’premium’’ currency awarded solely through wins or milestones in the current Season’s battle pass-like progression, called Fame levels – limited to 50 per Season and increased by XP, which is awarded for each match you play. Each Crown you acquire also increases your overall player rank, which awards you cosmetics upon leveling up and is separate from your Fame level.   Besides Crowns, there are Kudos, a second currency awarded at certain Fame levels, as well as upon completion of a match regardless of whether you won or not. Kudos can also be purchased through microtransactions, in bundles as costly as $50, more than twice the game’s price. While the game isn’t by any means stingy with its rewards, the progression does feel a bit staggered and the inclusion of microtransactions can’t help but make me think of some marketing analyst or currency designer figuring out how to optimize it best to incentivise a purchase. Even when they aren’t intrusive, they’re there for a reason.  Your rewards can be spent in the store for cosmetic items. Some cost Kudos, some cost Crowns. There’s a fixed number of items that can be displayed in the store at a time and they reset once a day. Simple as. Customization options for your Fall Guy are quite varied and some visually striking combinations are possible, even without playing much.  Visually, the game is a colorful joy to look at, with the audio making it all the more appealing. The Fall Guys make cute ’’oofs“ and other sounds when they collide with each other, and scream of excitement when an obstacle launches them into the air – all of it heightened by a groovy, bass driven soundtrack. It just oozes fun.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618970077  Performance wise, the game ran great on max settings, at a steady 60 FPS. However, the animation LOD distance wasn’t that great, as players and obstacles further away would be running at a notably lower framerate. I don’t know if this is simply the way the game’s optimised, or something affected by the limitations of my specs. Weirdly enough, the game would sometimes drop down to 30 FPS while waiting in the lobby or the post-match recap.   Reviewed on the following system:  [table][tr][td]CPU [/td][td]AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6GHz[/td][/tr][tr][td]GPU[/td][td]GeForce GTX 1050Ti[/td][/tr][tr][td]RAM [/td][td]16GB[/td][/tr][/table]  While the game’s current player numbers are a far cry from what it once had, it still maintains a healthy population, both on Steam and outside of it, thanks to cross-play. I wholeheartedly hope that Mediatonic can keep Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout in such a state, as it’s a fun game that truly anyone can play. Even if you don’t end up winning, the little animation your Fall Guy does during the post-match summary shows that he’s had a lot of fun even participating, just as you will. Here’s to hoping it can keep going strong in the years to come, at least as long until there’s a worthy successor.

175129706,english,0,1097150,"Epic games ruined this game. originally winning would earn you a currency called crowns that could be used to buy the cool cosmetics including the collab skins. now that epic has bought this game the crowns currency has been removed and any crowns you had saved up were turned into free currency which can only get you basic recolors or old generic skin parts. all the cool new cosmetics are bought with a new paid currency that you cant earn for free. winning used to be desirable since you would earn things you'd actually want, now winning means nothing other than progress on the terrible battle passes that are always full of junk and almost never include collab skins. half of the battle pass is recolors of skins already in that pass and many of the ""new"" skins are slight variants of skins from the first few seasons of the game. epic games has ruined the gameplay loop of the game and just keeps adding over complicated or stupid long stages that further stray away from the original fast paced style of the game."
74905856,english,1,1097150,"[h1][b]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout - a virtual mirror for human behaviour![/b][/h1]  [h1]Let the games begin[/h1]  Imagine 60 brightly colored jelly beans dressed up in grotesquely jumbled up costumes and with the same goal - a golden crown. The winner is determined by 3 types of mini-games: race, survival and team. Each next task depends on how many players are still competing. You can run, jump, do a racing dive and grab - that´s it. As in real life everyone lives out their character. You will be pushed into the abyss, jostled, attacked by teams and finally mocked before the finish line. Please also welcome the fraudulent plague of the digital age that is literally flying over the cuckoo's nest. And ultimately the game physics, based on loss of movement control, ensures mass collisions and gives you the rest.  In a nutshell: 60 beans line up, one wins.  [h1]+/-[/h1]  + Takeshi´s Castle style + play with up to 3 friends + quick matchmaking + fast games - max 15-20 minutes to the crown I didn´t get once + rumbling jelly beans + hilarious fun and absurd situations + free season pass + customization - costumes, emotes, victory poses etc. + more hilarious fun and even more absurd situations + watch remaining players after reaching the finish line or even when you´re out  +/- easy to learn but(t) hard to master - did I mention I never got a single crown?!! +/- monetization for cosmetics and the game currency Kudos +/- your starting position can make the small but subtle difference, rotation makes it fair +/- after 1-2 hours you know all mini-games, but more are announced  - There´s nothing really negative to say about Fall Guys. Yes, there are cheaters, but show me a multiplayer game where these dishonorable beings don´t show up. And yes, the unexpected success of Fall Guys initially completely overwhelmed the servers and you still may experience a disconnect or lag here and there. So what, go for the next round. Unfortunately there is a trend for negativity in reviews and forums these days because people have neither understanding nor patience anymore. And in the end all depends on how developers communicate with their player base and solve problems. They did a great job so far and seem to really care about their game.  [h1]Is Fall Guys worth your time and money?[/h1]  Absolutely! It´s screamingly funny and the first so-called Battle Royale that I enjoy. No ranking lists, no weapons to master and in lack of a chat no russian pet names for your mother. Fall Guys definitely is the multiplayer feast of this summer that nobody expected. So join the party or be a party pooper."
91703128,english,1,1097150,"As a child I always wanted to participate in the Japanese show Takeshi Castle. I certainly wasn't expecting to relive that fantasy while playing as a jelly bean but alas here I am.  The premise is simple, race and fight your way to victory in order to retrieve the crown. It's rather addictive game which can leave you feeling like a ruling tyrant or going through all the stages of grief."

164994638,english,0,1097150,"Newest update ruined the game. [list] [*]They forced creative content into the main shows. Most of them don't have clear descriptions or instructions on their loading screens. Is this a race? survival? You don't know until you figure it out live in the game. [*]The quality of these maps vary widely. [*]Many of them don't follow design principles and can't be sight read. Falling feels more like a ""gotcha!"" moment than actual failure. [*]The starting groups are now smaller so winning doesn't have as much impact. [/list]  The only good thing I saw was that there is a faster transition between games.  They need to bring back the old choices and let players choose to play creative maps or standard. What would really make this game shine again is bringing back all the old maps they've removed over the years in an ""everything goes"" mode."
74044622,english,1,1097150,"I guess I get to write a review for this right away because my ""review after finishing a game"" policy doesn't apply here as Fall Guys is a game that never ends and I hope just keeps going on forever.  It's a cute battle royale which I haven't had the pleasure of playing since Mario Party or something like that.  Every woman, man and his dog already knows about Fall Guys so let's just get down to brass tacks.  __________________  [h1] PROS [/h1]  +  Fun with a capital F.  Everything is colourful and playful and when I played each time the servers were pretty fast.    +  room for improvement.  We are in season 1 now and I hope that next seasons come with new maps.  There is a huge window of opportunity to keep the game fresh and therefore the play-count high.  The devs are going to have to really focus on this aspect because at 60 players per room, that's a helluva goal to set to keep this game alive.  But to be fair when you have a bunch of seasons of Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle to draw from for inspiration then we are all set for a few years I think.  +  maps.  There are a lot of maps but I haven't experienced them all yet in my 4 hours.  Some are better than others but everyone will have their own preferences.  Some maps are hectic scrums, others require a bit more platforming savvy techniques, others yet have a more physical dexterity aspect.  There is something for everyone.  +  microtransactions are purely cosmetic and offer no bonuses to the players.  There are a bunch of skins you can buy or grind out using the in-game currency, Kudos.  But there is nothing I can see that offers a speed or jumping bonus, etc.  Just MTX to keep funding the game once saturation of the player base has been reached, I suppose.  -------------------------  [h1] CONS [/h1]  -  names.  EVERYONE has a username of fallguy XXXX where X=numbers.  I want to put my own name in there.  I want to see my friends I am playing with.  I want to know that b'stard that pushed me off a ledge.    -  controls.  The controls seem a bit too sluggish for me.  Changing direction or trying to grab something can feel like you are doing it through a pool of syrup.  -  hackers ruin everything.  I have only seen a couple but they are out there and they are x10 faster than us, they begin before the starting gun fires, they jump higher and further than us and it is zero fun watching them take the crown.  -------------------------  Fall Guys is a blast.  Trust me and the millions of other jellybeans that are going bananas over this title."
118666489,english,0,1097150,"I remember when I bought this game in 2021. A key part of that memory involves the fact that, at that time, I was actually able to, you know, play the game. (For a few hours. I think I snagged it during a sale, tried it out for a bit, and then planned on playing it more substantially later.)  Now. in 2022, I attempt to start the game up. I discover that there are now about 10 layers of Epic Games garbage retrofitted to the game; and so in addition to taking forever to launch, it never gets past the very first ""Loading"" screen. I literally can't even make it to the main menu. I've done all the usual troubleshooting steps, and nothing works. [b]It's just completely effing broken.[/b]  Add to that the various other controversial changes apparently done to the game in the time since the developers/publishers sold their souls to Epic Games (these changes are well-documented by others), and the only message I can reasonably say I'm getting from the people behind this game is a giant middle finger.  I'm currently attempting to get a refund, since I bought the game under a particular understanding, and the game has been completely changed in such a way that it no longer reflects the buying decision I originally made at all. (For example: when I bought it, I did so on the understanding that I would be able to, like, you know, [b]play the game[/b], or at least even get to the main menu. And while this was possible at the time I paid for the game, it's no longer possible. Not being able to play the game is one fairly significant factor that would generally tend to make me not want to spend money on a game and buy it.)  [b]If the developers/publishers are going to take away my ability to play the game I paid for, then I think it's only fair that I be allowed to take away the money that I gave them, in good faith, on the understanding that I'd be able to effing play the damn thing in the first place.[/b]  [b]UPDATE:[/b]  For anyone who runs into the same problem I did: After an inane amount of time wasted troubleshooting this stupid problem, I have concluded that the infinite loading screen is, in fact, actually just Epic Games's intuitive way of informing you that you need to link your Epic Games account to your Steam account in order for the game to load. Their game overlay system is apparently broken or fucked or whatever, and so it just doesn't bother to show up and inform you of what the hell you need to actually do. This is genius-level game design. Also, if you weren't able to figure out that ""infinite loading screen means I need to link my accounts"", then you are probably an idiot who will be yelled at by other, definitely much smarter, people for not being able to figure out such an obvious thing yourself.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840429916"
79725349,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout is one of the most popular of this year, so let's take a look at this Takeshi Castle inspired game. Since there's no story, let's jump into graphics.   Graphics:  Fall Guys has an absolutely amazing art style. The world is bright and colorful and the bean people you control are absolutely adorable. You can also buy different costumes and outfit your bean with the style that suits you the best. There will be that one costume that you will definitely want to save up for and bring into every game you go into.   The bright and colorful look of the world is an absolute joy. Everything is splattered with bright colors like pink, blue, yellow and others, it honestly reminded me of cartoons I would watch as a kid. The game is really pleasant to the eye and for that I got to give major props to the designers.   Audio:  The music of Fall Guys has no reason to be as good as it is. Most of the tracks are insanely catchy, especially the final round music which is by far the best track in the game. Most of the other ones are also really good and honestly I loved most of the tracks in the game.  One other thing is the sound effects. First of all, I got to admit that the sounds the beans make when expressing joy, sadness and when something happens when they bump into something or fall are incredibly adorable. That's the one thing that I never get sick of when playing the game.  Also the beans themselves look mushy and the sounds they make when bumping into things is oddly satisfying. Overall I think the audio design and it's a definite highlight of the game, especially the incredibly catchy soundtrack.  Gameplay:  Ever watched Takeshi's Castle ? Wipeout ? Well imagine if Fall Guys is the video game adaption of those two shows. The game is basically a battle royale where you go through obstacle courses until you're the last man standing. So let's talk about the meat and potatoes of the game, which is the courses.  There's a good variety of courses in the game, ranging from races, team games and survival games. Race courses are courses where you race to the finish line, while avoiding obstacles. Team games are usually objective games where you team up with other players to compete against other teams and lastly survival games where you avoid stuff trying to survive until enough players are eliminated.   The good majority of the courses are really well designed and fun to play, they rely on your skill and when you have one very clean run avoiding everything and coming out at the front is so satisfying, however a good majority of the courses are incredibly poorly designed.   First of all there's a few courses in the game where a few players have to sacrifice themselves so other players can win. This is mostly a problem in Tip Toe and Wall Guys, where a couple of players have to set up a path for the other players to follow, which will definitely mean they will lose.  Not to mention See Saw, where players will refuse to stand on one side because that will put them behind other players.  But those usually have nothing on the team games. Pretty much all of these are incredibly poorly designed. These game modes never rely on your skill, but the skill of the players that are assigned to your team. You might get unlucky and get players that leave that one course they simply hate and would rather just get into another game, or as soon as you're one point behind, they will start trolling. Most of these are incredibly tedious and when I get a team game,  I find the experience more tedious than fun.   Once enough players are eliminated you go into the finale. There's currently four different finales and honestly these are a mixed bag. The most poorly designed is Fall Mountain. This is a course where you race to the top of a mountain to grab a crown and this is a course that is purely dependent on the RNG of the game. If there's enough players for three rows, if you're in row three, you can basically give up before the game even begins.   Another one that I find incredibly stupid is Jump Showdown. In this one you're on platforms avoiding a pillar that keeps spinning, trying to knock you off, until there's only one man left standing. In this one the platforms keep falling off and there is a high possibility you can get stuck on a side that will lose all platforms with no way to recover. But if you do find yourself on the last few platforms left standing, then it's purely skill that can get you the win.   Also each course has different variations with different obstacles   Even with these negatives, I found the game a ton of fun and most of the courses incredibly fun, hopefully the bad ones get taken out of the game and reworked or the just vaulted entirely and I really want more skill based finales.   Verdict:  Fall Guys is a ton of fun and honestly even with it's issues I had an absolute blast going through the crazy courses, racing other players and getting that sweet sweet crown. Overall for the price you get a really solid multiplayer experience, which could last you countless hours. If you're looking for something bright to cheer you up in dark times, Fall Guys is definitely the game to go with.   Final Rating: 9/10  Pros: + Most courses are incredibly fun to go through + Bright and cute art style is pleasing to the eye + Amazing score   Cons: - Tons of courses depend on luck, rather than skill - Team games  If you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews"

73803912,english,0,1097150,"I'll start off with saying this is FAR from a bad game, and definitely has potential to be a great and fun experience, but right now it just has some glaring issues that really put me off from playing more than just a few games, I heavily encourage you to look up more reviews and gameplay to decide if it's something for you but here's what nags me personally;  [h1]Repetitiveness[/h1] Right now it's difficult for me to really keep going as you keep seeing the same maps over and over in just a few hours of playtime, and most of these involve running forward from one end to the other before X amount of players do, with the inspiration this game draws from Takeshi's Castle this is understandable, but I feel like more could be done in this regard to make the average game more varied.  [h1]Team games feel awful[/h1] Generally I enjoy the game in short bursts, but I have absolutely never enjoyed any of the team games, it honestly just feels like a 2 minute wait to roll your 66% or 50% chance to not be eliminated, this isn't helped by the fact teams can be uneven in terms of player numbers and objectives spawning at random in some of these minigames, I really wish there was an option to opt out of these.  [h1]Winning as a currency[/h1] This is entirely subjective, but I hate this, of course there's skill involved but winning is mostly a random ordeal from my experience, yet there's time-limited cosmetics you can only obtain by winning 10 or so games, quickly shifting the focus from lighthearted fun to just getting annoyed if you don't get the crown should you be interested in any of those cosmetics. I really wish there was no arbitrary time limit on these things or another way to get the currency so you can steadily progress, the pressure to win is something I don't enjoy in a casual party game, of course reward the winner but please don't lock things solely behind winning games.  [h1]Final rounds are very discouraging.[/h1] Currently there are 3 minigames for the final round to decide the winner, two of these feel utterly pointless to me as one of them is a race, but you spawn in 2 rows, if you don't spawn in the first row you've generally lost from the second it starts. The other game involves holding an item when a timer runs out, which generally just results in running in a circle for 2 minutes, only to end up in a clump of people for the last few seconds, mashing the grab button and praying you have the thing when the clock runs out, which is more frustrating than anything. The third game is one I actually enjoy where you need to move across disappearing platforms in multiple layers to avoid falling down, the last one standing wins, this doesn't feel as random or reliant on luck and makes for a much more fun experience, I hope more final minigames follow this trend.   All that said, I'm still excited to see where this game goes, as new maps and minigames are already planned, and I'm already very close to recommending the game."
73975501,english,1,1097150,"There is just something about running head first into doors as a cute bean in a raptor outfit, 60 people bumping into each other, sounds of hitting squeaky toys all around, that is very repetitive, but makes you want to keep coming back everytime."
127871314,english,0,1097150,"Played over 300 hours and it used to be a lot of fun. The devs have always taken questionable paths regarding level rotation and game updates in general, but since the Epic takeover this game has dropped into the bin.   Same maps day in day out, bearing in mind there are around 100 potential levels to choose from, yet hardly ever get to play them (some of which seem to have been permanently discarded).  Mundane season changes which again force monotonous rotation ad nauseum.  Terrible take over by EpicGames which means frequently you can't even play the game when the servers are down, and also a freemium content model which removes the ability to earn anything worthwhile in the game such as  new costumes, as these have become accessible only for real money. You can still use the in-game currency to buy backpacks and shoes though, so there you go. woo.  Disgrace."
84528738,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Fall Guys[/h1] With a massive cheating problem the first half of the 1st season it was pretty much unwinnable. After upgrading their anti-cheat it became much more enjoyable as you could win a few games. Sadly with that rough start and to slow content additions (if any at first), a lot of players left the game. It is the main problem with a game like Fall Guys, it gets old playing the same maps constantly. Season 2 had mediocre content, but Season 3 is by far the best season so far seen to content.  Fall Guys also suffers a lot from haters and labeling. The game is not Dead by any means and it people still spam and try to massively downplay the game, a lto havent even tried it... As goes with the labeling it isnt a casual game at all. Play with your little children and they will most likely fail to qualify from the first round and a lot of players statistically havent even won a full episode once. While skill is needed, it is very RNG dependant. To make it even worse there is a clear adv/disadvantage between players. Players are not affected by collision, grabbing and phisics equally. This explains why so few have less than 20 wins. The game greatly rewards skilled players, especially those with advantage. Notice that golden person that is ungrabbable, that can walk into you moving you a long while if you do it you wont move them an inch. Do you fall more often and take much longer to get up? Just watch a top player stream and compare your game, I can say mine isnt the same as theirs...  So to summerize some things the game has a good community, lots of haters and heavily rewards the top 1% of the game, it is probably fun for most people for a while, but many wont last even 5-10 hours. Since they have episode varriations now I mostly play when good structured ones appear like the recent Hex-a-gone only one so I dont get bored.  Ignoring bad phisics, adv/dis etc. the game suffers from some other problems aswell. For instance some people have a lot of disconnects and team games suffer from balancing when te teams are uneven. If your side is losing you dont get punished at all from leaving early and solidifying a loss for the team, 3 team games many teams end by simply having 2 teams gang up against one team which the game has no mechanics to balance against. Lastly, for some reason they have an achievement for winning 5 episodes in a row. Devs WTF, are you serious? Disconnects break the streak aswell and early people used exploit to get it by leaving if they werent sure they would win to keep the streak...  In conclusion the game is fun, for a while but grows old rather quicky. It doesnt take that long to finish the season pass and has been easier with each season. Better players with not too much disadv get waaay more rewarded than other player with much higher playtimes and can usuallly buy everything constantly in the shop (cosmetics).  I recommend Fall Guys since it provides a good amount of fun and suits a lot of different people. I hope they further balance the game between bad and good players, it doesnt really make much sense pitting the best against the worst in a battle royal and denying many players the ability to get a single win. The biggest issue of being vastly unfair between players hopefully will get smaller as they keep optimizing and polishing the game.  //ECE//"

Only difference was that all competitors didn't had to go through the obstacle parcours all at once, and this is what this game makes so much fun,  Imagine 60 players all together trying to be the first to squeese through a moving door, or how you will always fail to balance a platform to move to the next.

I would say there are <5 of the mini games that are truly fun to play. Everyone hates the team games, the tail grab games are finicky with servers, and levels like see-saw are incredibly boring if you're in the front and pointless if you're in the back.   This game is a great idea and has a ton of potential to be a fun party game, but the devs have some serious work in front of them to keep this game from being hot for a month and gone forever."

Unless someone grab you and push you down to the slime water below and you get eliminated.... :P [/b]  If you ever watched Wipeout show, where you laughing at people that get hit in the head, get throw objects at and fall down to the water, Fall Guys is kinda like that, except this time you are the one that laughing at yourself and someone else is probably laughing at you... :P    Fall Guys is a really fun competitive online game, recommend to check it out, it is funny and enjoyable to play alone or with a group of friends, this is my first competitive game that I actually enjoy ... for keep falling and fail. xD I can assure you that everyone will have a good fun here. ♥"
74881907,english,1,1097150,"Have you ever wondered what shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle would look like in Video Game form? Say hello to Fall Guys since that’s essentially what it is, and boy is it fun.  [h1]What I like:[/h1]  + Fall Guys has a wide variety of games that provide their own set of challenges. They’re not all brilliant, but they stand out and are entertaining. Some people say there aren’t enough games, but personally I think there’s enough to justify the price.  + Fall Guys isn’t a complex game. Each level has a simple goal, whether it being to jump over obstacles or bash through the right door and reach the finish line. The overall objective is to qualify each round until you reach the final round for the ultimate victory. Given time, anyone can pick this up and eventually win a game.     + The game has a colourful art style that is very effective at luring people in and hiding how frustrating the game can be. The visual design of the levels, although simple, is nice to look at, and the character designs are iconic.   + The game is challenging. Fall Guys will inevitably get you angry at some point, whether it’ll be because of the wacky physics or somebody getting in the way. It’s both the silliness and the competitiveness that make this game really fun to play.  + As well as being challenging, it’s also addicting. Sure, it doesn’t take long to end up playing the same games again and again but that didn’t bother me much because each round felt different. It’s all dependant on who you’re put up against.   + There is a vast amount of customisation items for your character, ranging from colours, patterns and outfits. The devs regularly introduce cross over events with other games. At the time of writing, they have done TF2, Portal 2 and Enter the Gungeon. There is also a free battle pass that gives you cosmetics as you progress.          [h1]What I don’t like:[/h1]  - Team games are definitely hit or miss. Sometimes they’re great. Sometimes they’re awful. The problem is that people leave as soon as their team is losing, screwing over the people who are trying. I don’t mind team games, but it would be nice if there could be two types of match searches; one type being solo games only, and the other being a mix of the two.  - I can’t say I like the tail games. The hitboxes for them seem really inconsistent. There were times where I should’ve grabbed the tail but the game failed to detect it. That or I’m just really bad. It could be that.  - Although not as bad as they used to be, server issues are still prevalent. Disconnects and lag spikes will happen every so often. Speed hackers and cheaters are also a problem. Yes people hack in this game, it's incredible really.   [h1]My Overall Thoughts:[/h1]  Fall Guys has become insanely popular since release and I can understand why. It’s a unique take on a battle royale that manages to make the genre enjoyable to people who despise it. The fact that it still has a massive playerbase shows that the devs did many things right.  As I mentioned before, it’s the silliness and competitiveness in each round that make this game enjoyable and memorable. It’s meant to be frustrating. It’s meant to be over the top. And it’s really damn fun. The game has a charm that I personally haven’t seen much of in multiplayer games.  That being said, the game is far from perfect. Fall Guys had a rough launch server wise and still has a way to go. It also has a hacker problem which is in the process of being fixed. The game still needs some new features such as advanced searches as well as tweaks to already existing game modes.   Fall Guys isn’t necessarily a game you will play for a prolonged period of time, but it’s a brilliant pick if you want something to spend the time. It’s great on your own and it’s great with friends, and with its current price tag, I’d say it’s worth it.

96308081,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is one of the most enjoyable online gaming experiences. With simple controls, heaps of fun, replayable mini-games and customizations (paid or won) that do not alter the gameplay, and a catchy background tune, Fall Guys has everything that causes addictive play. Indeed, even when you are eliminated, there is the immediate urge to hop back in and try your luck again. The only thing that lets Fall Guys down is the inability to play local matches against friends on your couch. The vibrant levels, with their inflatable-like obstacles and moving platforms wouldn’t be out of place on a TV game show. Indeed, I’m now looking forward to the Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout TV adaption, where players must don Fall Guy suits and compete in a similar series of wacky and enjoyable events. Until then, Fall Guys will be my multiplayer game of choice."
92550457,english,1,1097150,"If you asked me if I'd recommend this game when it first came out, I'd say no. Back then, it was pretty much the same 10 minigames over and over, which got boring REALLY fast.   But now, as of the time I'm writing this (season 4.5) there are 46 different minigames, and that number doesn't include the fact that many minigames have random variations that might change up the game significantly, so really the amount of UNIQUE minigames is probably up in the hundreds. Now I can play for an hour and barely see any repeat minigames, which was basically impossible when this game first launched.   TL:DR The game used to be boring, but now it isn't since the devs added (and are continuing to add) a bunch of new minigames which helps keep it fresh.  Plus the music has no right being that good"
79841325,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” burst onto the gaming scene with a splash in August 2020, capturing the hearts of players with its unique blend of chaotic fun and colorful, whimsical aesthetics. Developed by Mediatonic, this battle royale-style party game quickly became a cultural phenomenon, celebrated for its vibrant graphics, quirky challenges, and family-friendly appeal. Unfortunately, despite its initial success, “Fall Guys” is no longer available on Steam, leaving many fans longing for its return on the platform.[/b]  [h1]Gameplay and Appeal[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” offers a delightful twist on the battle royale genre, replacing the intense combat with a series of absurdly fun mini-games and obstacle courses. Players control customizable jellybean-like characters as they navigate through increasingly difficult rounds, all while avoiding elimination. The game's charm lies in its accessibility; anyone can pick up and play, making it a great choice for both casual gamers and those seeking a lighthearted competitive experience.  The vibrant, cartoonish art style and upbeat soundtrack create an inviting atmosphere, enhancing the enjoyment of its frenetic gameplay. Each round is a chaotic spectacle, where strategy and timing blend with a healthy dose of luck. Whether you're dodging swinging hammers or leaping across precarious platforms, the sheer unpredictability of each match ensures that no two games are ever the same.[/b]  [h1]The Hype[/h1]  [b]At launch, “Fall Guys” was met with widespread enthusiasm and quickly garnered a dedicated player base. Its appeal was amplified by its engaging, easy-to-learn gameplay and the ability to play with friends, which made it a popular choice for streamers and content creators. The game's success was further fueled by regular updates, seasonal events, and collaborations with various franchises, which kept the content fresh and exciting.[/b]  [h1]The Downfall[/h1]  [b]Despite its early success, “Fall Guys” faced significant challenges over time. One of the major issues was the server instability and connectivity problems that plagued players, particularly during peak times or after major updates. These technical difficulties detracted from the overall experience and led to frustration among the player base.  More critically, the decision to remove “Fall Guys” from Steam was a disappointing turn for many. The game transitioned to a free-to-play model and launched on other platforms, including Epic Games Store, which led to its withdrawal from Steam. This shift was met with mixed reactions, as it left a portion of the community unable to access the game through their preferred platform.  The transition also meant that future updates and new content were no longer available to Steam users, diminishing the game's visibility and impact on the platform. While the game’s cross-platform functionality ensured that players on other platforms could still enjoy it, the Steam community was left feeling somewhat abandoned.[/b]  [h1]Conclusion[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” remains a memorable entry in the gaming landscape, celebrated for its whimsical charm and engaging gameplay. While the decision to remove the game from Steam was a blow to many fans, the game's legacy endures through its continued presence on other platforms and the fond memories it created during its peak.[/b]  [i]The game’s hype was well-deserved, as it brought a fresh and entertaining twist to the battle royale genre. However, the challenges it faced, particularly the platform transition and technical issues, highlight the difficulties of maintaining momentum in a highly competitive market. For those who experienced its glory days on Steam, “Fall Guys” will always be a beloved reminder of the fun and chaos of its unique gameplay.[/i]"
79018450,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys is really fun! I've just picked up the game a few months after release, and while there was a stumbling block in doing well due to the skill of other players (and the fact that I suck at video games in general), I've managed to make it pretty far and have a lot of fun. Don't believe anyone who says this game is dying! It may not be meme-level status anymore but it's still very fun and has lots of players."
77164093,english,1,1097150,"enjoying it quite much. i didnt see any cheaters in my game in my whole session so the anti-cheat is working well. don't like how some rounds have RNG elements but 'tis but a fun little game.  edit: I was waiting for season 2 to appear before I can write this but I have a major issue with server outages. I keep getting disconnected from servers and I face with heavy desyncs. Also, server availability for asia in general is really bad. at around 1:30am my time, the matchmaking goes into forever loop and I can't find anyone. So make your decision according to this.  good game but servers are not good.  edit 2: still same the same issue (27/11/20)"
74796725,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Not worth the Price[/h1]  + Very cute visually with vibrant colors + The events are mostly well designed and fun + Addictive replayability trying to someday be #1 + Great fun to see 60 players competing at the start of each game   - Not enough events. Even as a new player, after a few games you will be repeating events, after about 10 games you will have experienced everything this game has to offer. - Starts to feel a bit repetitive after about 1 hour (in my experience) - In-game cash shop   Overall, is it fun? Yes, for a limited short time.  With the current amount of content available within Fall Guys, I would have priced this game at around $5.  If they decide to add (A LOT) more content later on, than perhaps this game is justifiable at $20, but currently I wouldn't imagine playing Fall Guys for more than about 2 hours.   *Voted Positive, because the game is truly fun, and I don't want to bash it just for the price*"
94862122,english,0,1097150,"This is a hard review to make as I have a mixed feeling about the game overall. I've stuck with it ever since Season 1 and never really stopped playing it except for Season 3. You could say I just really, really want the game of this type to succeed.  What pulls me in is the unique [strike]tournament style[/strike] battle royale gameplay you have. It's just a bunch of minigames (47 as of writing of this) that you face randomly. The pull of this game for me is that you can play solo, that it's a platformer-ish BR and that it creates unique combos of levels every match. The first few rounds are often easy, not punishing and include quite a bit of random. For example - Door Dash is pretty much RNG - you slam against doors and hope they're not fake. Pretty RNG if you ask me, but it only spawns with at least 40 players, which you are very likely not to be at after round 2. On the other hard, the finals are supposed to be hard, skill-testing experiences, because only one winner emerges and that winner wins the whole show.  The problems arise when you actually take more than 2 seconds to look at the game. Back when this game first released, PC had a massive cheater problem which persisted for ~40 days until they finally released a mid-season patch. At that point most mainstream players weren't even playing anymore. This is an example of how horrible Mediatonic (the devs) are at game polish. This game has had constant polish issues. Season 4's release was a bugfest - they introduced the new Squads Show (which I liked), but it was very buggy - almost as if the devs never even tested it, or tested it with such strange priorities, that they only ever cared about fixing the game-breaking bugs. Speaking of priorities, I find Mediatonic a strange outlier in this category as well - most developers, for example, Mojang with Minecraft, push out multiple bug fix updates after their newest release to make sure that players have the least buggy experience before starting work on new features. That's not how it works for Mediatonic! Every season, they appear to have this cycle: * Season drops - new features, meaning new bugs * One hotfix a few days later or a week later (at least the one that the community gets notified about) * A lot of time passes * Mid-season patch - fixes bugs AND adds new features (new bugs) * More time passes * Repeat I assume Mediatonic is on a time crunch or something, because they are trying to dish out new features as quickly as possible...  Asides from polish, the design of the game is questionable as well. The most distinct and unique features of Fall Guys is what you play as - you play as beans which are designed with kinda strange physics. They can fall over, get hit, stretch (visually) and flip over... but they can also get flung or... just act strange and unpredictable. Fall Guys doesn't offer solid server sync. I've never seen myself get teleported or re-synced with the server somehow - the server doesn't control any of that. What this means is Fall Guys has one of the worst desync I've seen of all games. You can be sure that most of the players you see on your screen are actually at least a bit ahead. Near the end of races, I often see players disappear off the map BEFORE they cross the line. The problem with this is when you play tail tag games and Jinxed, where the game OBJECTIVE, depends on something that's desynced... Luckily it's usually not THAT bad. I pretty much never had strong issues with Tail Tag, Royal Fumble and games like that. What's more annoying is the more prevalent mechanic - GRABBING. Grabbing is the strongest mechanic when it comes to interacting with players. What's annoying about it, is that you can get grabbed by a desynced player who looks like he's really behind you (on whose screen you're closer to them). When that happens, you will literally get flung backwards against your win and then stuck for a bit... It's also annoying because the duration for which you get stuck appears to be random. Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's long. Also, if you are the one to grab a player, you also kind of get stuck. It's annoying because when you stop holding the key to grab, there's a noticeable delay to get unstuck from the grabbing position. This is a flimsy mechanic that is now integral to the game, giving the game it's own 'feel', which really sucks, because it's often frustrating to many players and is the main way to grief other players. I get that there needs to be a way to interact with others, but I really wish it was less annoying than that. There are even more issues with desync, but I don't think Steam can handle my review to be much longer....  I know I've said that Fall Guys seems to pertain a pattern where the first rounds are easy and kinda random, while last rounds require skill, but really isn't the reality - it's just a pattern people WANT to see. There are currently 6 finals in the game. The final that requires the most skill is Jump Showdown, but on paper it sounds really boring - it's just a final version of Jump Club with a top and bottom 2-sided baton, where the bottom baton speeds up over 5 minutes that the round lasts. The only other thing about the final that is unique, is that its floor divided into 8 parts is slowly destroyed down to 2, limiting your running space (and introducing unfair RNG that is STILL not fixed!). That sounds boring... but unfortunately simple rounds are like that are somewhat common in Fall Guys (which in my opinion isn't an issue that much). What's the issue are the other finals. I don't have strong issues with Royal Fumble, though people considered it the worst final. My issue is with finals like Fall Mountain or as I like to call it ""RNG Mountain"". The game is a climb upwards with very unpredictable elements determined by RNG. Due to lack of autonomy over your characters, it's often impossible to dodge or gain a benefit from oncoming projectiles. In my opinion this was the worst final until Season 4.5, where they managed to outdo themselves somehow. Mediatonic, on a quest to add more variations, decided to add low gravity to (the overrated) Hex-A-Gone and Thin Ice... this turned them into the most boring finals ever. Because everyone has very large jumping range and all of it is very slow, it becomes child's play until the final moment of the final. At that final moment, the only thing that impacts the result is who jumps LAST and spends the most time midair. That's the winner! That's it! Who thought this was a good idea? I understand the will to add more variations, but there are so many better ways to do it! How about you change the positions of hexes? How about you make interesting layers out of them??? Or what about making special new types of hexes that do something? There are so many things you could do but you didn't bother... What's also upsetting is the choice of what Mediatonic chooses to even add in each season. Consider the fact that every single season since release had ALWAYS added new Team games... you know, the game archetype that MOST players hate??? From noobs to pros, most HATE Team games. They are only good in Squads Shows imo. Team is arguably one of the biggest archetypes in the game with most rounds, while also being the most hated type of game. Season 3 is the only season to have added new Finals. What's upsetting is that these 'new' Finals are just Final reskins of already existing games! They added Roll Off, which is the final version of Roll Out and they added Thin Ice, a more boring variation of Hex-A-Gone... That's how creative they are despite the constant streams of suggestions they opened up for themselves, they couldn't come up with anything more original.  I'll end this review here for now. There are more issues with the game, like the controversies Mediatonic had with exclusive skins, worrying monetization and Mediatonic's belligerence with trackers. I still like the game and really wish it improved... 6/10"

80550533,english,1,1097150,"Look here me out, This game is a masterpiece as it allows for casual players to have fun, but also rewards more competitive gamers with the allure of a battle royale. It can seem repetitive to some people but the silliness of it all keeps you hooked. Some people may get frustrated by the randomness of certain rounds (team battles) but it is easy to jump back in and try again. The microtransactions aren't intrusive and are very rewarding for low prices, so people who are willing to spend can get the best value out of it. The battle pass is even free! And the soundtrack just fills you with an adrenaline rush. Overall, this game is for those who value fun over competition and winning and it really pays off to just enjoy it. Have fun falling!"

81782830,english,1,1097150,"You might not like it, but this is what peak Battle Royale looks like.  The level design is based on the idea that each level is 50% skill and 50% random. So, there will be chaos, and frustration, but also this will create some hilarious moments. More than once I have found myself actually laughing out loud.  I think the graphics are neat, and you can have some funny costumes for your bean; all the while listening to a soundtrack that just fits.  The only real problem with the game is its netcode, this creates a lot of situations that feel, and are, unfair.   Rating: Fail guys.  *Editors' Pick* https://pixelloot.com"
154350608,english,0,1097150,Epic ruins games  Bought this game for $20 before epic had anything to do with it and my progress was taken because I changed my linked epic account
87075938,english,0,1097150,"This is a good game to play with a group of 3 other friends, and it's can be a good game for children.  Other than that, this game was Game of The Month in August of 2020.  Sadly, Fall Guys gets very repetitive, as the algorithm that decides which level you play will often give you the same levels over and over again. Not to mention if you are playing the game by yourself, it can be very frustrating as every player(as well as the level) is working against you, and no one is working with you.  There was a time during season 1 when Fall Guys actually favored those who were skilled at the game. Sadly they eventually started changing it so that there were so many obstacles that skill no longer will help you much with winning as it once did. And even when there weren't so many obstacles to get in your way, there used to be hackers in season one to keep you from winning. Apparently Mediatonic thought it was fine to replace hackers with moving obstacles to keep this game from being at all skill based when it comes to winning. This is one of the few games that I know of where you can get good at the game and never win a crown by actually winning. I know so many people who have played this game, only to get second place, and never first.  Honestly, the most disappointing part of Fall Guys isn't even anything I just listed. The most disappointing part of it, that I find, is that at most, there are only 2 game modes at any given time. I remember how when everyone I knew was playing this game would talk about how awesome it would be if at least streamers could organize their own games with 60 or less players from their chats. Sadly, this game doesn't get much added to it, other than skins. Yeah, there are just a few new levels every season, but not much changes about this game, as it is largely luck based and is a waste of time for players like myself.  All in all, this game was over-hyped and likely will not stand the test of time. I don't recommend it to anyone looking for a good game, unless they like repetitiveness."
107946780,english,0,1097150,"If you want to get into this game, I recommend looking into some of these features within the game before making your judgement. This post will be a cumulative list of the worst of Fall Guys, and will go on for a while, so be warned.  Going into this list, I want you to keep two key facts in mind. Number one, take into consideration this quote, in its absolution, no edits, no paraphrasing, from the March 2nd, 2021 official Mediatonic release about their acquisition by Epic Games:  [quote=Mediatonic]""Joining forces with Epic will accelerate our plans to improve the game and bring Fall Guys to as many players as possible, while continuing to support the community.""[/quote]  Second, consider the fact that most, if not all, of the clips I will be sharing were delivered [b]on level release[/b]. Some of these features date back to the game's early months. I want you to consider this: an error in the game that lasts a couple of weeks is a bug, a hitch in the experience. If that issue persists into month durations, that's no longer a bug. That's the experience the developers want you to be having while playing this game.

Improving the game, and supporting the community. Allowing players to experience the true, undeterred Fall Guys experience that Mediatonic wants you to experience when you play the game.   I ask you, though. Surely if these were to be considered bugs and glitches, then Mediatonic would absolutely take time to remedy these issues, and if these were issues to begin with, then keeping them within the game for several months and counting means that the community is [i]wrong[/i], and these are indeed the improvements promised to us with the newly acquired resources necessary to bring the game to its best potential.  All of the links I provided aren't just occasional [strike]bugs[/strike] features that have blipped in and out throughout Fall Guys' lifespan. These have and have always appeared consistently and throughout the game's whole entire lifespan, and have never once been taken out of the game. At best, these can be considered controversial additions to gameplay, and at worst, these are haphazard displays of lack of support and a disconnect from the community to sustain the game properly.   I absolutely adore this game, and have grudged through its tenure in my library balancing the good and the bad. I've been through its original fad status, the lack of updates and disappointing Season 2, the savior of Squads mode reincarnating the game, the custom playlist cycles, and have been a day 1 player in each and every new season. After hundreds of hours, I can definitely mark my feelings down in this review. This is a good game with a horrible company, not malicious or evil, but absurdly lazy to the point that the most dedicated players aren't here just cause they're good - it's that these above experiences are so integrated into daily gameplay that at this point we just don't care anymore."
85835494,english,1,1097150,"this is a great game it has grown tremendously so let me enlighten those people who dropped the game halfway through season one.  1. repetition: the minigames are more diverse than ever, there are so many more minigames than in season 1, especially with the new update. Every show is different from one another especially with all the new side shows.  2. glitches: REDUCED TO ZERO, there are practically no more glitches in season 3 making the playing field even for everyone  3. cost: The cost is much more worth it! multiplayer is more enjoyable, and you get way more minigames and fun for your precious money, I assure you, $20 is a very good price  To sum it up this game is very good, if any of you dropped the game and have not played since season 1, you should change that."
74498736,english,0,1097150,Too many hackers ruin such a silly game.  Only takes one in a batch of 60 to ruin all the fun.  I doubt it will change so unless you like backing out of half the games then I wouldn't spend $20 on this.

When I bought the game, an account for Epic was not needed. The recent changes mean I can  now no longer play Fall Guys and I will not accept an Epic account being linked to my Steam account.  I refuse to link my Steam account with Epic due to it being nothing more than a privacy invasion and a massive data-grab of Steam users.  When I purchase a game I do so taking the risk whether it is bad or not, that I accept, but to bring in account linking and passing information to another separate service AFTER my purchase, thereby changing my aggreement, that's just plain wrong."

This game is really fun... for the first 3-4 days. Once you get the initial hype out of it, the game just becomes repetetive and annoying. Once you get your first win, the game just becomes completely stale. Even with the new maps, I find myself playing cheap knockoffs more often than the actual game. For a ""chill"" game, most of the stages are just unreasonable punishing and extremely difficult to get any practice in. If you like that and have the budget, go ahead. But if you re just looking for a relaxing challenge to sink some hours into, this game is really just a waste of money. I did enjoy this game, but only for about 5 hours."

97165034,english,1,1097150,"You know, sometimes people ask me why I chose to get Fall Guy plastic surgery and I can't really give them an answer. It's not because I'm afraid they'll dislike me or think I'm a freak or anything, it's that I just can't pinpoint an answer. I mean, yeah, the sexual attraction was always there, but I don't think that's really it. My dad was an alcoholic. He was never really there, he was always wasting his time and money at the bar. Before he left for the bar, he would always tell me, ""You stay there and play those games and if you're not there when I get back… well boy, there'll be hell to pay"". So I played video games. My favorite game was Fall Guys. I just loved that bean; the way he talked, the way he sang and dance. It was great. I… I guess I looked at Fall Guy as the father I never had. I mean, he taught me how to ride a bike, he taught me how to swim, he taught me everything. But I didn't just want to be LIKE Fall Guy, I wanted to BE him. Well, here I am, Fall Guy. This is me, this is who I was born to be."

119268215,english,0,1097150,"Epic Games had to ruin everything. Removed the game from Steam, made it free and added microtransactions. Players that bought the game received awful rewards for buying it after it got free to play, and all the crowns we earned were turned into Kudos, a currency that is now obsolete because Epic created their own currency, the Show Bucks. Now most of the items use this new coin that players can only get by spending money, making the game less fun to play. In the past Players could get most skins if they were skilled enough for free, but now 80% of the good skins need to be paid with an exaggerated price, these skins are way to expensive for what they are worth especially considering they were obtainable with the old currency of the game that was free and could be earned by just playing it. It is so ironic that players that pre-ordered the game received a Gordon Freeman skin, a character made by Valve the creator of Steam, for the game now leaving Steam and join Rocket League on one of the worst Gaming Companies possible. I really feel betrayed with the decisions of the game devs because I always supported the game even in awful situations like the cheating problem, now to see everything *fall* apart, very sad to know that money can change anyone and make the worst mistakes ever. Last but not least I don't understand how people could accept this situation, why should these type of decisions should be accepted nowadays, if something like this happened in 2012 people would riot for a change, but nowadays it is something normal that people are used to, sadly. This may be the biggest reason why I prefer old games, no lazy unfinished products at day 1, no microtransactions, just a simple good game with good unlockables FOR FREE. Gaming companies are greedy and will want more, and in the future things will be way worse. We really shouldn't accept these actions, but sadly I guess we're too late. I miss the old days when everything was simple."

75082098,english,1,1097150,"Here's what I see in this game: potential. Is it the best designed game out there? No. Is it the best multiplayer game out there? No. Is it the best optimized game out there (at least at the time of writing)? No. But what it does have is an amazing base game that's incredibly addicting. Even for the $20 its selling for, which in my opinion is a bit high, it's still a fantastic game that is incredibly fun to play with a group of friends.  Obviously there's a lot missing here: private multiplayer, custom matches, the lack of maps, actually being able to use your own name (lol), and the crackdown on cheating (to be completely fair I haven't encountered any). If you're skeptical about the game, I wouldn't blame you for waiting for it to go on sale or waiting until more content is added. We've seen this song and dance before: games release with a bare bones experience that's wildly fun, but gets old fast. That being said, I hope the developers continue to make this game better and better. Cut them some slack too, they got flooded with a player base they couldn't have expected. Let them get back on their feet after the floodgates opened, and show us what they can do.  Please keep going devs, I'm having a ton of fun so far but it's got a bit of a ways before it's really amazing. 8/10."
98256210,english,1,1097150,Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.  It's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!
74696182,english,1,1097150,"The Devolverland Expo led me to Fall Guys.  I was a little reluctant to get involved in a Battle Royale style game as I generally suck at competitive play but the sheer gleeful hilarity of this game more than makes up for the frustrations.  Are there server issues?  Sure.  Are there filthy filthy cheaters?  Oh you know it!  Am I still terrible?  Hoo boy am I ever.  Is it filled with bright colours, upbeat music, snappy mini games and lovable characters all bumbling their way to victory or slime?   Yes, yes it is and I love it.   +++UPDATE+++  So now I've played for, gee forty hours, seriously?  In that time I have managed to win two episodes.  Bear in mind I am terrible.  Two victories out of hundreds of failures.  Sweet sweet victories.  This sounds like a pretty bad ratio but really each victory feels truly momentous especially considering the ever increasing number of cheating hackers.  The cheating was something I could overlook when it was rare, but now it is the norm and it is really making me lose interest.  This is supposed to be Fall Guys, NOT Fly Guys.  There is very little competitive edge when you know the dude who is hovering above the level is going to automatically win!  I am now at the grinding stage just trying to collect the rest of the cosmetics for the season.    The initial shine has definitely dulled, and unless Mediatonic add some kind of anti cheat, this is going to quickly lose the large casual audience.  We shall see what Season 2 brings, but if the hackers are going to be allowed to continue operating I don't see myself joining the ranks of hopeful suckers never able to get a legitimate win.   ===UP-UPDATE===  So now I'm deeper than sixty hours in and Mediatonic have indeed listened to the criticisms levelled at their tiny little behemoth of a game.  There is now an anti cheat running in the background, which I know has been a bone of contention in some other releases (hello DOOM: Eternal) but it was desperately needed here and to be fair, I haven't happened upon any filthy dirty hackers since.  So now I can get back to being terrible through my own volition.  There has also been a refreshing of the levels.  A remixing of sorts.  The old tried and tested games have been given a lick of fresh paint and are all just a little bit different.  Clockwise rotating beams now might rotate anti-clockwise.  Wrecking balls that swung along the x axis now might swing along the y axis.  And there are random spinning hammers all over the shop.  It has definitely breathed fresh life into the game and really all my previous complaints have now been addressed.  Jolly well played there chaps.  Good form indeed.  Right, I'm off back to my glorious upbeat technicolour failure..."
117568023,english,0,1097150,"Once again, Epic Games sticks their greedy fingers into anything they can get their hands on. Their recent overhaul monetizes the hell out of the game, and they've screwed over long time players.  1. You're no longer able to get rare skins through playing the game alone, you now have to pay. The free currency (that was already a decent grind to get) can only be used to buy common stuff now.  2. Previously, crowns were typically used to purchase rare skins. They were only obtained through high placement, or very slowly through leveling. Now that crowns have been removed, there is far less incentive to actually grind and get good at the game.  3. Skins that used to be event exclusive are now being sold in the shop, which is unfair for anyone who had them.  4. Old legendary color skins are now common/rare, which is also unfair for those who had them.  It's been a good run, but I'm through with this game. There's literally nothing to play for anymore. I cant even finish the last achievement on my steam list without forking out cash, even though I ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME.  I hated Epic Games with a passion before this, and somehow they continue to find ways to remind me to keep hating them."

How can they remove it off the steam store, take away the crowns we earned added micro transaction instead of just earning the skins through playing. I remember when I could feel a sense of achievement by winning. stacking my crowns to buy skins.  None of this is the case now. It's just a corporate shell of a game which once had integrity.   I will never forget the betrayal"
148095686,english,0,1097150,"""Fall Guys is a free, cross-platform massively multiplayer party royale game"" ""Fall Guys is no longer available on the Steam Store""  Epic Games bought out Fall Guys and immediately pulled it from Steam because they didn't like that they had to give a cut of the profits to Steam. Then they made a PAID GAME into a free to play game, modifying the cosmetic shop so you can buy the cosmetics with real money (which degrades the value of the cosmetics, seeing as they were originally earned with crowns) and adding a battlepass with a premium track.  The game has since been going downhill. I really must wonder at what point developers will learn to not let Epic Games buy them out, and I'm also wondering when people will stop giving money to a corporation that clearly hates them.  Thanks Epic Games, for ruining another good game."

155864927,english,0,1097150,"Epic ruined this game. Took all the early adopters who paid $20, and essentially gave them the middle finger.  Skins that you used to be able to earn just by playing the game and getting wins are now $10-$20. Sucked all the fun out of the game."
98963553,english,1,1097150,"I've spent a ton of time playing this game, so I want to do my best to give an honest review of the game and do it justice.  A basic explanation on what the game is, would be a colorful and eye-popping battle royal style game that includes a multitude of different rounds to play - including solo race rounds, puzzle rounds, and skill based rounds. Team rounds are also a staple of the game play, pairing you up with random players in your lobby to work towards a common goal. However, there is only one crown, and therefore can only be one winner! In some cases there can be multiple winners, but for this to happen you have to have cooperation with the rest of the lobby and some skill in order to time out rounds.  The game play feels choppy at times, is the best way I can describe it. The crowd physics in the game, regarding interacting with other players through running into their character or grabbing them for different purposes, has from day one been an ongoing issue. While some games you can play with no issues and great server connection, other games will have you frustrated, especially in game modes requiring the grabbing aspect to either steal tails, hold Pegwins or trying to fight back against someone trying to grief you. I feel like it'll forever be an issue in the game, because the problem seems to be much deeper than just a simple patch can fix. I understand that this issue can be a deal breaker for new players, and I want to reiterate that it will become a problem for every player at some point.  For a game that looks colorful and fun and simple to play, there is a strong competitive player base that makes the games much more difficult for unsuspecting players. There are some people who will be able to pick up the game quickly and roll with the punches, but for most players there is a learning curve involved. I'm currently, as of this review, still under 600 crowns in total with 900 hours of playtime. I personally enjoy playing the game with friends, however, and spend a lot of time in game modes such as Squads Show and 2-3 man squads. This isn't a game that I think you can solely play competitively, and if you're going to continue coming back to the game you should find a way to have fun while playing! That can be any reason - grief other players, play with friends, or helping other players win. There's an amazing scene of streamers and players on Twitch that really got me hooked on the game, and I encourage anyone looking for other players to check out someone they like on that site! Personally I recommend DjBigRuss and CrazyyTrainn, but there are plenty of people to chat and play with!  Overall, it's a game - there will be plenty of people who enjoy it, and many others who dislike it. There's plenty of players online however, and finding a match doesn't take very long at all. With all the different levels and variations of those levels, along with an interactive media team and a development team that brings new content to the game as soon as they can. I recommend giving the game a chance at some point, if you're not willing to spend $20 for it then wait until it goes on sale. It's a wonderful game and I've met some wonderful people I don't think I would have met without this game, and it'll forever be a game that I have a ton of love for."

You wanna discover something new and refreshing in gaming that takes you away from the mindless grind of other games and give yourself a hard reset on perspective, grab a drink, grab some snacks and look no further.

73778456,english,0,1097150,"Update 9.19.20 || The devs have addressed the cheating issue and have finally added EAC, which has helped to alleviate the cheating problem. I'm still going to leave this review as it was at the time that I wrote it to stand as testament to how terrible this game was on release.   I still don't recommend this game. I have zero faith in these developers. The anticheat took far longer than it should have to be added and all the other issues with this game still remain unaddressed.   PS, usernames are STILL disabled. I'm pretty confident the developers have no intention of re-enabling them. RIP grabbing ttv streamers, it was the only truly fun thing to do in this game.   //  This game's launch has been an absolute trainwreck.  THE GAME RUNS ENTIRELY CLIENT-SIDE, which means people can blatantly speedhack with no special hack tools. The game also has NO ANTI-CHEAT, AT ALL. The closest thing to anti-cheat is a single text channel in the game's official Discord where you can manually report cheaters, which, surprise, doesn't actually get any cheaters banned.   Users were able to use HTML in their Steam username to make their names appear large or colorful in-game. I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to ""Fall Guy ####"". WHY NOT JUST FIX THE HTML IN USER'S NAMES. Let me give your programmers a hint, it's called input sanitization, you can look up a tutorial for it on YouTube and actually do your job.  So with those two problems coupled together, yeah let me just go and file a report against someone with nothing but the username ""Fall Guy 1234"" to go on—I can't even track their Steam account through recent games. Keep in mind also that this game has a million-some players and there are only 4 digits in each randomized name, so there are going to be several dozen duplicates of each numerical name. The devs couldn't track that to a player even if they wanted to, so no one is getting banned for cheating. Great work guys. It's only going to get worse as the game goes on if nothing gets fixed.   This game has the worst netcode of any game I've ever played. There's a gamemode that involves running around the map and stealing tails from other players. This minigame was copy-pasted twice to make three equally garbage modes, I've heard dozens of complains against them from friends and streamers and I don't think a single person actually enjoys playing them. Enemies with Walmart parking lot tier internet can grab you from over 10 feet away and when you attempt to grab the tail off an enemy you can see the grab icon pop up on their character and nothing happens 50% of the time. It's so inconsistent that there's almost no skill here, just pure luck.   Nobody enjoys the forced team gamemodes either. You only have a small amount of control to the outcome of team games, so winning equates to a simple game of luck based on how bad your teammates are. In addition to that, this is a physics-based game, using Unity's default physics engine. It's horrifically inconsistent and sometimes your character will simply trip over their own feet, falling down and losing the game because someone grabs your tail while you're on the floor, or you jump down a level on Hex-a-gone and your character simply trips for no reason and you fall to your death while you try to stand up. The physics make the game feel horrible to play. Half of the minigames feel like they were quickly thrown together in the last 2 weeks of development to meet quota. Especially ""Perfect Match"", the game where no one ever dies unless they're literally afk.   Only *one day* after releasing, the game's servers completely died, for absolutely everyone, for almost an entire day. They had previously been dropping constantly in the middle of games. The devs' had presumably been attempting to migrate their servers to a different host with a larger capacity, but apparently failed to do so and were being very secretive as to why. They had announced a maintenance would begin at 6:00 am, but randomly decided to begin six hours early at peak player count time and gave no ETA for when it would be finished. The ""maintenance"" ended up taking almost the entire day and no one could play the game the entire time. When the game first officially released they deliberately avoided announcing the time that the game would unlock. They also avoided notifying players when the servers were back online after the ""maintanance"". They clearly knew the servers would choke on the first day and didn't fix the servers in the three day period before the game launched, or, you know, several months before, they had ample reason to predict this would be a problem but did nothing.    My favorite part of it all is that the developers are BLAMING THE PLAYERS for their problems. On Twitter they blamed the players when the servers went over capacity, clearly their fault, and they blamed the players when users used html in their names, also clearly their own fault. Fix your game.   The game has a separate Twitter account for the server status. Not only has the account constantly lied about the status of the servers, in addition to claiming they ""would tweet when the servers are back online"" and then didn't, I thought it was pretty hilarious that the main Twitter playfully posted something along the lines of ""Look how many people are following our server account!"". Yeah, no, they're not following that because they want to hear your awful hello-fellow-kids tweets, they're doing it because they want to know when the servers are going to be back online for the game they all paid $20 for.    The devs had MONTHS to beta test this game and somehow bafflingly didn't catch on to the fact that the servers wouldn't have enough capacity to handle the amount of players on launch. Or fix the broken netcode. Or add anticheat. Or fix html in usernames. Or rework the bad minigames. I refuse to believe this kind of stuff wasn't caught in QA, which means either there was no QA, or the devs just ignored the feedback.    I've never seen a company shoot themselves in the foot and handle success so poorly.  And to the people claiming that this is excusable because ""they're just a small indie company"", it isn't, because they're not. They have 230 employees and have existed since 2005. This is pure incompetence. I don't see this game lasting past its first season."
80884289,english,1,1097150,"I've had Fall Guys for a while now, and while the game now is merely a shadow of what it once was during it's first month of release, that doesn't take away from the fact that Fall Guys is a really great game to kill some time or play with friends. The gameplay is fun yet slightly challenging and the different courses are very reminiscent of those TV shows I used to watch as a kid. That said though there are a limited number of courses you can play through and though fun for a while they get old very fast, after about 2 hours I had seen every course in the game and after playing the same courses over and over again, sometimes back to back, it started to become a drag. All in all though I still recommend Fall Guys for when you have a few spare hours to burn or for when you're with your friends and wanna get a quick laugh."

78158202,english,0,1097150,"Fall Guys, as a concept, is a wondrous spin on the battle royale genre we’ve seen in recent years. My woes, however, stem from what I’m assuming is a dev team that’s trying their best with a playerbase they never expected.   Let me preface by saying that I am absolutely in love with this game, it’s probably one of my most favorites to come out in recent years. Solo matches are what I do to turn off my brain and relax for a bit. Playing with friends can lead to many laughs and wholehearted fun- but... only when it works. This is where my first problem stems:   Matchmaking into a game when queued with others on my friends list can be super dodgy. We get matched into different games from each other entirely, some of us just drop out of our team in the menu completely out of left field, or there will be a hard disconnect while we’re playing in an ongoing match. I do note, however, the disconnection issues have gotten better since one of their season 2 patches, so I thank them for that.  Another lingering issue I have is that ever since the mid-season update during the first season, one of my friends has been falsely flagged for cheating ever since EAC has been implemented. He has exhausted every option to get a concrete answer as to why they’ve been banned since then, only to be told that they -won’t- reverse it and won’t even tell him why he was banned in the first place. I KNOW he doesn’t cheat. This is the same EAC that’s used in games like Rust and Fortnite, and he can still play those games at full capacity.  No mention of what program it could’ve been, no real explanation... nothing. I’ve been unable to play with my friend for the longest time and it makes me both upset and sad that this is still going on. So... if you’re dealt a terrible card like he was, good luck! Because for some reason they won’t tell you why or how you got banned. That’s money down the drain. No chance at a refund if you’ve been playing for awhile.  My second most frustrating ordeals are when I see Mediatonic tout brand new variations for maps that a small group of players have said are too easy/boring when adding spinning pillars or hammers should be -last- on their list. Players being bored of a single two-minute match is a non-issue. Players can ABSOLUTELY handle a dry spell of the same map if it means that the devs could spend time and resources fixing prevalent bugs that have been in the game since day one.  Some bugs and issues I can remember off the top of my head:  - Broken hoops in the hoop games where you successfully jump in them and don’t earn a point  -Grabbing the crown in Fall Mountain only for the grab to not register at all, so you fall and someone else grabs the crown. Sometimes I would literally be dangling on the crown because I haven’t let go for a good few seconds in hopes that it will register my win, but then someone else runs in and gets the win instead  -Falling in-between the middle of three hexagons in Hex-a-Gone because the velocity messes with your bean, thus falling onto the levels below, or just getting eliminated immediately into the slime  -Jumping on a “crack” between two adjacent platforms in Jump Showdown and having my input get eaten, so my bean just simply doesn’t jump and I get swept away  -Minor (but annoying) issues like where my bean will be placed if I fall in a weird zone during one of the gauntlet levels (ex: in Whirlygig with the middle shortcut with the fan at the end, if you fall in a very particular place surrounding it, the game sets you up at the very BEGINNING of the map. So trigger zones or respawn placements really desparately need to be looked at.)  I don’t want to leave a negative review because I know game dev work is a lot. I’m leaving one (and hopefully, just for now) in the hopes that this gets read and passed along.   Your playerbase doesn’t need new big yeetuses, it needs answers and relief from some of the bugs that hinder the very core of your game on a near-daily basis.   Us players can wait for new mechanics and silly shenanigans, but everything I listed above is also just some of the several handfuls of bugs and problems I’ve encountered so far, and I know I’m not the only player with these issues. A quick look on the most popular Fall Guys subreddit will show you similar complaints, too.  I’ve amassed many hours into this game and probably over 90-100 wins currently, so know that my issues come from a place of wanting to see this game thrive. I adore Fall Guys, you have something lovely in your hands, so all I hope is that you devote some love back into the facets that need it most right now. As much as I want more people to get into this game, it’s hard to recommend it in its current state. While I may be patient with its many bugs and disconnects, there is also many others who will leave the game flat because of it.  You can do better, just by re-focusing on what’s important. I hope I can change my review in the future, but please, I hope this all gets heard. I wish Mediatonic the best of luck."

97365813,english,1,1097150,I have over 1300 hours on this game and it has given me the time of my life. I could never find a game that fitted me because ever other game in the world has complicated controls with 60 buttons. Fall Guys with 4 buttons is so incredibly simple and fun and made mine and so many others lives better in quarantine. Happy Birthday fall Guys!!
74006830,english,1,1097150,"There's no doubt Fall Guys deserves every ounce of the hype it's receiving - the game is ridiculously fun and an absolute blast to play alone or alongside a handful of friends, easily knocking Gang Beasts and similar titles off of their pedestals.  I trust Mediatonic will listen to the outcry for new levels, balancing, and content... but Fall Guys [b]will[/b] inevitably get repetitive and boring in the long run. For this reason, I encourage them to say attentive to community feedback and not fall into the void of trend-games; to do so, Fall Guys could follow in these three steps:   [b]Step One - Essentials[/b]  To begin, there's clearly a few minor issues with the game that most people are reporting across all platforms - notably regarding team games. Working together to complete objectives is fun, but individual skill currently holds no weight when qualifying for the next round.  Solving this is straightforward; team games should stay, but players may individually qualify throughout the round if they score enough points or hold the objective for enough seconds. Playing team games during a semi-final is very disappointing, since it's hard to shake the feeling that you may not qualify for the finals due to a rogue teammate.  Aside from team games, the majority of the minigames are hilarious, but I really hope that we don't have to wait for the end of the season for new maps. Seasons are around 60 days long which concerns me since there's a chance that we'll be in the same rotation of maps for another 2 months.   [b]Step Two - Update and Innovate[/b]  Undoubtedly, the most obvious way to maintain an active playerbase is to add new maps and skins, but this option can only be done so much before stagnating - I really want to see Fall Guys reaching the numbers it's doing right now around this time next year. To do this, Mediatonic need to be actively innovating and bringing in new features beyond the base game. Examples include:  [i]8-player Parties[/i]  Doubling the party size would be a great first non-map/non-cosmetic update - this currently being the main barrier holding back a few of my friends from buying, since our group cannot fit in a single party.  [i]New Moves[/i]  Controlling your Fall Guy is genius in its simplicity. Jumping, diving, and grabbing seem basic on the surface, but play a huge role in finding shortcuts, eliminating other players or getting a final boost of speed before reaching the finish line. However, as there are still many unused keys on both keyboard and controller, it'd be great to throw in an extra move or two.  One idea may be a high risk, yet high reward 'punt' button, allowing you to kick over a nearby opponent after a few seconds of charging up. However, missing a kick would cause your character to tumble forward, leaving them at risk to obstacles or other players.  [i]Weekly Event Days[/i]  Counter-Strike's War Games and Fortnite's LTM's opened up a new market for developers to satisfy niches in their audience, but tend to be stale and unexciting after a while.  Rather than sticking to the cookie-cut format of scattering limited-time modes throughout the year, Mediatonic could innovate by claiming a specific day of the week, introducing a unique spin on the entire game for 24 hours. '100-player Fridays' may be feasible; a once-a-week alternative to standard 60 player matches, containing exciting minigames tailored for larger groups alongside prodigious rewards for those who secure the crown. Providing the community with interesting spins on standard gameplay in small but addictive chunks may assist Fall Guys in moulding into [i]""that game we always play on Fridays""[/i], gradually shifting towards a lifestyle game that keeps people coming back to play week by week.  [i]Streamer Lobbies[/i]  Streamers will often return to games that enable them to play with their community, or host games such as 'Marbles On Stream' allowing active viewers to compete for personalised gifts such as a paid subscription, shout-out, or merchandise. With minimal crossover in this niche already, Fall Guys has an opportunity to grant streamers the ability to open a private lobby - rather than compete for crowns, viewers instead join through a room code and compete for a predetermined prize at the discretion of the streamer.   [b]Step Three - Sustaining Beyond 2020[/b]  With a mixture of luck and commitment, Fall Guys could become a smash hit, continuing to flourish over many years. Without getting too ahead of themselves, Mediatonic could consider opening their game up to the Steam workshop later down the line so players can upload their own maps and modes for approval. This way, Fall Guys is never short of quality content and unique ideas for the years to come!   To summarise, Fall Guys is awesome yet still has legroom to grow even bigger and better. In spite of expected day one issues, Fall Guys is far from being just another washed up gimmick, on the exception that Mediatonic really knuckle down on content and balancing [b]before[/b] the first season ends.  I strongly recommend Fall Guys and wish the very best for Mediatonic moving forward!"
77232547,english,0,1097150,"The updates are extremely slow and underwhelming, they hyped up season 2 so much and all they added was like a few new game modes and a couple changes to already existing maps.  Otherwise, the game is repetitive and gets boring really fast."

83890236,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a battle royale game where the player must guide their character through a series of events inspired by TV shows like Takeshi’s Castle or Ninja Warrior. Starting with 60 players in the match, roughly 10-15 players will be eliminated each round until the match ends with 1 winner.  There are lots of different events in the rotation so you won’t see the same ones in every match. Some events have players competing individually while others divide the players up into either 2 or 3 teams, with everybody on the losing team being eliminated.  Some events are races, where the player must jump over bottomless pits, avoid obstacles such as swinging axes, balls on chains and spinning blades, and cross the finish line as quickly as possible. In other events you have to score points by jumping through hoops, carrying eggs to a nest or pushing giant balls into goals. Or you might just need to stand on a platform while hazards try to knock you off. In some events, falling off the level will let you respawn at a checkpoint and try again, while in others, falling into slime results in instant elimination.  This is the first game I’ve played in the battle royale genre, and I’m enjoying the challenge of trying to get a win. I’d imagine most experienced gamers will find the first couple of rounds fairly easy to qualify from, but in the later rounds with only the best players remaining, it can be tough. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve finished in second or third place.  If you’ve watched your favourite streamer play Fall Guys (there was a time when pretty much everybody on Youtube was playing) and get annoyed by other players, I can confirm I know exactly how they feel. There’s nothing worse than somebody jumping into you just as you touch a bouncepad, causing you to fly off the level at a random angle, or when somebody grabs you for no reason (like, on a race event where they’ve got nothing to gain because it slows them down too), or when you dominate a team event but your team loses anyway. In most events though, its possible to recover from a couple of errors and still qualify, and being the last person to qualify for the next round feels great.  If you make it through to the final round, a complete match should take around 20 minutes to play. You’ll earn a couple of types of currency based on how far you survived, which lets you unlock some wacky cosmetic items. In 20 hours of gameplay I haven’t noticed any bugs. The physics sometimes feels a bit random but I think that is intentional because its a weird gameshow. Controls feel fine on my Xbox 360 controller. The art style is colourful and the music for most rounds is entertaining.  Fall Guys is a fun (and occasionally annoying) game to play if you’re looking for some wacky multiplayer action. Don’t let the art style fool you, it gets quite competitive in the later rounds. And there’s enough content and replayability to justify the price."
121547856,english,0,1097150,"I do not recommend this game after it was taken off the steam platform and put on Epic Games. It's turned into micro-transaction hell. It doesn't matter if you win anymore, so why keep playing?"
100479163,english,1,1097150,"[h1] Video Games [/h1]   While Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout isn't nearly as popular as it was around the time it launched, it still remains a perfect video game for what it sets out to accomplish. Its presentation, gameplay, low skill floor and price tag make it accessible to anyone who'd want to give it a try. If you're looking for something refreshing to play with a group of friends, even those who might not be big on video games, then look no further.   Gameplay-wise, it is the best Wipeout or Ninja Warrior game (n?)ever made. You know, those shows where people have to beat an obstacle course in order to win the prize money? Here it’s a bit different, with up to 60 players thrown into a match, consisting of several rounds. At the end of every round, those who fail to complete the objective in time are eliminated. Not every round is an obstacle course however, but can be anything from a vast plethora of minigames spread into six different categories.   For example, Race rounds will always task you with reaching the finish line of the course before a certain number of players manage to. Survival rounds will require you to not get eliminated before a certain number of players does, or a timer runs out. These are then further differentiated by themes and obstacles. One Survival round might have you balance atop of an ever-moving platform, dodging projectiles launched at you, while another will place you in an arena with three giant Rhinos attempting to knock you out. Team rounds, which require you to work with random players towards a common goal to prevent your entire team from being eliminated are all about scoring points, but can either be a game of basketball, football (the soccer kind) or collecting as high of a number of eggs as possible.   In the main game mode, a match must always start with a Race and end with a Finale – the most suspenseful, final round of the match, usually a Race that only one player can win or a Survival round that keeps going until the last man standing. Other game modes, both fixed and rotating, focus on specific categories or levels themselves. There are also custom matches you can make for you and your friends.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618963922  Even if all rounds across a category follow a certain pattern, none ultimately feel the same. Additional obstacles will sometimes appear on maps they were previously absent from, so the game can still throw you a curveball even when you think you have them all memorised.   Still, some are clearly better designed than others. Door Dash, a Race round, is a course consisting entirely out of doors. Some of these are openable, while the others aren’t – with there being no way of telling between the two until you try going through them. It almost completely eradicates the momentum of the match. If you go for an unlocked door consistently enough, you’ll qualify. If you don’t, tough luck. Other levels that solely consist of multitudes of the same obstacle have a similar effect, though none are as bad as Door Dash.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618967222  The controls are quite tight due to how limited they are. You can jump, grab (players, ledges, objects and some objectives) and dive, so the game requires a total of three buttons to play – excluding movement. A controller is ideal, but the keyboard and mouse perform almost just as well.  Progression feels good, but it could be better. Winning a round will net you a Crown, the game’s ’’premium’’ currency awarded solely through wins or milestones in the current Season’s battle pass-like progression, called Fame levels – limited to 50 per Season and increased by XP, which is awarded for each match you play. Each Crown you acquire also increases your overall player rank, which awards you cosmetics upon leveling up and is separate from your Fame level.   Besides Crowns, there are Kudos, a second currency awarded at certain Fame levels, as well as upon completion of a match regardless of whether you won or not. Kudos can also be purchased through microtransactions, in bundles as costly as $50, more than twice the game’s price. While the game isn’t by any means stingy with its rewards, the progression does feel a bit staggered and the inclusion of microtransactions can’t help but make me think of some marketing analyst or currency designer figuring out how to optimize it best to incentivise a purchase. Even when they aren’t intrusive, they’re there for a reason.  Your rewards can be spent in the store for cosmetic items. Some cost Kudos, some cost Crowns. There’s a fixed number of items that can be displayed in the store at a time and they reset once a day. Simple as. Customization options for your Fall Guy are quite varied and some visually striking combinations are possible, even without playing much.  Visually, the game is a colorful joy to look at, with the audio making it all the more appealing. The Fall Guys make cute ’’oofs“ and other sounds when they collide with each other, and scream of excitement when an obstacle launches them into the air – all of it heightened by a groovy, bass driven soundtrack. It just oozes fun.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618970077  Performance wise, the game ran great on max settings, at a steady 60 FPS. However, the animation LOD distance wasn’t that great, as players and obstacles further away would be running at a notably lower framerate. I don’t know if this is simply the way the game’s optimised, or something affected by the limitations of my specs. Weirdly enough, the game would sometimes drop down to 30 FPS while waiting in the lobby or the post-match recap.   Reviewed on the following system:  [table][tr][td]CPU [/td][td]AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6GHz[/td][/tr][tr][td]GPU[/td][td]GeForce GTX 1050Ti[/td][/tr][tr][td]RAM [/td][td]16GB[/td][/tr][/table]  While the game’s current player numbers are a far cry from what it once had, it still maintains a healthy population, both on Steam and outside of it, thanks to cross-play. I wholeheartedly hope that Mediatonic can keep Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout in such a state, as it’s a fun game that truly anyone can play. Even if you don’t end up winning, the little animation your Fall Guy does during the post-match summary shows that he’s had a lot of fun even participating, just as you will. Here’s to hoping it can keep going strong in the years to come, at least as long until there’s a worthy successor.

74905856,english,1,1097150,"[h1][b]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout - a virtual mirror for human behaviour![/b][/h1]  [h1]Let the games begin[/h1]  Imagine 60 brightly colored jelly beans dressed up in grotesquely jumbled up costumes and with the same goal - a golden crown. The winner is determined by 3 types of mini-games: race, survival and team. Each next task depends on how many players are still competing. You can run, jump, do a racing dive and grab - that´s it. As in real life everyone lives out their character. You will be pushed into the abyss, jostled, attacked by teams and finally mocked before the finish line. Please also welcome the fraudulent plague of the digital age that is literally flying over the cuckoo's nest. And ultimately the game physics, based on loss of movement control, ensures mass collisions and gives you the rest.  In a nutshell: 60 beans line up, one wins.  [h1]+/-[/h1]  + Takeshi´s Castle style + play with up to 3 friends + quick matchmaking + fast games - max 15-20 minutes to the crown I didn´t get once + rumbling jelly beans + hilarious fun and absurd situations + free season pass + customization - costumes, emotes, victory poses etc. + more hilarious fun and even more absurd situations + watch remaining players after reaching the finish line or even when you´re out  +/- easy to learn but(t) hard to master - did I mention I never got a single crown?!! +/- monetization for cosmetics and the game currency Kudos +/- your starting position can make the small but subtle difference, rotation makes it fair +/- after 1-2 hours you know all mini-games, but more are announced  - There´s nothing really negative to say about Fall Guys. Yes, there are cheaters, but show me a multiplayer game where these dishonorable beings don´t show up. And yes, the unexpected success of Fall Guys initially completely overwhelmed the servers and you still may experience a disconnect or lag here and there. So what, go for the next round. Unfortunately there is a trend for negativity in reviews and forums these days because people have neither understanding nor patience anymore. And in the end all depends on how developers communicate with their player base and solve problems. They did a great job so far and seem to really care about their game.  [h1]Is Fall Guys worth your time and money?[/h1]  Absolutely! It´s screamingly funny and the first so-called Battle Royale that I enjoy. No ranking lists, no weapons to master and in lack of a chat no russian pet names for your mother. Fall Guys definitely is the multiplayer feast of this summer that nobody expected. So join the party or be a party pooper."
91703128,english,1,1097150,"As a child I always wanted to participate in the Japanese show Takeshi Castle. I certainly wasn't expecting to relive that fantasy while playing as a jelly bean but alas here I am.  The premise is simple, race and fight your way to victory in order to retrieve the crown. It's rather addictive game which can leave you feeling like a ruling tyrant or going through all the stages of grief."
73892538,english,1,1097150,Its all fun and games until... oh wait it is all fun and games. hmm i guess this is what every game is missing these days.
164994638,english,0,1097150,"Newest update ruined the game. [list] [*]They forced creative content into the main shows. Most of them don't have clear descriptions or instructions on their loading screens. Is this a race? survival? You don't know until you figure it out live in the game. [*]The quality of these maps vary widely. [*]Many of them don't follow design principles and can't be sight read. Falling feels more like a ""gotcha!"" moment than actual failure. [*]The starting groups are now smaller so winning doesn't have as much impact. [/list]  The only good thing I saw was that there is a faster transition between games.  They need to bring back the old choices and let players choose to play creative maps or standard. What would really make this game shine again is bringing back all the old maps they've removed over the years in an ""everything goes"" mode."
74044622,english,1,1097150,"I guess I get to write a review for this right away because my ""review after finishing a game"" policy doesn't apply here as Fall Guys is a game that never ends and I hope just keeps going on forever.  It's a cute battle royale which I haven't had the pleasure of playing since Mario Party or something like that.  Every woman, man and his dog already knows about Fall Guys so let's just get down to brass tacks.  __________________  [h1] PROS [/h1]  +  Fun with a capital F.  Everything is colourful and playful and when I played each time the servers were pretty fast.    +  room for improvement.  We are in season 1 now and I hope that next seasons come with new maps.  There is a huge window of opportunity to keep the game fresh and therefore the play-count high.  The devs are going to have to really focus on this aspect because at 60 players per room, that's a helluva goal to set to keep this game alive.  But to be fair when you have a bunch of seasons of Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle to draw from for inspiration then we are all set for a few years I think.  +  maps.  There are a lot of maps but I haven't experienced them all yet in my 4 hours.  Some are better than others but everyone will have their own preferences.  Some maps are hectic scrums, others require a bit more platforming savvy techniques, others yet have a more physical dexterity aspect.  There is something for everyone.  +  microtransactions are purely cosmetic and offer no bonuses to the players.  There are a bunch of skins you can buy or grind out using the in-game currency, Kudos.  But there is nothing I can see that offers a speed or jumping bonus, etc.  Just MTX to keep funding the game once saturation of the player base has been reached, I suppose.  -------------------------  [h1] CONS [/h1]  -  names.  EVERYONE has a username of fallguy XXXX where X=numbers.  I want to put my own name in there.  I want to see my friends I am playing with.  I want to know that b'stard that pushed me off a ledge.    -  controls.  The controls seem a bit too sluggish for me.  Changing direction or trying to grab something can feel like you are doing it through a pool of syrup.  -  hackers ruin everything.  I have only seen a couple but they are out there and they are x10 faster than us, they begin before the starting gun fires, they jump higher and further than us and it is zero fun watching them take the crown.  -------------------------  Fall Guys is a blast.  Trust me and the millions of other jellybeans that are going bananas over this title."
118666489,english,0,1097150,"I remember when I bought this game in 2021. A key part of that memory involves the fact that, at that time, I was actually able to, you know, play the game. (For a few hours. I think I snagged it during a sale, tried it out for a bit, and then planned on playing it more substantially later.)  Now. in 2022, I attempt to start the game up. I discover that there are now about 10 layers of Epic Games garbage retrofitted to the game; and so in addition to taking forever to launch, it never gets past the very first ""Loading"" screen. I literally can't even make it to the main menu. I've done all the usual troubleshooting steps, and nothing works. [b]It's just completely effing broken.[/b]  Add to that the various other controversial changes apparently done to the game in the time since the developers/publishers sold their souls to Epic Games (these changes are well-documented by others), and the only message I can reasonably say I'm getting from the people behind this game is a giant middle finger.  I'm currently attempting to get a refund, since I bought the game under a particular understanding, and the game has been completely changed in such a way that it no longer reflects the buying decision I originally made at all. (For example: when I bought it, I did so on the understanding that I would be able to, like, you know, [b]play the game[/b], or at least even get to the main menu. And while this was possible at the time I paid for the game, it's no longer possible. Not being able to play the game is one fairly significant factor that would generally tend to make me not want to spend money on a game and buy it.)  [b]If the developers/publishers are going to take away my ability to play the game I paid for, then I think it's only fair that I be allowed to take away the money that I gave them, in good faith, on the understanding that I'd be able to effing play the damn thing in the first place.[/b]  [b]UPDATE:[/b]  For anyone who runs into the same problem I did: After an inane amount of time wasted troubleshooting this stupid problem, I have concluded that the infinite loading screen is, in fact, actually just Epic Games's intuitive way of informing you that you need to link your Epic Games account to your Steam account in order for the game to load. Their game overlay system is apparently broken or fucked or whatever, and so it just doesn't bother to show up and inform you of what the hell you need to actually do. This is genius-level game design. Also, if you weren't able to figure out that ""infinite loading screen means I need to link my accounts"", then you are probably an idiot who will be yelled at by other, definitely much smarter, people for not being able to figure out such an obvious thing yourself.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840429916"
79725349,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout is one of the most popular of this year, so let's take a look at this Takeshi Castle inspired game. Since there's no story, let's jump into graphics.   Graphics:  Fall Guys has an absolutely amazing art style. The world is bright and colorful and the bean people you control are absolutely adorable. You can also buy different costumes and outfit your bean with the style that suits you the best. There will be that one costume that you will definitely want to save up for and bring into every game you go into.   The bright and colorful look of the world is an absolute joy. Everything is splattered with bright colors like pink, blue, yellow and others, it honestly reminded me of cartoons I would watch as a kid. The game is really pleasant to the eye and for that I got to give major props to the designers.   Audio:  The music of Fall Guys has no reason to be as good as it is. Most of the tracks are insanely catchy, especially the final round music which is by far the best track in the game. Most of the other ones are also really good and honestly I loved most of the tracks in the game.  One other thing is the sound effects. First of all, I got to admit that the sounds the beans make when expressing joy, sadness and when something happens when they bump into something or fall are incredibly adorable. That's the one thing that I never get sick of when playing the game.  Also the beans themselves look mushy and the sounds they make when bumping into things is oddly satisfying. Overall I think the audio design and it's a definite highlight of the game, especially the incredibly catchy soundtrack.  Gameplay:  Ever watched Takeshi's Castle ? Wipeout ? Well imagine if Fall Guys is the video game adaption of those two shows. The game is basically a battle royale where you go through obstacle courses until you're the last man standing. So let's talk about the meat and potatoes of the game, which is the courses.  There's a good variety of courses in the game, ranging from races, team games and survival games. Race courses are courses where you race to the finish line, while avoiding obstacles. Team games are usually objective games where you team up with other players to compete against other teams and lastly survival games where you avoid stuff trying to survive until enough players are eliminated.   The good majority of the courses are really well designed and fun to play, they rely on your skill and when you have one very clean run avoiding everything and coming out at the front is so satisfying, however a good majority of the courses are incredibly poorly designed.   First of all there's a few courses in the game where a few players have to sacrifice themselves so other players can win. This is mostly a problem in Tip Toe and Wall Guys, where a couple of players have to set up a path for the other players to follow, which will definitely mean they will lose.  Not to mention See Saw, where players will refuse to stand on one side because that will put them behind other players.  But those usually have nothing on the team games. Pretty much all of these are incredibly poorly designed. These game modes never rely on your skill, but the skill of the players that are assigned to your team. You might get unlucky and get players that leave that one course they simply hate and would rather just get into another game, or as soon as you're one point behind, they will start trolling. Most of these are incredibly tedious and when I get a team game,  I find the experience more tedious than fun.   Once enough players are eliminated you go into the finale. There's currently four different finales and honestly these are a mixed bag. The most poorly designed is Fall Mountain. This is a course where you race to the top of a mountain to grab a crown and this is a course that is purely dependent on the RNG of the game. If there's enough players for three rows, if you're in row three, you can basically give up before the game even begins.   Another one that I find incredibly stupid is Jump Showdown. In this one you're on platforms avoiding a pillar that keeps spinning, trying to knock you off, until there's only one man left standing. In this one the platforms keep falling off and there is a high possibility you can get stuck on a side that will lose all platforms with no way to recover. But if you do find yourself on the last few platforms left standing, then it's purely skill that can get you the win.   Also each course has different variations with different obstacles   Even with these negatives, I found the game a ton of fun and most of the courses incredibly fun, hopefully the bad ones get taken out of the game and reworked or the just vaulted entirely and I really want more skill based finales.   Verdict:  Fall Guys is a ton of fun and honestly even with it's issues I had an absolute blast going through the crazy courses, racing other players and getting that sweet sweet crown. Overall for the price you get a really solid multiplayer experience, which could last you countless hours. If you're looking for something bright to cheer you up in dark times, Fall Guys is definitely the game to go with.   Final Rating: 9/10  Pros: + Most courses are incredibly fun to go through + Bright and cute art style is pleasing to the eye + Amazing score   Cons: - Tons of courses depend on luck, rather than skill - Team games  If you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews"
115571697,english,1,1097150,It is going f2p next month.  I bought this last month played first hour it was fun but got bored quickly and refunded.  Now it is going f2p.
73803912,english,0,1097150,"I'll start off with saying this is FAR from a bad game, and definitely has potential to be a great and fun experience, but right now it just has some glaring issues that really put me off from playing more than just a few games, I heavily encourage you to look up more reviews and gameplay to decide if it's something for you but here's what nags me personally;  [h1]Repetitiveness[/h1] Right now it's difficult for me to really keep going as you keep seeing the same maps over and over in just a few hours of playtime, and most of these involve running forward from one end to the other before X amount of players do, with the inspiration this game draws from Takeshi's Castle this is understandable, but I feel like more could be done in this regard to make the average game more varied.  [h1]Team games feel awful[/h1] Generally I enjoy the game in short bursts, but I have absolutely never enjoyed any of the team games, it honestly just feels like a 2 minute wait to roll your 66% or 50% chance to not be eliminated, this isn't helped by the fact teams can be uneven in terms of player numbers and objectives spawning at random in some of these minigames, I really wish there was an option to opt out of these.  [h1]Winning as a currency[/h1] This is entirely subjective, but I hate this, of course there's skill involved but winning is mostly a random ordeal from my experience, yet there's time-limited cosmetics you can only obtain by winning 10 or so games, quickly shifting the focus from lighthearted fun to just getting annoyed if you don't get the crown should you be interested in any of those cosmetics. I really wish there was no arbitrary time limit on these things or another way to get the currency so you can steadily progress, the pressure to win is something I don't enjoy in a casual party game, of course reward the winner but please don't lock things solely behind winning games.  [h1]Final rounds are very discouraging.[/h1] Currently there are 3 minigames for the final round to decide the winner, two of these feel utterly pointless to me as one of them is a race, but you spawn in 2 rows, if you don't spawn in the first row you've generally lost from the second it starts. The other game involves holding an item when a timer runs out, which generally just results in running in a circle for 2 minutes, only to end up in a clump of people for the last few seconds, mashing the grab button and praying you have the thing when the clock runs out, which is more frustrating than anything. The third game is one I actually enjoy where you need to move across disappearing platforms in multiple layers to avoid falling down, the last one standing wins, this doesn't feel as random or reliant on luck and makes for a much more fun experience, I hope more final minigames follow this trend.   All that said, I'm still excited to see where this game goes, as new maps and minigames are already planned, and I'm already very close to recommending the game."
73975501,english,1,1097150,"There is just something about running head first into doors as a cute bean in a raptor outfit, 60 people bumping into each other, sounds of hitting squeaky toys all around, that is very repetitive, but makes you want to keep coming back everytime."
127871314,english,0,1097150,"Played over 300 hours and it used to be a lot of fun. The devs have always taken questionable paths regarding level rotation and game updates in general, but since the Epic takeover this game has dropped into the bin.   Same maps day in day out, bearing in mind there are around 100 potential levels to choose from, yet hardly ever get to play them (some of which seem to have been permanently discarded).  Mundane season changes which again force monotonous rotation ad nauseum.  Terrible take over by EpicGames which means frequently you can't even play the game when the servers are down, and also a freemium content model which removes the ability to earn anything worthwhile in the game such as  new costumes, as these have become accessible only for real money. You can still use the in-game currency to buy backpacks and shoes though, so there you go. woo.  Disgrace."
84528738,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Fall Guys[/h1] With a massive cheating problem the first half of the 1st season it was pretty much unwinnable. After upgrading their anti-cheat it became much more enjoyable as you could win a few games. Sadly with that rough start and to slow content additions (if any at first), a lot of players left the game. It is the main problem with a game like Fall Guys, it gets old playing the same maps constantly. Season 2 had mediocre content, but Season 3 is by far the best season so far seen to content.  Fall Guys also suffers a lot from haters and labeling. The game is not Dead by any means and it people still spam and try to massively downplay the game, a lto havent even tried it... As goes with the labeling it isnt a casual game at all. Play with your little children and they will most likely fail to qualify from the first round and a lot of players statistically havent even won a full episode once. While skill is needed, it is very RNG dependant. To make it even worse there is a clear adv/disadvantage between players. Players are not affected by collision, grabbing and phisics equally. This explains why so few have less than 20 wins. The game greatly rewards skilled players, especially those with advantage. Notice that golden person that is ungrabbable, that can walk into you moving you a long while if you do it you wont move them an inch. Do you fall more often and take much longer to get up? Just watch a top player stream and compare your game, I can say mine isnt the same as theirs...  So to summerize some things the game has a good community, lots of haters and heavily rewards the top 1% of the game, it is probably fun for most people for a while, but many wont last even 5-10 hours. Since they have episode varriations now I mostly play when good structured ones appear like the recent Hex-a-gone only one so I dont get bored.  Ignoring bad phisics, adv/dis etc. the game suffers from some other problems aswell. For instance some people have a lot of disconnects and team games suffer from balancing when te teams are uneven. If your side is losing you dont get punished at all from leaving early and solidifying a loss for the team, 3 team games many teams end by simply having 2 teams gang up against one team which the game has no mechanics to balance against. Lastly, for some reason they have an achievement for winning 5 episodes in a row. Devs WTF, are you serious? Disconnects break the streak aswell and early people used exploit to get it by leaving if they werent sure they would win to keep the streak...  In conclusion the game is fun, for a while but grows old rather quicky. It doesnt take that long to finish the season pass and has been easier with each season. Better players with not too much disadv get waaay more rewarded than other player with much higher playtimes and can usuallly buy everything constantly in the shop (cosmetics).  I recommend Fall Guys since it provides a good amount of fun and suits a lot of different people. I hope they further balance the game between bad and good players, it doesnt really make much sense pitting the best against the worst in a battle royal and denying many players the ability to get a single win. The biggest issue of being vastly unfair between players hopefully will get smaller as they keep optimizing and polishing the game.  //ECE//"

Epic Games recently bought Fall Guys and that's a good move for reviving this game again. I think with this will come new content more often.

For some reason this game reminds me of that old japanese TV show 'Takeshi's castle' where also, 50 or more competitors, have to go through a series of obstacle parcours and who makes it to the finale can play the finale.  Only difference was that all competitors didn't had to go through the obstacle parcours all at once, and this is what this game makes so much fun,  Imagine 60 players all together trying to be the first to squeese through a moving door, or how you will always fail to balance a platform to move to the next.

Each level has a simple goal, whether it being to jump over obstacles or bash through the right door and reach the finish line. The overall objective is to qualify each round until you reach the final round for the ultimate victory. Given time, anyone can pick this up and eventually win a game.     + The game has a colourful art style that is very effective at luring people in and hiding how frustrating the game can be. The visual design of the levels, although simple, is nice to look at, and the character designs are iconic.   + The game is challenging. Fall Guys will inevitably get you angry at some point, whether it’ll be because of the wacky physics or somebody getting in the way. It’s both the silliness and the competitiveness that make this game really fun to play.  + As well as being challenging, it’s also addicting. Sure, it doesn’t take long to end up playing the same games again and again but that didn’t bother me much because each round felt different. It’s all dependant on who you’re put up against.   + There is a vast amount of customisation items for your character, ranging from colours, patterns and outfits. The devs regularly introduce cross over events with other games. At the time of writing, they have done TF2, Portal 2 and Enter the Gungeon. There is also a free battle pass that gives you cosmetics as you progress.          [h1]What I don’t like:[/h1]  - Team games are definitely hit or miss. Sometimes they’re great. Sometimes they’re awful. The problem is that people leave as soon as their team is losing, screwing over the people who are trying. I don’t mind team games, but it would be nice if there could be two types of match searches; one type being solo games only, and the other being a mix of the two.  - I can’t say I like the tail games. The hitboxes for them seem really inconsistent. There were times where I should’ve grabbed the tail but the game failed to detect it. That or I’m just really bad. It could be that.  - Although not as bad as they used to be, server issues are still prevalent. Disconnects and lag spikes will happen every so often. Speed hackers and cheaters are also a problem. Yes people hack in this game, it's incredible really.   [h1]My Overall Thoughts:[/h1]  Fall Guys has become insanely popular since release and I can understand why. It’s a unique take on a battle royale that manages to make the genre enjoyable to people who despise it. The fact that it still has a massive playerbase shows that the devs did many things right.  As I mentioned before, it’s the silliness and competitiveness in each round that make this game enjoyable and memorable. It’s meant to be frustrating. It’s meant to be over the top. And it’s really damn fun. The game has a charm that I personally haven’t seen much of in multiplayer games.  That being said, the game is far from perfect. Fall Guys had a rough launch server wise and still has a way to go. It also has a hacker problem which is in the process of being fixed. The game still needs some new features such as advanced searches as well as tweaks to already existing game modes.   Fall Guys isn’t necessarily a game you will play for a prolonged period of time, but it’s a brilliant pick if you want something to spend the time. It’s great on your own and it’s great with friends, and with its current price tag, I’d say it’s worth it.

96308081,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is one of the most enjoyable online gaming experiences. With simple controls, heaps of fun, replayable mini-games and customizations (paid or won) that do not alter the gameplay, and a catchy background tune, Fall Guys has everything that causes addictive play. Indeed, even when you are eliminated, there is the immediate urge to hop back in and try your luck again. The only thing that lets Fall Guys down is the inability to play local matches against friends on your couch. The vibrant levels, with their inflatable-like obstacles and moving platforms wouldn’t be out of place on a TV game show. Indeed, I’m now looking forward to the Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout TV adaption, where players must don Fall Guy suits and compete in a similar series of wacky and enjoyable events. Until then, Fall Guys will be my multiplayer game of choice."
92550457,english,1,1097150,"If you asked me if I'd recommend this game when it first came out, I'd say no. Back then, it was pretty much the same 10 minigames over and over, which got boring REALLY fast.   But now, as of the time I'm writing this (season 4.5) there are 46 different minigames, and that number doesn't include the fact that many minigames have random variations that might change up the game significantly, so really the amount of UNIQUE minigames is probably up in the hundreds. Now I can play for an hour and barely see any repeat minigames, which was basically impossible when this game first launched.   TL:DR The game used to be boring, but now it isn't since the devs added (and are continuing to add) a bunch of new minigames which helps keep it fresh.  Plus the music has no right being that good"
79841325,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” burst onto the gaming scene with a splash in August 2020, capturing the hearts of players with its unique blend of chaotic fun and colorful, whimsical aesthetics. Developed by Mediatonic, this battle royale-style party game quickly became a cultural phenomenon, celebrated for its vibrant graphics, quirky challenges, and family-friendly appeal. Unfortunately, despite its initial success, “Fall Guys” is no longer available on Steam, leaving many fans longing for its return on the platform.[/b]  [h1]Gameplay and Appeal[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” offers a delightful twist on the battle royale genre, replacing the intense combat with a series of absurdly fun mini-games and obstacle courses. Players control customizable jellybean-like characters as they navigate through increasingly difficult rounds, all while avoiding elimination. The game's charm lies in its accessibility; anyone can pick up and play, making it a great choice for both casual gamers and those seeking a lighthearted competitive experience.  The vibrant, cartoonish art style and upbeat soundtrack create an inviting atmosphere, enhancing the enjoyment of its frenetic gameplay. Each round is a chaotic spectacle, where strategy and timing blend with a healthy dose of luck. Whether you're dodging swinging hammers or leaping across precarious platforms, the sheer unpredictability of each match ensures that no two games are ever the same.[/b]  [h1]The Hype[/h1]  [b]At launch, “Fall Guys” was met with widespread enthusiasm and quickly garnered a dedicated player base. Its appeal was amplified by its engaging, easy-to-learn gameplay and the ability to play with friends, which made it a popular choice for streamers and content creators. The game's success was further fueled by regular updates, seasonal events, and collaborations with various franchises, which kept the content fresh and exciting.[/b]  [h1]The Downfall[/h1]  [b]Despite its early success, “Fall Guys” faced significant challenges over time. One of the major issues was the server instability and connectivity problems that plagued players, particularly during peak times or after major updates. These technical difficulties detracted from the overall experience and led to frustration among the player base.  More critically, the decision to remove “Fall Guys” from Steam was a disappointing turn for many. The game transitioned to a free-to-play model and launched on other platforms, including Epic Games Store, which led to its withdrawal from Steam. This shift was met with mixed reactions, as it left a portion of the community unable to access the game through their preferred platform.  The transition also meant that future updates and new content were no longer available to Steam users, diminishing the game's visibility and impact on the platform. While the game’s cross-platform functionality ensured that players on other platforms could still enjoy it, the Steam community was left feeling somewhat abandoned.[/b]  [h1]Conclusion[/h1]  [b]“Fall Guys” remains a memorable entry in the gaming landscape, celebrated for its whimsical charm and engaging gameplay. While the decision to remove the game from Steam was a blow to many fans, the game's legacy endures through its continued presence on other platforms and the fond memories it created during its peak.[/b]  [i]The game’s hype was well-deserved, as it brought a fresh and entertaining twist to the battle royale genre. However, the challenges it faced, particularly the platform transition and technical issues, highlight the difficulties of maintaining momentum in a highly competitive market. For those who experienced its glory days on Steam, “Fall Guys” will always be a beloved reminder of the fun and chaos of its unique gameplay.[/i]"
79018450,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys is really fun! I've just picked up the game a few months after release, and while there was a stumbling block in doing well due to the skill of other players (and the fact that I suck at video games in general), I've managed to make it pretty far and have a lot of fun. Don't believe anyone who says this game is dying! It may not be meme-level status anymore but it's still very fun and has lots of players."
77164093,english,1,1097150,"enjoying it quite much. i didnt see any cheaters in my game in my whole session so the anti-cheat is working well. don't like how some rounds have RNG elements but 'tis but a fun little game.  edit: I was waiting for season 2 to appear before I can write this but I have a major issue with server outages. I keep getting disconnected from servers and I face with heavy desyncs. Also, server availability for asia in general is really bad. at around 1:30am my time, the matchmaking goes into forever loop and I can't find anyone. So make your decision according to this.  good game but servers are not good.  edit 2: still same the same issue (27/11/20)"
74796725,english,1,1097150,"[h1]Not worth the Price[/h1]  + Very cute visually with vibrant colors + The events are mostly well designed and fun + Addictive replayability trying to someday be #1 + Great fun to see 60 players competing at the start of each game   - Not enough events. Even as a new player, after a few games you will be repeating events, after about 10 games you will have experienced everything this game has to offer. - Starts to feel a bit repetitive after about 1 hour (in my experience) - In-game cash shop   Overall, is it fun? Yes, for a limited short time.  With the current amount of content available within Fall Guys, I would have priced this game at around $5.  If they decide to add (A LOT) more content later on, than perhaps this game is justifiable at $20, but currently I wouldn't imagine playing Fall Guys for more than about 2 hours.   *Voted Positive, because the game is truly fun, and I don't want to bash it just for the price*"
94862122,english,0,1097150,"This is a hard review to make as I have a mixed feeling about the game overall. I've stuck with it ever since Season 1 and never really stopped playing it except for Season 3. You could say I just really, really want the game of this type to succeed.  What pulls me in is the unique [strike]tournament style[/strike] battle royale gameplay you have. It's just a bunch of minigames (47 as of writing of this) that you face randomly. The pull of this game for me is that you can play solo, that it's a platformer-ish BR and that it creates unique combos of levels every match. The first few rounds are often easy, not punishing and include quite a bit of random. For example - Door Dash is pretty much RNG - you slam against doors and hope they're not fake. Pretty RNG if you ask me, but it only spawns with at least 40 players, which you are very likely not to be at after round 2. On the other hard, the finals are supposed to be hard, skill-testing experiences, because only one winner emerges and that winner wins the whole show.  The problems arise when you actually take more than 2 seconds to look at the game. Back when this game first released, PC had a massive cheater problem which persisted for ~40 days until they finally released a mid-season patch. At that point most mainstream players weren't even playing anymore. This is an example of how horrible Mediatonic (the devs) are at game polish. This game has had constant polish issues. Season 4's release was a bugfest - they introduced the new Squads Show (which I liked), but it was very buggy - almost as if the devs never even tested it, or tested it with such strange priorities, that they only ever cared about fixing the game-breaking bugs. Speaking of priorities, I find Mediatonic a strange outlier in this category as well - most developers, for example, Mojang with Minecraft, push out multiple bug fix updates after their newest release to make sure that players have the least buggy experience before starting work on new features. That's not how it works for Mediatonic! Every season, they appear to have this cycle: * Season drops - new features, meaning new bugs * One hotfix a few days later or a week later (at least the one that the community gets notified about) * A lot of time passes * Mid-season patch - fixes bugs AND adds new features (new bugs) * More time passes * Repeat I assume Mediatonic is on a time crunch or something, because they are trying to dish out new features as quickly as possible...  Asides from polish, the design of the game is questionable as well. The most distinct and unique features of Fall Guys is what you play as - you play as beans which are designed with kinda strange physics. They can fall over, get hit, stretch (visually) and flip over... but they can also get flung or... just act strange and unpredictable. Fall Guys doesn't offer solid server sync. I've never seen myself get teleported or re-synced with the server somehow - the server doesn't control any of that. What this means is Fall Guys has one of the worst desync I've seen of all games. You can be sure that most of the players you see on your screen are actually at least a bit ahead. Near the end of races, I often see players disappear off the map BEFORE they cross the line. The problem with this is when you play tail tag games and Jinxed, where the game OBJECTIVE, depends on something that's desynced... Luckily it's usually not THAT bad. I pretty much never had strong issues with Tail Tag, Royal Fumble and games like that. What's more annoying is the more prevalent mechanic - GRABBING. Grabbing is the strongest mechanic when it comes to interacting with players. What's annoying about it, is that you can get grabbed by a desynced player who looks like he's really behind you (on whose screen you're closer to them). When that happens, you will literally get flung backwards against your win and then stuck for a bit... It's also annoying because the duration for which you get stuck appears to be random. Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's long. Also, if you are the one to grab a player, you also kind of get stuck. It's annoying because when you stop holding the key to grab, there's a noticeable delay to get unstuck from the grabbing position. This is a flimsy mechanic that is now integral to the game, giving the game it's own 'feel', which really sucks, because it's often frustrating to many players and is the main way to grief other players. I get that there needs to be a way to interact with others, but I really wish it was less annoying than that. There are even more issues with desync, but I don't think Steam can handle my review to be much longer....  I know I've said that Fall Guys seems to pertain a pattern where the first rounds are easy and kinda random, while last rounds require skill, but really isn't the reality - it's just a pattern people WANT to see. There are currently 6 finals in the game. The final that requires the most skill is Jump Showdown, but on paper it sounds really boring - it's just a final version of Jump Club with a top and bottom 2-sided baton, where the bottom baton speeds up over 5 minutes that the round lasts. The only other thing about the final that is unique, is that its floor divided into 8 parts is slowly destroyed down to 2, limiting your running space (and introducing unfair RNG that is STILL not fixed!). That sounds boring... but unfortunately simple rounds are like that are somewhat common in Fall Guys (which in my opinion isn't an issue that much). What's the issue are the other finals. I don't have strong issues with Royal Fumble, though people considered it the worst final. My issue is with finals like Fall Mountain or as I like to call it ""RNG Mountain"". The game is a climb upwards with very unpredictable elements determined by RNG. Due to lack of autonomy over your characters, it's often impossible to dodge or gain a benefit from oncoming projectiles. In my opinion this was the worst final until Season 4.5, where they managed to outdo themselves somehow. Mediatonic, on a quest to add more variations, decided to add low gravity to (the overrated) Hex-A-Gone and Thin Ice... this turned them into the most boring finals ever. Because everyone has very large jumping range and all of it is very slow, it becomes child's play until the final moment of the final. At that final moment, the only thing that impacts the result is who jumps LAST and spends the most time midair. That's the winner! That's it! Who thought this was a good idea? I understand the will to add more variations, but there are so many better ways to do it! How about you change the positions of hexes? How about you make interesting layers out of them??? Or what about making special new types of hexes that do something? There are so many things you could do but you didn't bother... What's also upsetting is the choice of what Mediatonic chooses to even add in each season. Consider the fact that every single season since release had ALWAYS added new Team games... you know, the game archetype that MOST players hate??? From noobs to pros, most HATE Team games. They are only good in Squads Shows imo. Team is arguably one of the biggest archetypes in the game with most rounds, while also being the most hated type of game. Season 3 is the only season to have added new Finals. What's upsetting is that these 'new' Finals are just Final reskins of already existing games! They added Roll Off, which is the final version of Roll Out and they added Thin Ice, a more boring variation of Hex-A-Gone... That's how creative they are despite the constant streams of suggestions they opened up for themselves, they couldn't come up with anything more original.  I'll end this review here for now. There are more issues with the game, like the controversies Mediatonic had with exclusive skins, worrying monetization and Mediatonic's belligerence with trackers. I still like the game and really wish it improved... 6/10"
122194397,english,1,1097150,you cant buy it anymore anyways so whats the point of this review when noone will see it?
80550533,english,1,1097150,"Look here me out, This game is a masterpiece as it allows for casual players to have fun, but also rewards more competitive gamers with the allure of a battle royale. It can seem repetitive to some people but the silliness of it all keeps you hooked. Some people may get frustrated by the randomness of certain rounds (team battles) but it is easy to jump back in and try again. The microtransactions aren't intrusive and are very rewarding for low prices, so people who are willing to spend can get the best value out of it. The battle pass is even free! And the soundtrack just fills you with an adrenaline rush. Overall, this game is for those who value fun over competition and winning and it really pays off to just enjoy it. Have fun falling!"
81541983,english,1,1097150,"Especially good and fun with friends, but... 6 months after release and still disconnects in every ""show""? Thats a fucking joke?"
75610402,english,0,1097150,"This game is more fun to watch than play. It's hilarious at times but becomes repetitive too quickly, no point of playing with your friends either. I had 2 cheaters in my first game that just flew to the finish line. I'm refunding this but willing to give it an another chance if they improve co-op and implement a proper anti-cheat system."
81782830,english,1,1097150,"You might not like it, but this is what peak Battle Royale looks like.  The level design is based on the idea that each level is 50% skill and 50% random. So, there will be chaos, and frustration, but also this will create some hilarious moments. More than once I have found myself actually laughing out loud.  I think the graphics are neat, and you can have some funny costumes for your bean; all the while listening to a soundtrack that just fits.  The only real problem with the game is its netcode, this creates a lot of situations that feel, and are, unfair.   Rating: Fail guys.  *Editors' Pick* https://pixelloot.com"
154350608,english,0,1097150,Epic ruins games  Bought this game for $20 before epic had anything to do with it and my progress was taken because I changed my linked epic account
87075938,english,0,1097150,"This is a good game to play with a group of 3 other friends, and it's can be a good game for children.  Other than that, this game was Game of The Month in August of 2020.  Sadly, Fall Guys gets very repetitive, as the algorithm that decides which level you play will often give you the same levels over and over again. Not to mention if you are playing the game by yourself, it can be very frustrating as every player(as well as the level) is working against you, and no one is working with you.  There was a time during season 1 when Fall Guys actually favored those who were skilled at the game. Sadly they eventually started changing it so that there were so many obstacles that skill no longer will help you much with winning as it once did. And even when there weren't so many obstacles to get in your way, there used to be hackers in season one to keep you from winning. Apparently Mediatonic thought it was fine to replace hackers with moving obstacles to keep this game from being at all skill based when it comes to winning. This is one of the few games that I know of where you can get good at the game and never win a crown by actually winning. I know so many people who have played this game, only to get second place, and never first.  Honestly, the most disappointing part of Fall Guys isn't even anything I just listed. The most disappointing part of it, that I find, is that at most, there are only 2 game modes at any given time. I remember how when everyone I knew was playing this game would talk about how awesome it would be if at least streamers could organize their own games with 60 or less players from their chats. Sadly, this game doesn't get much added to it, other than skins. Yeah, there are just a few new levels every season, but not much changes about this game, as it is largely luck based and is a waste of time for players like myself.  All in all, this game was over-hyped and likely will not stand the test of time. I don't recommend it to anyone looking for a good game, unless they like repetitiveness."
107946780,english,0,1097150,"If you want to get into this game, I recommend looking into some of these features within the game before making your judgement. This post will be a cumulative list of the worst of Fall Guys, and will go on for a while, so be warned.  Going into this list, I want you to keep two key facts in mind. Number one, take into consideration this quote, in its absolution, no edits, no paraphrasing, from the March 2nd, 2021 official Mediatonic release about their acquisition by Epic Games:  [quote=Mediatonic]""Joining forces with Epic will accelerate our plans to improve the game and bring Fall Guys to as many players as possible, while continuing to support the community.""[/quote]  Second, consider the fact that most, if not all, of the clips I will be sharing were delivered [b]on level release[/b]. Some of these features date back to the game's early months. I want you to consider this: an error in the game that lasts a couple of weeks is a bug, a hitch in the experience. If that issue persists into month durations, that's no longer a bug. That's the experience the developers want you to be having while playing this game.  These are the types of experiences that the developers have left unchecked for several months, and thus, want you to be experiencing by buying this game.

Surely if these were to be considered bugs and glitches, then Mediatonic would absolutely take time to remedy these issues, and if these were issues to begin with, then keeping them within the game for several months and counting means that the community is [i]wrong[/i], and these are indeed the improvements promised to us with the newly acquired resources necessary to bring the game to its best potential.  All of the links I provided aren't just occasional [strike]bugs[/strike] features that have blipped in and out throughout Fall Guys' lifespan. These have and have always appeared consistently and throughout the game's whole entire lifespan, and have never once been taken out of the game. At best, these can be considered controversial additions to gameplay, and at worst, these are haphazard displays of lack of support and a disconnect from the community to sustain the game properly.   I absolutely adore this game, and have grudged through its tenure in my library balancing the good and the bad. I've been through its original fad status, the lack of updates and disappointing Season 2, the savior of Squads mode reincarnating the game, the custom playlist cycles, and have been a day 1 player in each and every new season. After hundreds of hours, I can definitely mark my feelings down in this review. This is a good game with a horrible company, not malicious or evil, but absurdly lazy to the point that the most dedicated players aren't here just cause they're good - it's that these above experiences are so integrated into daily gameplay that at this point we just don't care anymore."
85835494,english,1,1097150,"this is a great game it has grown tremendously so let me enlighten those people who dropped the game halfway through season one.  1. repetition: the minigames are more diverse than ever, there are so many more minigames than in season 1, especially with the new update. Every show is different from one another especially with all the new side shows.  2. glitches: REDUCED TO ZERO, there are practically no more glitches in season 3 making the playing field even for everyone  3. cost: The cost is much more worth it! multiplayer is more enjoyable, and you get way more minigames and fun for your precious money, I assure you, $20 is a very good price  To sum it up this game is very good, if any of you dropped the game and have not played since season 1, you should change that."
74498736,english,0,1097150,Too many hackers ruin such a silly game.  Only takes one in a batch of 60 to ruin all the fun.  I doubt it will change so unless you like backing out of half the games then I wouldn't spend $20 on this.
84159250,english,1,1097150,"This game is fun, for like a week, and then you let it sleep in your library, updates are very small, could have been a great game... still recommend it because its fun for a few hours."
77491683,english,1,1097150,"The game is great, but the developers should add more maps, and diversify the games."
127472481,english,0,1097150,"I bought 2 DLCs and a lot of skins. When I re-enter the game, I see that my account has been reset. I contacted support and even though they didn't give me any answer, they closed the case as ""closed"". -  MAX EPIC GAMES SUPPORT  [b] 0.1/10 [/b]"

106980784,english,0,1097150,"Due to recent policy changes which involve the incorporation of linking an Epic account, It pains me to no longer be able to recommend this game anymore.  When I bought the game, an account for Epic was not needed. The recent changes mean I can  now no longer play Fall Guys and I will not accept an Epic account being linked to my Steam account.  I refuse to link my Steam account with Epic due to it being nothing more than a privacy invasion and a massive data-grab of Steam users.  When I purchase a game I do so taking the risk whether it is bad or not, that I accept, but to bring in account linking and passing information to another separate service AFTER my purchase, thereby changing my aggreement, that's just plain wrong."

93023172,english,0,1097150,"I'd love it if I could recommend this game to you people out there. I really do. But if they're going to charge 30 dollars for it, I can't morally tell anyone to buy it. This game is really fun... for the first 3-4 days. Once you get the initial hype out of it, the game just becomes repetetive and annoying. Once you get your first win, the game just becomes completely stale. Even with the new maps, I find myself playing cheap knockoffs more often than the actual game. For a ""chill"" game, most of the stages are just unreasonable punishing and extremely difficult to get any practice in. If you like that and have the budget, go ahead. But if you re just looking for a relaxing challenge to sink some hours into, this game is really just a waste of money. I did enjoy this game, but only for about 5 hours."
74474375,english,1,1097150,"Fall Guys is a  chill and fun game  but it really needs server improvements,workshop map creator and more mini games! It won't last long if developers focus on releasing new  skins and cosmetics instead of new content and improvements."
79039244,english,1,1097150,"[h1] Review[/h1][hr] A game that proves that today great graphics is not a necessary condition for great fun. Banal character controls and banal game mechanics do not disturb in spending long hours during exciting games. The only small drawback may be too bright and candy-like world, which can tire the eyes a bit.

97165034,english,1,1097150,"You know, sometimes people ask me why I chose to get Fall Guy plastic surgery and I can't really give them an answer. It's not because I'm afraid they'll dislike me or think I'm a freak or anything, it's that I just can't pinpoint an answer. I mean, yeah, the sexual attraction was always there, but I don't think that's really it. My dad was an alcoholic. He was never really there, he was always wasting his time and money at the bar. Before he left for the bar, he would always tell me, ""You stay there and play those games and if you're not there when I get back… well boy, there'll be hell to pay"". So I played video games. My favorite game was Fall Guys. I just loved that bean; the way he talked, the way he sang and dance. It was great. I… I guess I looked at Fall Guy as the father I never had. I mean, he taught me how to ride a bike, he taught me how to swim, he taught me everything. But I didn't just want to be LIKE Fall Guy, I wanted to BE him. Well, here I am, Fall Guy. This is me, this is who I was born to be."
107130341,english,0,1097150,Sold out to Epic Games Store. Forces you to create an EGS account and install the launcher. I bought it on Steam to play it on Steam.
78978923,english,1,1097150,Good game to play with friends. Sometimes the physics are annoying but sometimes funny stuff happens. If you get this game you should use a controller because it is way easier than mouse and keyboard. many costumes to equip on your little fall guy including collaboration costumes like godzilla.
