179766981,english,0,1089350,"I put 334 hours into this game playing MyCareer and a little bit of quickplay with friends during college. The MyCareer was amazing - you can pick from a list of nicknames so it feels pretty good. I remember thinking of how improvements to the game could be like, adding button/stick prompts to give interactive high-5s to build team chemistry, or being able to complain to refs, or shove someone, or pick up a tech. Instead, Ronnie 2k (the dude who makes these games) decided to lock me out of my 334 hour MyCareer playthrough to try and make me buy his new online product bloated with microtransactions. Shame. SHAME."

166530481,english,0,1089350,This is a piece of ****. They turned off the servers and now nothing works. Don't buy this because it looks like a scam. I don’t understand why “my career” should always be online and why I can’t use offline mode for this. I will never buy 2k games again
172132220,english,0,1089350,2k is a pathetic company that can't do better games for players to buy the next one so instead they cut the support of the servers only after few years. Seeing that the basketball is in the hands of such a pathetic company makes me wanna vomit:  Disgusting
176660977,english,0,1089350,"The game was fun. My one mistake was not being more aware that the online content being discontinued would mean that I could no longer play My Team or My Career [I naively thought that I could still play My Career, just without the park or court competitions against the other players. I also naively thought that I could still play My Team, just without the triple threat ONLINE or that 12-0 mode, whatever they call it.]  I wasn't very good in the online modes [do not have elite stick skills] so I stuck to most of the offline modes, such as the triple threat offline, the domination, those various challenges against the CPU, and the NBA career.  I don't know if I'll ever get a new version any time soon, as I no longer play as much. It was a great game to play during the lockdowns though!"
191375300,english,0,1089350,Never buying any game anymore of this shit publisher. Not able to play the game anymore is just a great policy to drive gamers away.
187503581,english,0,1089350,"Was looking to play some offline MyCareer but that's not possible as you must be online to do this and obviously 2K has shut down the servers years ago. To hammer the nail even further, the main menu seems to be completely broken.  So if you own this game, don't ever think about downloading it again because it's pretty much unplayable."

190567540,english,1,1089350,"Maybe not the best 2K, but probably the best 2K experience when it was around. Mostly played this on PS4, but this game was awesome during lockdown. Gameplay was very fluid and there are a ton of fun rosters because of how much parity there was in the real NBA at the time. MyTeam was great and had some of the funniest broken cards throughout the year. Park, Pro-Am, REC were all great because of the new MyPlayer creator. Nostalgia probably plays a factor in how well this game is remembered, but it's sad it's now in a mostly unplayable state because 2K shuts down the servers. Still a great game to mod!"
175481047,english,0,1089350,"I hate NBA 2K20 with an intensity that’s hard to put into words - it’s truly insane! This game is complete trash, filled with clunky mechanics, frustrating shooting glitches, and zero innovation. It doesn’t even work half the time, making it more of a chore than a game. The MyCareer mode is painfully shallow, and the constant push for microtransactions feels exploitative. The company is extremely greedy, more interested in squeezing every last dollar out of fans than delivering a quality experience.  Honestly, I can’t imagine even basketball legends like Shaquille O'Neal would call this game anything but trash - he’d probably take a sledgehammer to a copy, smash it to pieces, and then set it aflame! And let’s be real, I wouldn’t be surprised if LeBron James took the DVD and pissed on it! All NBA players would be embarrassed to be associated with this mess.  The company keeps releasing the same game year after year, milking fans dry while delivering nothing new. No one should buy this game! I’d rather burn money, set my house aflame, or destroy all my clothes than endure this mess again. I’d happily shatter every window in my home and watch it be torn down instead of playing this game for another minute.  Letting myself be bitten by a snake sounds more appealing than facing the clunky gameplay and endless glitches. I’d rather stub my toe repeatedly, fail all my exams, or have all my life’s hard work be destroyed than deal with this disaster. I’d even willingly get my leg amputated or spend a week in a jail cell rather than suffer through NBA 2K20. Honestly, I’d rather be eaten by lions than put up with this game!  I’d gladly take a sledgehammer to my TV, dig a hole in my backyard, or scrub my floors with a toothbrush just to escape this non-functional mess. Cleaning out a filthy garage, organizing my sock drawer, or listening to elevator music for hours sounds like a welcome distraction. The thought of watching paint dry or listening to a lecture on tax law feels like a treat compared to this. I’d rather clean my gutters, deal with a flat tire, or spend an entire weekend cleaning the attic than endure NBA 2K20.  It’s an insult to basketball fans everywhere, and it deserves to be buried and forgotten! Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this game - it’s nothing more than a cash grab wrapped in flashy graphics!"

182011103,english,1,1089350,"A well calculated game...  NBA 2K20 continues the franchise’s tradition of delivering a highly realistic basketball simulation, with stellar visuals, tight gameplay, and robust content. However, it’s not without its flaws.  Pros: Gameplay Mechanics: Smooth and responsive controls make dribbling, passing, and shooting feel intuitive. AI improvements enhance realism in both offense and defense. Graphics and Presentation: Stunning visuals and lifelike player animations capture the essence of the NBA, while dynamic commentary keeps the experience immersive. MyCareer Mode: A compelling storyline with celebrity involvement adds depth, alongside satisfying customization options for your player. Variety of Modes: From MyTeam to MyLeague, there’s plenty of content to keep players engaged, whether you prefer competitive online play or managing a franchise.  Cons: Microtransactions: Heavy reliance on in-game purchases in modes like MyTeam and MyCareer detracts from the enjoyment, especially for casual players. Repetitiveness: Despite small updates, gameplay can feel overly familiar for long-time fans. Server Issues: Online connectivity remains inconsistent, which can be frustrating for multiplayer enthusiasts.  Verdict: NBA 2K20 shines in gameplay and presentation but stumbles with aggressive monetization and recurring technical hiccups. It’s an excellent choice for basketball fans who can overlook its shortcomings. Rating: 7.5/10."
179915710,english,0,1089350,"NBA 2K20 has received overwhelmingly negative reviews, becoming the 5th lowest-rated game on Steam. Bugs and Technical Issues There are numerous bugs and technical problems that hamper the gaming experience. There are tons of graphical performance issues, with some users noting that the game looks less crisp and polished compared to its console counterparts. Performance problems and lag have also been mentioned, affecting gameplay smoothness and responsiveness. One of the most prevalent complaints is the rampant cheating in online modes. Only the PC version is plagued by hackers, significantly diminishing the enjoyment of multiplayer gameplay. The lack of effective anti-cheating measures has led to a toxic online environment, with many users exploiting the game's vulnerabilities. 2K Games has been criticized for their insufficient efforts to combat cheating. The absence of robust anti-cheat systems has allowed hackers to run rampant, particularly in online modes. This issue has persisted across multiple iterations of the game, leading to frustration among legitimate players seeking fair competition. The combination of bugs, cheaters, and lack of anti-cheat measures has severely impacted the overall gaming experience. While some players find enjoyment in single-player modes like MyCareer and MyLeague, the online component of NBA 2K20 on PC is frustrating and unbalanced due to the prevalence of cheaters. In conclusion, NBA 2K20 for PC has been marred by technical issues, rampant cheating, and inadequate developer response to these problems. While the game may offer some enjoyment in its offline modes, the online experience falls short of expectations due to the lack of effective anti-cheating measures and the resulting toxic environment."

The short version. nba 2k = linear if you want excitement better tape sparklers to your fingers! what we need is nba jam 2: Mantle Breakdown!!!! !!!! you know, if you like b-ball and want to support the players then youd prob be better not buying this, most these games the players dont get a dime for this anyway! or 90% off!  End.  so these game arnt the most playable of b-ball games, as far as i can see the only reason these games exist is for fans to buy one with the likeness of the players they love but considering they dont really get any cash or support from that, instead some fat, rich, son of as bitch is that lil bit rounder. why bother?? the game play aint special. I mean if you want a game that really secures the excitement of the sacred smouldering rock the ONLY CONTENDER IS NBA JAM the original the best the 1 true flamming rock of freedom and dunk truth!!  same with football  though footballers in uk do get insane money for playing, no 1 buys a football game cause its so playable ahah nope, its because people worship the ground that these players walk on, yet the most fun football game for me was made in the 90s and goes by Cannon fodder Vs sensible soccer (Amiga)  I think the main diff in playablity is back in the day most games where made by thinking of specific joy associated with an experience and then the translation of that feeling to an experience of play that creates the same elation in a couch analog XP but in a fun way!  Thing is they didnt have flashy graphics or lure of prosthetic stash greed grabs or any of the other anolog anologs that replace mechanics of joy! the game was built around the feeling they engineered as a mechanic. wich to me is worth more than this  basically if you took the sides off a chess board, the urgency for involvement looses its need, movement seems pointless after awhile & eventually all the pieces would just go home, why havent we?  The thought behind the feeling of the old classics is what creates happy couch bouncing mania, question.. if u nudge yr friends pad will he laugh and carry on? meanwhile with this 1 after time there is a resounding pitch in my head resonating like background static feedback through speakers that my mind has chosen, not so subtly to accompany with cricket leg rubbing! it compels me to turn the game Off!

54998483,english,0,1089350,"Wow.   So, let me just start off by saying, I really don't care at all for the MyCareer/MyTeam aspects of this (anymore) thanks to 2K monetizing it and making it grindy (not to mention the cringe-worthy storylines and dialog). My bread and butter is really MyGM mode. MyLeague would be my preferred option, except every 2K for the last several years has bare-boned MyLeague in favor of MyGM, leaving out crucial features like morale changes (I benched Russ the entire first half of this season to test for instance, and his morale didn't drop one bit in MyLeague), not to mention other features such as badges on staff and other aspects. So really, there is no ""perfect"" mode for me, thanks to how 2K has broken these modes apart.   Anyway, so the last several years I've been playing MyGM, because with all its flaws, it's still at the best experience available (unfortunately). 2K19's MyGM was actually fairly decent, it gave us most of the options available in MyLeague, while still retaining its own feel. It was fine. Apparently that wasn't going to fly with 2K.  So fast-forward to 2K20. MyGM has been bastardized and is TOTAL GARBAGE. Gone is the ability to edit your players -- AT ALL. Want to change Ben Simmons from a PG to a SF? Can't do it. Want to make AD a PF instead of Center since LA already has Boogie and Dwight at Center? Nope, not anymore.  The entire ""edit player"" option is gone in MyGM. You can no longer edit a player's number (so now if a goofy new player comes to OKC and takes #0, well, even though it's unrealistic, you're stuck with it). You can no longer designate a player as a playmaker in the edit settings. You can no longer edit their accessories. You can no longer do ANYTHING we could previously do in those settings in other iterations -- it's totally gone. I get removing the ability to edit other teams players, admittedly there were ways to really cheese the system last year, such as changing other teams' players that you wanted to crazy positions (like Andre Drummond as a PG) in order to make them tradeable, so if they had removed the ability to edit other teams' players, I would be ok with that. But you are telling me as a GM, I can't change the positions of my own players to evolve with my team? What?!   On top of that, you can no longer use a custom roster anymore. Honestly, I wouldn't care much about this personally, the only reason I use it is because 2K still lists KD as 6'9, despite the fact he is clearly not and has admitted so himself, so it looks goofy seeing him next to Giannis who is 2"" taller than him in the game, even though they are the same height in real life.    Also, another HUGE missing feature, is that I can no longer set the quarter length, or sim the games I play to have realistic minutes and stats, so now everything is off if I decide to play my own games (which if you don't, what is even the point of playing?). Why was this removed? It makes no damn sense. We can no longer make any other difficulty edits, other than a generic (and totally vague and unhelpful) option to select an easy, medium, or hard difficulty at the beginning, and that's it.    And don't even get me started on the new ""action point"" system. I still don't understand it, and it still makes no sense, but I can already tell it's awful. Apparently, you have to do something every single day if you want to be able to even play a game -- I can't even just fucking select a game to play on the calendar anymore, it won't let me. I have to do BS tasks and other things each day just to advance. The NBA season is long! I don't want to literally do hundreds of things that are mostly meaningless every season just to be able to play games I want to play.    There's a lot of other things I am forgetting in the heat of the moment, and I may come back and edit this as I remember/discover more.   But the main takeaway is that this game has been severely stripped down from the MyGM aspect, to the point that it is pretty much unplayable. Again, none of this would be an issue if MyLeague were given the same basic features and systems that MyGM has, such as working player morale, coaching badges, a feeling that players actually care what you do, etc, but that has been neglected for years by 2K. I suspect it's because they want people playing only modes which include options to spend VC, and if you can customize the game mode to make the league how you want it, how are they going to get money out of you?   This game is really gross. I'm going to give MyGM a while longer, but I may legit ask for a refund. I keep asking myself ""why"" throughout my experience with this game. MyGM was fixed and fine last year, WHY did they strip it down and make it so restrictive? Restrictive and prohibitive is the best way to describe it.   I won't be buying 2K next year. I'll wait until a decent version is cracked, and then just grab it that way. I don't care for any of the online BS because it's already been turned into a grindfest in order to milk money out of people for a game they already paid for, so in my eyes 2K did this to themselves. What a gross and disgusting company.   Stay away from this game.    Also, as I saw a few other people mention, this is literally such a copy-paste of 2K19, that as of this moment, the icon in the task bar when it's running still shows the 2K19 version. LMAO"
71005835,english,0,1089350,"This game sucks.  I only bought it because I like career mode and this years NBA roster is the most competitive it has been in a long time. Like almost 90% of the other reviews this is a legit copy of 2k19. The only difference is the new way to build your characters which granted is cool and works well. Everything else sucks. The AI is one of the worst things I have ever seen in a video game. You can have Anthony Davis who is 97 in my career mode and he goes like 1-10 in the paint against Trae young. That's not even a joke. The AI almost never posts up or do any good moves, if you pass them the ball in the paint they will take the ugliest most contested shot right away with like 15 seconds left on the shot clock. This would be fine if they were like 80 overall but we are talking about the Player that's on the cover of your game. They refuse to add more features and or fix anything. I understand that career mode is not as profitable but this company make an insane amount of cash on this game and as consumers we deserve a better product.  Dont buy this game if already own a 2K game made in the last 5 years. You're wasting your money and you only give them the power to continue to improve nothing about their games. Idiots like myself and other ""loyal"" fans are the reason these games never improve. This is the last 2k game I buy until they actually improve any aspect of gameplay."
55041396,english,0,1089350,"So first off, I'm a fool for buying the game this year. No way around it.   Now lets get to the game itself.  From my 7-8 hours of gameplay, i still see the same issues that the last few editions had. Let's name a few.   Disliked the archetype system? Well this year that's changed, into the exact same thing without the names. There's literally no difference, except instead of sharpshooter/slasher/defender/etc, you now have pie charts that does the exact same thing. Want a Melo clone? Well fuck you, have a watered down version that either doesn't know how to finish at the rim, shoot 3's, post up or have a ball handling stat that will enable you to go by terrible defenders. Chose 2, and forget all about defence.  Wanna make a fucking Terrence Ross? Well pick between Dunks, 3pt and finishing at the rim. You can't have all 3.   Wanna double team? You'll get minus point for leaving your assignment. Doesn't matter if you get a steal and win the game because of it. You left a person open, so the game will fault you for it.   Got less than 70 in block rating? Your character will jump AWAY from the ball. I've played and trained basketball for tiny people. Even the 8 year olds know to jump TOWARDS the ball.   Dislike cutscenes? Well bohoo. This game will force you to watch them.   Liked last years choices when it came to MyGM? well fuck you, this year you only get the storied version that nobody liked in 2k19.  I could go on and on and on and on and .... But seriously, we all knew this was gonna be the game. 1 step forward 1 step back. Of course if you expect any focus on online play and hackers, well you're as big an idiot as i was.   I realise my next words are gonna sound cliché, but I won't be buying 2k games for a few years.  I shouldn't have bought it this year, but i somehow fell for their marketing tricks and decided to give them 1 last chance. And holy fuck do i regret doing so.   This is a trash game made by a trash developer, produced by a trash production team.   It's trash.  1st Edit: So i've played a bit more, and i've encountered so many other issues, that i think i need to keep going with this. Bear in mind that these are all bugs that were in previous years editions too.  If you pass and the ball even scratches a player on the opposite team, it's about 50-50 if it'll count as a turnover or not. Doesn't matter if they actually had control over the ball or not.   I'm currently an 80 overall, despite not having a single attribute above 70, and alot of my attributes being below 50. So this year we're able to play as the most overrated NBA star to ever grace the earth. Thanks 2K, you sure know how to give people what they want.   Demarcus Cousins. So his injury apparently affected his shooting mostly, since he's now in the mid 60's on open 3 pointers, and high 50's on open midrange shots. Of course we all know lower body injuries fuck with your hands.  But in that case they must have changed his tendencies too right? Nope. Every time i pass to him, he takes the jumper and of course misses. He might honestly be the worst player in the game right now, considering his stats vs tendencies.   Teammates don't run their lanes or roll towards the basket. The amount of times a teammate will move to my exact position instead of rolling to an open basket is like 99% of the time.   I'm using a Dualshock 4 Controller, and despite it being fully supported on the PS4, it's still not fully supported on PC. The game tells me to pass by pressing ""A"" despite my controller not having any ""A's""."

60434533,english,0,1089350,"Due to the reviews, I wasn't expected much. But I gotta admit, I have played this game (mostly MyCareer) a lot and enjoyed it more it than I expected. Despite that, there are some glaring issues that need to be fixed.  These are just some I can come up of the top of my head: - Whenever you set the refresh rate above 60Hz (for example 144Hz, or in my case, 240Hz), it causes a game-breaking bug where, in MyCareer, you cannot skip part of the gameplay (simulate the game until next appearance) when you get subbed out. You have to basically have to sit and watch your A.I teammates play for 5-6 minutes every game. There are some workarounds, set the refresh rate back to 60Hz (which kinda suck cause I bought this game to pay in high refresh rate) or ALT-TAB several times until you can sub in.  - This game constantly crashes on my PC. I tried everything, re-installing the GPU driver, re-installing game, checked for missing game files, change in-game setting, updating windows, nothing works. My PC Spec is far above the recommended requirements (3900x + 2080ti).  - The game is basically the same as 2k19, same engine, same graphics, just a little upgrade on the User Interfaces.  - You can basically pay-to-win on this game. It is filled to the brim with micro-transactions.  - You cannot access MyPlayerNation, 2KLeague and Ruffles rewards on PC Versions (Unlike the ones on consoles)  In conclusion, NBA2K19 V2 is not worth 80 CAD. Don't buy it (unless it's at least 95% off). You can get a lot of burritos for $80"
84029737,english,0,1089350,I only play this game because I love basketball. 2k is one of the worst companies in the entire world. Next gen isnt even coming to PC even tho it was programmed on a damn pc. Its pathetic. Only buy a 2k game when its 80% off or more. Do not support 2k and their piece of shit bosses
71296009,english,0,1089350,"Here is my honest assessment of the 2K series and this game. I read most of the bad reviews and I read most of the good reviews prior to buying this game. I have not owned or played NBA 2K since 2K16. So I decided to buy this game when it was on sale. I can honestly say that I will never buy another NBA 2K game ever again without some serious changes. This game at its core has not changed much since 2K16. This port for PC is really awful. If you're trying to play online then you are just wasting your time, between the input lag, the net code, and the 2K servers, the online play is dreadful. One of the biggest reason why I quit playing NBA 2K was because the servers were not good. They have not been good the past few years and this year was the worst I have experienced by far. I have watched countless hours of YouTuber's who play this game and it looks bad for them too, I will say that online play seems to run a little smoother on PS4 and Xbox but I am only saying that cause of the  YouTube videos I have seen. I don't know why the online connections on PC are so bad but it is unplayable. Outside of the 2K servers, the other reason I will never buy another NBA 2K game again unless changes are made, is because of all the microtransactions. All 2K cares about is money. Everything you do in this game involves money. I personally have only played MyTeam mode. I read to many horror stories about the other online game modes, so I stuck with MyTeam only.   This mode could be a lot better. If you are a player that chooses not to pay money, then you are in for one long grind. The sad part about the grind is, outside of the GOAT Galaxy Opal Kobe card, the rewards you get are not really worth grinding for. As mentioned previously, I can never connect to matches and if I do, it is a lag fest the whole time. You will also notice as a non-paying player that you will be at an extreme disadvantage against paying players. No matter your skill level, if someone has a stacked team, 9 times out of 10 they will beat you, and there is not a whole lot that can be done about it, and it is all because they bought it and it is another ploy from 2K to try and get you to spend money. I will admit that I have a good paying job, so it sadly affords me the opportunity to indulge myself on needless expenses, such as buying VC for packs. Be that as it may, getting such a late start to MyTeam, kind of forces you to pay if I want to get good players in a limited time. To those that wonder if paying money for VC to buy packs is worth it, I will tell you it is not. That is another reason why I feel cheated with this NBA 2K game. Even when you decide to spend money on the game, the pack odds are terrible. The chances of pulling the same duplicate cards seems to be a lot higher than need to be and at the end of the day, if you do pull a Galaxy Opal, chances are it is going to be the worst one. The amount of money that I have spent in the little I have played this game is not worth the rewards that you get. The offline modes would be better, but as I have seen in several reviews, the input lag on PC is bad. The players go out of their way to do the weirdest moves on the simplest of commands. Unless I am wide open and not moving, almost every shot has a delay, and it is multiplied by a 1000 when playing online.   If you read this far, then you've probable guessed that I am just writing this review because I am annoyed at spending money and not getting the best players. That may have been very annoying for me, I just wanted to tell you the truth from someone who isn't paid to write nice things about this game, my assessment is true. I am not a YouTuber, and I am not a Streamer, I am just that regular everyday person who really wanted this game to be good, and  it just isn't which is sad. I promise I don't regret spending the money on the packs, my annoyance with that is that the pack odds seems to favor 2K and again- their idea of making money off people. Plain and simple please stop buying 2K games and spending your money on this company. At the end of the day this company cares about one thing, and that is themselves. They make billions of dollars from players every year, and every year this game does not improve, mainly their servers, what could be the best aspect of this game, playing online with your buddy from across the country, turns into an unplayable lag fest. Never invest your time or money into a company that is littered with microtransactions and allows people to be pay to win. I just wish NBA Live would return and be somewhat decent, that may give 2K a reason to go back and do better and realize what use to make this game fun in the first place. Do Not Buy."

If you would just show the PC version the same attention as console the game could be playable.  2k has been and always will be all about the money and not about the fucking people that are about playing the game for fun and its ridiculous.  I will never buy another 2k game until they get their shit together. fuck this piece of shit game and all the faggot modders that get a hard on from being good at the game because of cheat engine.

Unless you buy Virtual Currency in the game you get destroyed. Game is built to bleed real life money from online players instead of offering a pleasurable experience to a single player campaign or story line.  I left a bad review for 2k19 and no one listened, this game is exactly the same, why would I pay for the exact same game. Im so disappointed I don't ever want to play NBA 2k again and i'm a life long fan since 2000. Make a game that delivers enjoyment not monetization. THIS IS NOT A MOBILE APP STOP TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF PEOPLE AFTER A RETAIL PURCHASE.  I've refunded my purchase of the legendary edition. Will not buy 2k20 until the 1-10 dollar sale day in a year.

66037976,english,0,1089350,"If you're a MyCareer player, like me, expect to be sorely disappointed by the quality of this game.  The CPU players routinely make inexplicable decisions, especially on defense, and you will often find your team perfectly set defensively, only for one of your teammates to suddenly leave a 3-point shooter wide open because he wants to switch the match-up. This has been a problem since NBA 2k17, and I don't think it will change for a very long time. While I appreciated NBA 2k19 for the quality of the collisions, NBA 2k20 has gone backwards massively, and you will often see players going through each other. For example, you will see a defender's hand go through the ball as he's trying to block a shot (without a block registering), or you might find yourself in perfect position to defend, only for the ball handler to go through you and find himself wide open in front of the basket. The way in which the game plays is extremely unrealistic. All teams play exactly the same offensively, i.e. the ball handler gets the ball, he triggers some useless offensive motion, then sits around while the shot clock counts down and then shoots a contested jumper. Defensively there are only minor differences related to how they treat pick and rolls and mismatches. Hall of fame difficulty, just like previous years, turns your teammates into secondary school calibre players, unable to make even the simplest plays, like pass to a wide open teammate, knock down open jumpers (which especially applies to top tier shooters), and sometimes refuse to shoot an open layup in front of the basket, instead preferring to make 2-3 useless pump fakes, during which the defender gets back into position, and then air-ball a contested layup. Conversely, the Hall of Fame CPU is moved into a Godlike tier. Do not be mistaken, this does not mean they are smarter, or more skilled. They still trigger useless offense, and run around with no purpose, however, they just make impossible plays. There is the classic example of the heavily contested three as the shot clock winds down, but even if that misses, you will find that the HOF CPU will dominate the boards, and will have a 99% chance of boxing out the defending rebounder. This applies regardless of who is fighting for the rebound, so a player like Jayson Tatum will somehow manage to push Andre Drummond out of the way and grab an improbable rebound, then dunk the ball like Shaq. Instead of making the experience of playing on Hall of Fame fun and challenging, they just made it purely frustrating and unrealistic and I do not recommend anyone to buy this game, unless they wish to try other modes."

Had an error during a Trivia event, sent in a ticket and they basically told me ""Too bad, you will have to wait until the next Trivia to try again"". Didn't buy 2K19, thought this was going to be different but made that mistake. Also to add to the love for 2K, these morons advertised ""MyPlayer Nation"", a MyCareer add-on at the start of the NBA season and guess what? PC players can kindly take a middle finger. We pay the same price as XBOX and PS4 yet we don't get the complete game. Well played 2K, 10/10 most ruthless company ever."
71338189,english,1,1089350,"The game is great offline.  I understand people are mad at the MyCareer and the multiplayer. If you just want to sit back, relax, and enjoy basketball, this is it.  If you wanted to play MyCareer but don't want to invest in a player, just play MyLeague and use ""player lock"". Create your character, customize however you like and enjoy.  Online play is non-existent. Don't even bother.  The increased difficulty in MyLeague make me want to come back to the game mode every single time I play. 2K have nerfed some parts of the stat system like a players potential. Someone who's A+ in potential may only shine if he has players who revolve around his play-style. Although, I find that you need a star in order to win a championship. Mediocre 80 overalls won't get you anywhere but the second round.  Virtual currency is very lenient this game. You can get an easy 1500 each game. They implemented a progression feature with the MyCareer character that allows you to progress through basketball. The progression blocks the player from increasing overalls. But, it allows the character to develop in a realistic fashion, although, very grindy. That's why I mentioned the MyLeague option.  If you enjoy basketball and offline play, it's something to look forward to when it's on sale. Looking for multiplayer?

Wanna try another player? Well, good luck, that's another 200 hours.  The game is designed around the concept of having A TON of tedious tasks (mainly pressing A to skip).

No matter what 2K promises the servers will never be good, because if 2K can manage to save any money for in exchange for in game performance, you'll be safe to bet a billion dollars that they will surrender customer experience for MONEY. Shot contest is a joke. You can contest a shot / layup and be given 'good shot contest' only for the shot to go in.   Don't buy the game now. Wait until next year. The game will be much more polished ( hopefully ) and you will have a better experience compared to buying it right now.   In totality, 2K is so out of touch with their community and game.

I've literally watched shots that were perfect jump out of the hoop, breaking the games physics because it was determined by a number it wasnt good. Everything about this games design is made to make you spend extra money on a $60 or more purchase and with 2k21 even worse and costing $70 at base, 2k is probably more predatory and worse than EA at this point.

70878259,english,1,1089350,"[list] [h1]🔹Positive Aspects:[/h1] [*]Impressive visuals and face scans. [*]Huge variety in modes. [*]Soundtrack. [*]Best gameplay as far as basketball games go.  [h1]🔸Negative Aspects:[/h1] [*]Servers. [*]Major gameplay inconsistencies. [*]MyCareer is basically a grind game.   [h1]▶️Introduction[/h1] NBA 2K20 is the latest addition to the NBA 2K lineup which exists for almost 2 decades now. The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/2K]2K.[/url]  Release Date : 5th September 2019. Last known update: 29th May 2020.   [h1]🎮Gameplay:[/h1]  [b]Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?[/b]  [list] [*] [b]Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:[/b] Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasn’t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.  [*] [b]Gamemodes:[/b] [i][b]Play Now[/b][/i]: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include [b]Play WNBA[/b] that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, [b]NBA Today[/b] that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,[b]Play Now Online[/b] is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly [b]Blacktop[/b] which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to. [i][b]My Team[/b][/i]: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed. [i][b]My Career[/b][/i]: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and you’re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues. [i][b]My League[/b][/i]: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. [b]My GM[/b] Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.  [h1]🌇Graphics / Audio:[/h1] Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals. [list] [*] [b]Graphics:[/b]  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1865032563  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1859551512  [*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack:[/b] The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well. [/list]  [h1]🌀Performance:[/h1] [b][/b] [*] [b]In Game:[/b] AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S: I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the cap  Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500: Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.  [*] [b]🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b] The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues. [/list]  [h1]💲Price:[/h1] For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.  [h1]⚖️Conclusion:[/h1] NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.

58646642,english,1,1089350,"90% of what I play in this game is single player. I have read reviews about the multiplayer being filled with bugs and I can't speak to that. I also only paid $30 for it which I feel is fair. You know what you get with NBA2k: an unethical $60 price tag for a game that should be free to play with all the microtransactions. If you are a fan of the last 4 2k games nothing in this one will surprise you, but you're likely to like this one as well. Same game as the last one, same microtransactions as the last one, still fun for an NBA fan imo. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME."

64263070,english,0,1089350,"I don't often take time to review games on Steam, but this needs to be said. This game is a huge piece of garbage. I fully expected coming in that this would basically be a re-release of an old game with new rosters. That's just what these sports games are, yet people pluck them up for $60 every year.  I picked this up on sale for $20, so I was pretty tolerant of issues coming in. In short, this game is a [b]nearly unplayable buggy Gatorade/Beats/Express commercial[/b]. Hell, for all the in your face product placement (way more than you think) this may as well be free to play. This review sponsored by Gatorade GX, change the way you refuel. Beats.  Bugs: Here are just a few of the bugs you can expect to see: [list]   [*]Seemingly random crashes to desktop at any given moment. Especially fun after you've played 30+ minutes of your MyCareer game and you lose all your progress.   [*] If you set your refresh rate to anything higher than the 60hz default, then when you simulate to your next appearance in a MyCareer game, the game slows down to a crawl. It will not begin simulating until after about 1 minute of this and/or after you alt+tab a few times to ""kick start"" it.   [*] Online neighborhood games are often a lagfest, and there is a constant underlying latency added to your shot timing. Essentially you need to completely re-adjust how you shoot when playing online. This isn't game breaking, but it sure as hell is annoying. [/list]  Other comments:  In fairness to this game, when the MyCareer isn't crashing, it's actually quite fun. You can tell they expect you to grind to become a half decent player, and that feels a little more heavy handed than older versions I've played. This is likely a ploy to get you to spend your hard earned money on more VC so that you can actually compete, but to be honest it didn't take that much work for me to get to an 80 overall, and with smart play you can still be a competent player. Also, all of my experience has been in MyCareer mode. I've heard MyLeague/MyTeam are fun, and I can't personally attest to how stable those modes are. But know that if MyCareer is what you are after, you are probably going to be frustrated.  Honestly, for a game that does so little to innovate every year, you would think they would at least fix the bugs. However, they still sell every year without fixing anything so I won't hold my breath. I should note that when googling the random crash to desktop issue, I've found forum posts from NBA2K18 complaining about the same issue. Awesome.  Final Verdict: Don't buy this POS on Steam. The PC version isn't stable enough for an early access alpha let alone a ""AAA"" release. If you must play this game, I highly recommend you get it on console. I assume it actually functions there."
63411931,english,0,1089350,"I actually enjoy the game. I mainly play MyLeague. My problem is that the steam version constantly crashes during games without even an error message. I will play 47 minutes of a game and it will crash and I will end up simulating/replaying the game I just about finished. (very annoying) There are some other issues with the game as far as lacking design and features. (For example, you must select your favorite offensive plays at the start of each game. Those settings should persist between games in my opinion) They are not deal breakers, but the crashing bugs are not enough for me to choose the steam or pc versions over the Xbox/PlayStation versions. (Assuming those don't crash)"
54990744,english,0,1089350,"I sadly cannot recommend this game at this time.  The game makers should be embarrassed.  Steam should be embarrassed they sold this crap.  Right now, in its current state, the game is not at all playable.   The first thing you notice is it takes forever just to connect after you download.   When you get into the game, even on my 4K computer, it runs with latency.  At 4k resolution, the game will not let you run faster than 30 mhz refresh rate.  At 60 mhz and at about half resolution, the frame rate is terrible even on low settings.  The game videos do not play but instead give you a choppy green screen.  If you get passed all that and can get to MyPlayer and make a character, you'll find more issues.  The menus do not always work. Especially when simply trying to exit. Hit A. Nothing happens. You have to minimize and then close the application and restart.  So you're building a player. Sometimes it will let you choose what he looks like and sometimes it'll just send you straight to ability making.  After you choose your position, your ratings for various stats, etc, and you save your player, when you go to load it, you will something else. Like I made a Shooting Guard that can Slash to the basket. I ended up with a Small Forward with a different ability. I made a center playmaker and ended up with a Center paint defender.   With my center, I was shooting deep 3's and did not miss a single shot. On either player I created, I did not miss a shot. I did not play very many minutes, but still did not miss a shot in maybe a dozen or more attempts.   After all of this, I decided to ask for a refund, so unaware of what other problems there lies in other modes of the game or further along in a game or in MyStory mode beyond a few minutes. I am sure there are other issues.   This has been my experience with this product."
179766981,english,0,1089350,"I put 334 hours into this game playing MyCareer and a little bit of quickplay with friends during college. The MyCareer was amazing - you can pick from a list of nicknames so it feels pretty good. I remember thinking of how improvements to the game could be like, adding button/stick prompts to give interactive high-5s to build team chemistry, or being able to complain to refs, or shove someone, or pick up a tech. Instead, Ronnie 2k (the dude who makes these games) decided to lock me out of my 334 hour MyCareer playthrough to try and make me buy his new online product bloated with microtransactions. Shame.

I shouldn't have to grind copious amounts of time just to get the badge to HOF which is the only badge level that shoots relatively reasonable (still way too slow).

I don't play MyTeam so I wouldn't know what to say about that because I'm not paying one cent to any company that will turn into gambling.

So, let me just start off by saying, I really don't care at all for the MyCareer/MyTeam aspects of this (anymore) thanks to 2K monetizing it and making it grindy (not to mention the cringe-worthy storylines and dialog). My bread and butter is really MyGM mode. MyLeague would be my preferred option, except every 2K for the last several years has bare-boned MyLeague in favor of MyGM, leaving out crucial features like morale changes (I benched Russ the entire first half of this season to test for instance, and his morale didn't drop one bit in MyLeague), not to mention other features such as badges on staff and other aspects. So really, there is no ""perfect"" mode for me, thanks to how 2K has broken these modes apart.   Anyway, so the last several years I've been playing MyGM, because with all its flaws, it's still at the best experience available (unfortunately). 2K19's MyGM was actually fairly decent, it gave us most of the options available in MyLeague, while still retaining its own feel. It was fine. Apparently that wasn't going to fly with 2K.  So fast-forward to 2K20. MyGM has been bastardized and is TOTAL GARBAGE. Gone is the ability to edit your players -- AT ALL. Want to change Ben Simmons from a PG to a SF? Can't do it. Want to make AD a PF instead of Center since LA already has Boogie and Dwight at Center? Nope, not anymore.  The entire ""edit player"" option is gone in MyGM. You can no longer edit a player's number (so now if a goofy new player comes to OKC and takes #0, well, even though it's unrealistic, you're stuck with it). You can no longer designate a player as a playmaker in the edit settings. You can no longer edit their accessories. You can no longer do ANYTHING we could previously do in those settings in other iterations -- it's totally gone. I get removing the ability to edit other teams players, admittedly there were ways to really cheese the system last year, such as changing other teams' players that you wanted to crazy positions (like Andre Drummond as a PG) in order to make them tradeable, so if they had removed the ability to edit other teams' players, I would be ok with that. But you are telling me as a GM, I can't change the positions of my own players to evolve with my team? What?!   On top of that, you can no longer use a custom roster anymore. Honestly, I wouldn't care much about this personally, the only reason I use it is because 2K still lists KD as 6'9, despite the fact he is clearly not and has admitted so himself, so it looks goofy seeing him next to Giannis who is 2"" taller than him in the game, even though they are the same height in real life.    Also, another HUGE missing feature, is that I can no longer set the quarter length, or sim the games I play to have realistic minutes and stats, so now everything is off if I decide to play my own games (which if you don't, what is even the point of playing?). Why was this removed? It makes no damn sense. We can no longer make any other difficulty edits, other than a generic (and totally vague and unhelpful) option to select an easy, medium, or hard difficulty at the beginning, and that's it.    And don't even get me started on the new ""action point"" system. I still don't understand it, and it still makes no sense, but I can already tell it's awful. Apparently, you have to do something every single day if you want to be able to even play a game -- I can't even just fucking select a game to play on the calendar anymore, it won't let me. I have to do BS tasks and other things each day just to advance. The NBA season is long! I don't want to literally do hundreds of things that are mostly meaningless every season just to be able to play games I want to play.    There's a lot of other things I am forgetting in the heat of the moment, and I may come back and edit this as I remember/discover more.   But the main takeaway is that this game has been severely stripped down from the MyGM aspect, to the point that it is pretty much unplayable. Again, none of this would be an issue if MyLeague were given the same basic features and systems that MyGM has, such as working player morale, coaching badges, a feeling that players actually care what you do, etc, but that has been neglected for years by 2K. I suspect it's because they want people playing only modes which include options to spend VC, and if you can customize the game mode to make the league how you want it, how are they going to get money out of you?   This game is really gross. I'm going to give MyGM a while longer, but I may legit ask for a refund. I keep asking myself ""why"" throughout my experience with this game. MyGM was fixed and fine last year, WHY did they strip it down and make it so restrictive? Restrictive and prohibitive is the best way to describe it.   I won't be buying 2K next year. I'll wait until a decent version is cracked, and then just grab it that way. I don't care for any of the online BS because it's already been turned into a grindfest in order to milk money out of people for a game they already paid for, so in my eyes 2K did this to themselves. What a gross and disgusting company.   Stay away from this game.    Also, as I saw a few other people mention, this is literally such a copy-paste of 2K19, that as of this moment, the icon in the task bar when it's running still shows the 2K19 version. LMAO"
71005835,english,0,1089350,"This game sucks.  I only bought it because I like career mode and this years NBA roster is the most competitive it has been in a long time. Like almost 90% of the other reviews this is a legit copy of 2k19. The only difference is the new way to build your characters which granted is cool and works well. Everything else sucks. The AI is one of the worst things I have ever seen in a video game. You can have Anthony Davis who is 97 in my career mode and he goes like 1-10 in the paint against Trae young. That's not even a joke. The AI almost never posts up or do any good moves, if you pass them the ball in the paint they will take the ugliest most contested shot right away with like 15 seconds left on the shot clock. This would be fine if they were like 80 overall but we are talking about the Player that's on the cover of your game. They refuse to add more features and or fix anything. I understand that career mode is not as profitable but this company make an insane amount of cash on this game and as consumers we deserve a better product.  Dont buy this game if already own a 2K game made in the last 5 years. You're wasting your money and you only give them the power to continue to improve nothing about their games. Idiots like myself and other ""loyal"" fans are the reason these games never improve. This is the last 2k game I buy until they actually improve any aspect of gameplay."
55041396,english,0,1089350,"So first off, I'm a fool for buying the game this year. No way around it.   Now lets get to the game itself.  From my 7-8 hours of gameplay, i still see the same issues that the last few editions had. Let's name a few.   Disliked the archetype system? Well this year that's changed, into the exact same thing without the names. There's literally no difference, except instead of sharpshooter/slasher/defender/etc, you now have pie charts that does the exact same thing. Want a Melo clone? Well fuck you, have a watered down version that either doesn't know how to finish at the rim, shoot 3's, post up or have a ball handling stat that will enable you to go by terrible defenders. Chose 2, and forget all about defence.  Wanna make a fucking Terrence Ross? Well pick between Dunks, 3pt and finishing at the rim. You can't have all 3.   Wanna double team? You'll get minus point for leaving your assignment. Doesn't matter if you get a steal and win the game because of it. You left a person open, so the game will fault you for it.   Got less than 70 in block rating? Your character will jump AWAY from the ball. I've played and trained basketball for tiny people. Even the 8 year olds know to jump TOWARDS the ball.   Dislike cutscenes? Well bohoo. This game will force you to watch them.   Liked last years choices when it came to MyGM? well fuck you, this year you only get the storied version that nobody liked in 2k19.  I could go on and on and on and on and .... But seriously, we all knew this was gonna be the game. 1 step forward 1 step back. Of course if you expect any focus on online play and hackers, well you're as big an idiot as i was.   I realise my next words are gonna sound cliché, but I won't be buying 2k games for a few years.  I shouldn't have bought it this year, but i somehow fell for their marketing tricks and decided to give them 1 last chance. And holy fuck do i regret doing so.   This is a trash game made by a trash developer, produced by a trash production team.   It's trash.  1st Edit: So i've played a bit more, and i've encountered so many other issues, that i think i need to keep going with this. Bear in mind that these are all bugs that were in previous years editions too.  If you pass and the ball even scratches a player on the opposite team, it's about 50-50 if it'll count as a turnover or not. Doesn't matter if they actually had control over the ball or not.   I'm currently an 80 overall, despite not having a single attribute above 70, and alot of my attributes being below 50. So this year we're able to play as the most overrated NBA star to ever grace the earth. Thanks 2K, you sure know how to give people what they want.   Demarcus Cousins. So his injury apparently affected his shooting mostly, since he's now in the mid 60's on open 3 pointers, and high 50's on open midrange shots. Of course we all know lower body injuries fuck with your hands.  But in that case they must have changed his tendencies too right? Nope. Every time i pass to him, he takes the jumper and of course misses. He might honestly be the worst player in the game right now, considering his stats vs tendencies.   Teammates don't run their lanes or roll towards the basket. The amount of times a teammate will move to my exact position instead of rolling to an open basket is like 99% of the time.   I'm using a Dualshock 4 Controller, and despite it being fully supported on the PS4, it's still not fully supported on PC. The game tells me to pass by pressing ""A"" despite my controller not having any ""A's""."

60434533,english,0,1089350,"Due to the reviews, I wasn't expected much. But I gotta admit, I have played this game (mostly MyCareer) a lot and enjoyed it more it than I expected. Despite that, there are some glaring issues that need to be fixed.  These are just some I can come up of the top of my head: - Whenever you set the refresh rate above 60Hz (for example 144Hz, or in my case, 240Hz), it causes a game-breaking bug where, in MyCareer, you cannot skip part of the gameplay (simulate the game until next appearance) when you get subbed out. You have to basically have to sit and watch your A.I teammates play for 5-6 minutes every game. There are some workarounds, set the refresh rate back to 60Hz (which kinda suck cause I bought this game to pay in high refresh rate) or ALT-TAB several times until you can sub in.  - This game constantly crashes on my PC. I tried everything, re-installing the GPU driver, re-installing game, checked for missing game files, change in-game setting, updating windows, nothing works. My PC Spec is far above the recommended requirements (3900x + 2080ti).  - The game is basically the same as 2k19, same engine, same graphics, just a little upgrade on the User Interfaces.  - You can basically pay-to-win on this game. It is filled to the brim with micro-transactions.  - You cannot access MyPlayerNation, 2KLeague and Ruffles rewards on PC Versions (Unlike the ones on consoles)  In conclusion, NBA2K19 V2 is not worth 80 CAD. Don't buy it (unless it's at least 95% off). You can get a lot of burritos for $80"
84029737,english,0,1089350,I only play this game because I love basketball. 2k is one of the worst companies in the entire world. Next gen isnt even coming to PC even tho it was programmed on a damn pc. Its pathetic. Only buy a 2k game when its 80% off or more. Do not support 2k and their piece of shit bosses
71296009,english,0,1089350,"Here is my honest assessment of the 2K series and this game. I read most of the bad reviews and I read most of the good reviews prior to buying this game. I have not owned or played NBA 2K since 2K16. So I decided to buy this game when it was on sale. I can honestly say that I will never buy another NBA 2K game ever again without some serious changes. This game at its core has not changed much since 2K16. This port for PC is really awful. If you're trying to play online then you are just wasting your time, between the input lag, the net code, and the 2K servers, the online play is dreadful. One of the biggest reason why I quit playing NBA 2K was because the servers were not good. They have not been good the past few years and this year was the worst I have experienced by far. I have watched countless hours of YouTuber's who play this game and it looks bad for them too, I will say that online play seems to run a little smoother on PS4 and Xbox but I am only saying that cause of the  YouTube videos I have seen. I don't know why the online connections on PC are so bad but it is unplayable. Outside of the 2K servers, the other reason I will never buy another NBA 2K game again unless changes are made, is because of all the microtransactions. All 2K cares about is money. Everything you do in this game involves money. I personally have only played MyTeam mode. I read to many horror stories about the other online game modes, so I stuck with MyTeam only.   This mode could be a lot better. If you are a player that chooses not to pay money, then you are in for one long grind. The sad part about the grind is, outside of the GOAT Galaxy Opal Kobe card, the rewards you get are not really worth grinding for. As mentioned previously, I can never connect to matches and if I do, it is a lag fest the whole time. You will also notice as a non-paying player that you will be at an extreme disadvantage against paying players. No matter your skill level, if someone has a stacked team, 9 times out of 10 they will beat you, and there is not a whole lot that can be done about it, and it is all because they bought it and it is another ploy from 2K to try and get you to spend money. I will admit that I have a good paying job, so it sadly affords me the opportunity to indulge myself on needless expenses, such as buying VC for packs. Be that as it may, getting such a late start to MyTeam, kind of forces you to pay if I want to get good players in a limited time. To those that wonder if paying money for VC to buy packs is worth it, I will tell you it is not. That is another reason why I feel cheated with this NBA 2K game. Even when you decide to spend money on the game, the pack odds are terrible. The chances of pulling the same duplicate cards seems to be a lot higher than need to be and at the end of the day, if you do pull a Galaxy Opal, chances are it is going to be the worst one. The amount of money that I have spent in the little I have played this game is not worth the rewards that you get. The offline modes would be better, but as I have seen in several reviews, the input lag on PC is bad. The players go out of their way to do the weirdest moves on the simplest of commands. Unless I am wide open and not moving, almost every shot has a delay, and it is multiplied by a 1000 when playing online.   If you read this far, then you've probable guessed that I am just writing this review because I am annoyed at spending money and not getting the best players. That may have been very annoying for me, I just wanted to tell you the truth from someone who isn't paid to write nice things about this game, my assessment is true. I am not a YouTuber, and I am not a Streamer, I am just that regular everyday person who really wanted this game to be good, and  it just isn't which is sad. I promise I don't regret spending the money on the packs, my annoyance with that is that the pack odds seems to favor 2K and again- their idea of making money off people. Plain and simple please stop buying 2K games and spending your money on this company. At the end of the day this company cares about one thing, and that is themselves. They make billions of dollars from players every year, and every year this game does not improve, mainly their servers, what could be the best aspect of this game, playing online with your buddy from across the country, turns into an unplayable lag fest. Never invest your time or money into a company that is littered with microtransactions and allows people to be pay to win. I just wish NBA Live would return and be somewhat decent, that may give 2K a reason to go back and do better and realize what use to make this game fun in the first place. Do Not Buy."

66037976,english,0,1089350,"If you're a MyCareer player, like me, expect to be sorely disappointed by the quality of this game.  The CPU players routinely make inexplicable decisions, especially on defense, and you will often find your team perfectly set defensively, only for one of your teammates to suddenly leave a 3-point shooter wide open because he wants to switch the match-up. This has been a problem since NBA 2k17, and I don't think it will change for a very long time. While I appreciated NBA 2k19 for the quality of the collisions, NBA 2k20 has gone backwards massively, and you will often see players going through each other. For example, you will see a defender's hand go through the ball as he's trying to block a shot (without a block registering), or you might find yourself in perfect position to defend, only for the ball handler to go through you and find himself wide open in front of the basket. The way in which the game plays is extremely unrealistic. All teams play exactly the same offensively, i.e. the ball handler gets the ball, he triggers some useless offensive motion, then sits around while the shot clock counts down and then shoots a contested jumper. Defensively there are only minor differences related to how they treat pick and rolls and mismatches. Hall of fame difficulty, just like previous years, turns your teammates into secondary school calibre players, unable to make even the simplest plays, like pass to a wide open teammate, knock down open jumpers (which especially applies to top tier shooters), and sometimes refuse to shoot an open layup in front of the basket, instead preferring to make 2-3 useless pump fakes, during which the defender gets back into position, and then air-ball a contested layup. Conversely, the Hall of Fame CPU is moved into a Godlike tier. Do not be mistaken, this does not mean they are smarter, or more skilled. They still trigger useless offense, and run around with no purpose, however, they just make impossible plays. There is the classic example of the heavily contested three as the shot clock winds down, but even if that misses, you will find that the HOF CPU will dominate the boards, and will have a 99% chance of boxing out the defending rebounder. This applies regardless of who is fighting for the rebound, so a player like Jayson Tatum will somehow manage to push Andre Drummond out of the way and grab an improbable rebound, then dunk the ball like Shaq. Instead of making the experience of playing on Hall of Fame fun and challenging, they just made it purely frustrating and unrealistic and I do not recommend anyone to buy this game, unless they wish to try other modes."

71338189,english,1,1089350,"The game is great offline.  I understand people are mad at the MyCareer and the multiplayer. If you just want to sit back, relax, and enjoy basketball, this is it.  If you wanted to play MyCareer but don't want to invest in a player, just play MyLeague and use ""player lock"". Create your character, customize however you like and enjoy.  Online play is non-existent. Don't even bother.  The increased difficulty in MyLeague make me want to come back to the game mode every single time I play. 2K have nerfed some parts of the stat system like a players potential. Someone who's A+ in potential may only shine if he has players who revolve around his play-style. Although, I find that you need a star in order to win a championship. Mediocre 80 overalls won't get you anywhere but the second round.  Virtual currency is very lenient this game. You can get an easy 1500 each game. They implemented a progression feature with the MyCareer character that allows you to progress through basketball. The progression blocks the player from increasing overalls. But, it allows the character to develop in a realistic fashion, although, very grindy. That's why I mentioned the MyLeague option.  If you enjoy basketball and offline play, it's something to look forward to when it's on sale. Looking for multiplayer? Stay clear from this title.  **Disclaimer: This is a straight copy of my review of 2K19. Nothing has changed.**"

You make about 5K vc every hour from playing my career games. You need about 250K to get your player to some proper overall. That's 50 hours of ""play"", unfortunately about 30% of playtime is loading screens and cutscenes.   And grinding badges is even worse.  You choose one player, you grind it for 200 hours. Wanna try another player? Well, good luck, that's another 200 hours.  The game is designed around the concept of having A TON of tedious tasks (mainly pressing A to skip). This is also present in MyGM. The players then pay to skip through the BS. That's the heart of the game basically.  Servers are still trash btw."
107253029,english,0,1089350,"Eventually, 2K will cease access to their servers, without warning, and without creating any proper offline modes to continue to play the full product you purchased at full price. This actually amounts to fraud and theft of product (which you purchased), and 2K has gotten away with this over a long time. Just because you ""agreed"" to a EULA, does NOT make this behavior legal on their part-and only a judge in court can actually make that decision. So, Save your money for the lawyer you should hire with other 2K purchasers and bring a class action suit against 2K."
55269394,english,0,1089350,"Horrible game. Most inconsistent launch of any triple A title video game I've ever seen... There has been so many game changing patches since the game came out, you really wonder if you're playing a demo or beta.   Examples: For some reason now there is a better chance of shooting an early shot and it going in, then shooting a slightly early just off the green window. No matter what 2K promises the servers will never be good, because if 2K can manage to save any money for in exchange for in game performance, you'll be safe to bet a billion dollars that they will surrender customer experience for MONEY. Shot contest is a joke. You can contest a shot / layup and be given 'good shot contest' only for the shot to go in.   Don't buy the game now. Wait until next year. The game will be much more polished ( hopefully ) and you will have a better experience compared to buying it right now.   In totality, 2K is so out of touch with their community and game. Simple bugs and glitches aren't even noticed by the dev team, but are noticed within the first 20 minutes of launch by the community. They released another un-finished product per usual."
64035026,english,0,1089350,"The game has significantly regressed since 2k18, AI defense is non-existent and the game is riddled with milestone barriers which require extensive grinding or pay to win microtransactions.   On top of that, 2k is a company going to way of EA in terms of business practice and ethics. The fact that this game has passed ESRB gambling bans despite being filled with roulette wheels, slot machines and card packs/loot boxes seems puzzling until you realise that the chair of the ESRB and the president of 2k is the same person.

Your character in MyCareer might as well not even try to take any shots or layups until you can upgrade them. I've literally watched shots that were perfect jump out of the hoop, breaking the games physics because it was determined by a number it wasnt good. Everything about this games design is made to make you spend extra money on a $60 or more purchase and with 2k21 even worse and costing $70 at base, 2k is probably more predatory and worse than EA at this point. NBA 2k used to be a great franchise but they are now neutering their game to push predatory microtransactions"

How can you expect a 65-70 overall to compete with NBA level talent? That's just criminal of 2k. Huge skill gap.

70878259,english,1,1089350,"[list] [h1]🔹Positive Aspects:[/h1] [*]Impressive visuals and face scans. [*]Huge variety in modes. [*]Soundtrack. [*]Best gameplay as far as basketball games go.  [h1]🔸Negative Aspects:[/h1] [*]Servers. [*]Major gameplay inconsistencies. [*]MyCareer is basically a grind game.   [h1]▶️Introduction[/h1] NBA 2K20 is the latest addition to the NBA 2K lineup which exists for almost 2 decades now. The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/2K]2K.[/url]  Release Date : 5th September 2019. Last known update: 29th May 2020.   [h1]🎮Gameplay:[/h1]  [b]Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?[/b]  [list] [*] [b]Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:[/b] Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasn’t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.  [*] [b]Gamemodes:[/b] [i][b]Play Now[/b][/i]: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include [b]Play WNBA[/b] that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, [b]NBA Today[/b] that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,[b]Play Now Online[/b] is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly [b]Blacktop[/b] which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to. [i][b]My Team[/b][/i]: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed. [i][b]My Career[/b][/i]: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and you’re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues. [i][b]My League[/b][/i]: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. [b]My GM[/b] Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.  [h1]🌇Graphics / Audio:[/h1] Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals. [list] [*] [b]Graphics:[/b]  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1865032563  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1859551512  [*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack:[/b] The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well. [/list]  [h1]🌀Performance:[/h1] [b][/b] [*] [b]In Game:[/b] AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S: I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the cap  Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500: Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.  [*] [b]🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b] The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues. [/list]  [h1]💲Price:[/h1] For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.  [h1]⚖️Conclusion:[/h1] NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.

If you are a fan of the last 4 2k games nothing in this one will surprise you, but you're likely to like this one as well.

64263070,english,0,1089350,"I don't often take time to review games on Steam, but this needs to be said. This game is a huge piece of garbage. I fully expected coming in that this would basically be a re-release of an old game with new rosters. That's just what these sports games are, yet people pluck them up for $60 every year.  I picked this up on sale for $20, so I was pretty tolerant of issues coming in. In short, this game is a [b]nearly unplayable buggy Gatorade/Beats/Express commercial[/b]. Hell, for all the in your face product placement (way more than you think) this may as well be free to play. This review sponsored by Gatorade GX, change the way you refuel. Beats.  Bugs: Here are just a few of the bugs you can expect to see: [list]   [*]Seemingly random crashes to desktop at any given moment. Especially fun after you've played 30+ minutes of your MyCareer game and you lose all your progress.   [*] If you set your refresh rate to anything higher than the 60hz default, then when you simulate to your next appearance in a MyCareer game, the game slows down to a crawl. It will not begin simulating until after about 1 minute of this and/or after you alt+tab a few times to ""kick start"" it.   [*] Online neighborhood games are often a lagfest, and there is a constant underlying latency added to your shot timing. Essentially you need to completely re-adjust how you shoot when playing online. This isn't game breaking, but it sure as hell is annoying. [/list]  Other comments:  In fairness to this game, when the MyCareer isn't crashing, it's actually quite fun. You can tell they expect you to grind to become a half decent player, and that feels a little more heavy handed than older versions I've played. This is likely a ploy to get you to spend your hard earned money on more VC so that you can actually compete, but to be honest it didn't take that much work for me to get to an 80 overall, and with smart play you can still be a competent player. Also, all of my experience has been in MyCareer mode. I've heard MyLeague/MyTeam are fun, and I can't personally attest to how stable those modes are. But know that if MyCareer is what you are after, you are probably going to be frustrated.  Honestly, for a game that does so little to innovate every year, you would think they would at least fix the bugs. However, they still sell every year without fixing anything so I won't hold my breath. I should note that when googling the random crash to desktop issue, I've found forum posts from NBA2K18 complaining about the same issue. Awesome.  Final Verdict: Don't buy this POS on Steam. The PC version isn't stable enough for an early access alpha let alone a ""AAA"" release. If you must play this game, I highly recommend you get it on console. I assume it actually functions there."
63411931,english,0,1089350,"I actually enjoy the game. I mainly play MyLeague. My problem is that the steam version constantly crashes during games without even an error message. I will play 47 minutes of a game and it will crash and I will end up simulating/replaying the game I just about finished. (very annoying) There are some other issues with the game as far as lacking design and features. (For example, you must select your favorite offensive plays at the start of each game. Those settings should persist between games in my opinion) They are not deal breakers, but the crashing bugs are not enough for me to choose the steam or pc versions over the Xbox/PlayStation versions. (Assuming those don't crash)"
54990744,english,0,1089350,"I sadly cannot recommend this game at this time.  The game makers should be embarrassed.  Steam should be embarrassed they sold this crap.  Right now, in its current state, the game is not at all playable.   The first thing you notice is it takes forever just to connect after you download.   When you get into the game, even on my 4K computer, it runs with latency.  At 4k resolution, the game will not let you run faster than 30 mhz refresh rate.  At 60 mhz and at about half resolution, the frame rate is terrible even on low settings.  The game videos do not play but instead give you a choppy green screen.  If you get passed all that and can get to MyPlayer and make a character, you'll find more issues.  The menus do not always work. Especially when simply trying to exit. Hit A. Nothing happens. You have to minimize and then close the application and restart.  So you're building a player. Sometimes it will let you choose what he looks like and sometimes it'll just send you straight to ability making.  After you choose your position, your ratings for various stats, etc, and you save your player, when you go to load it, you will something else. Like I made a Shooting Guard that can Slash to the basket. I ended up with a Small Forward with a different ability. I made a center playmaker and ended up with a Center paint defender.   With my center, I was shooting deep 3's and did not miss a single shot. On either player I created, I did not miss a shot. I did not play very many minutes, but still did not miss a shot in maybe a dozen or more attempts.   After all of this, I decided to ask for a refund, so unaware of what other problems there lies in other modes of the game or further along in a game or in MyStory mode beyond a few minutes. I am sure there are other issues.   This has been my experience with this product."
179766981,english,0,1089350,"I put 334 hours into this game playing MyCareer and a little bit of quickplay with friends during college. The MyCareer was amazing - you can pick from a list of nicknames so it feels pretty good. I remember thinking of how improvements to the game could be like, adding button/stick prompts to give interactive high-5s to build team chemistry, or being able to complain to refs, or shove someone, or pick up a tech. Instead, Ronnie 2k (the dude who makes these games) decided to lock me out of my 334 hour MyCareer playthrough to try and make me buy his new online product bloated with microtransactions. Shame.

Its pretty ridiculous that I bought this game for myself and my friend and I can't even play with him. It's downright disrespectful for the developers to not offer any assistance to get their faulty game to work. I can guarantee you that I'm never going to buy another 2k game if this is the kind of customer support they're touting.

54998483,english,0,1089350,"Wow.   So, let me just start off by saying, I really don't care at all for the MyCareer/MyTeam aspects of this (anymore) thanks to 2K monetizing it and making it grindy (not to mention the cringe-worthy storylines and dialog). My bread and butter is really MyGM mode. MyLeague would be my preferred option, except every 2K for the last several years has bare-boned MyLeague in favor of MyGM, leaving out crucial features like morale changes (I benched Russ the entire first half of this season to test for instance, and his morale didn't drop one bit in MyLeague), not to mention other features such as badges on staff and other aspects. So really, there is no ""perfect"" mode for me, thanks to how 2K has broken these modes apart.   Anyway, so the last several years I've been playing MyGM, because with all its flaws, it's still at the best experience available (unfortunately). 2K19's MyGM was actually fairly decent, it gave us most of the options available in MyLeague, while still retaining its own feel. It was fine. Apparently that wasn't going to fly with 2K.  So fast-forward to 2K20. MyGM has been bastardized and is TOTAL GARBAGE. Gone is the ability to edit your players -- AT ALL. Want to change Ben Simmons from a PG to a SF? Can't do it. Want to make AD a PF instead of Center since LA already has Boogie and Dwight at Center? Nope, not anymore.  The entire ""edit player"" option is gone in MyGM. You can no longer edit a player's number (so now if a goofy new player comes to OKC and takes #0, well, even though it's unrealistic, you're stuck with it). You can no longer designate a player as a playmaker in the edit settings. You can no longer edit their accessories. You can no longer do ANYTHING we could previously do in those settings in other iterations -- it's totally gone. I get removing the ability to edit other teams players, admittedly there were ways to really cheese the system last year, such as changing other teams' players that you wanted to crazy positions (like Andre Drummond as a PG) in order to make them tradeable, so if they had removed the ability to edit other teams' players, I would be ok with that. But you are telling me as a GM, I can't change the positions of my own players to evolve with my team? What?!   On top of that, you can no longer use a custom roster anymore. Honestly, I wouldn't care much about this personally, the only reason I use it is because 2K still lists KD as 6'9, despite the fact he is clearly not and has admitted so himself, so it looks goofy seeing him next to Giannis who is 2"" taller than him in the game, even though they are the same height in real life.    Also, another HUGE missing feature, is that I can no longer set the quarter length, or sim the games I play to have realistic minutes and stats, so now everything is off if I decide to play my own games (which if you don't, what is even the point of playing?). Why was this removed? It makes no damn sense. We can no longer make any other difficulty edits, other than a generic (and totally vague and unhelpful) option to select an easy, medium, or hard difficulty at the beginning, and that's it.    And don't even get me started on the new ""action point"" system. I still don't understand it, and it still makes no sense, but I can already tell it's awful. Apparently, you have to do something every single day if you want to be able to even play a game -- I can't even just fucking select a game to play on the calendar anymore, it won't let me. I have to do BS tasks and other things each day just to advance. The NBA season is long! I don't want to literally do hundreds of things that are mostly meaningless every season just to be able to play games I want to play.    There's a lot of other things I am forgetting in the heat of the moment, and I may come back and edit this as I remember/discover more.   But the main takeaway is that this game has been severely stripped down from the MyGM aspect, to the point that it is pretty much unplayable. Again, none of this would be an issue if MyLeague were given the same basic features and systems that MyGM has, such as working player morale, coaching badges, a feeling that players actually care what you do, etc, but that has been neglected for years by 2K. I suspect it's because they want people playing only modes which include options to spend VC, and if you can customize the game mode to make the league how you want it, how are they going to get money out of you?   This game is really gross. I'm going to give MyGM a while longer, but I may legit ask for a refund. I keep asking myself ""why"" throughout my experience with this game. MyGM was fixed and fine last year, WHY did they strip it down and make it so restrictive? Restrictive and prohibitive is the best way to describe it.   I won't be buying 2K next year. I'll wait until a decent version is cracked, and then just grab it that way. I don't care for any of the online BS because it's already been turned into a grindfest in order to milk money out of people for a game they already paid for, so in my eyes 2K did this to themselves. What a gross and disgusting company.   Stay away from this game.    Also, as I saw a few other people mention, this is literally such a copy-paste of 2K19, that as of this moment, the icon in the task bar when it's running still shows the 2K19 version. LMAO"
71005835,english,0,1089350,"This game sucks.  I only bought it because I like career mode and this years NBA roster is the most competitive it has been in a long time. Like almost 90% of the other reviews this is a legit copy of 2k19. The only difference is the new way to build your characters which granted is cool and works well. Everything else sucks. The AI is one of the worst things I have ever seen in a video game. You can have Anthony Davis who is 97 in my career mode and he goes like 1-10 in the paint against Trae young. That's not even a joke. The AI almost never posts up or do any good moves, if you pass them the ball in the paint they will take the ugliest most contested shot right away with like 15 seconds left on the shot clock. This would be fine if they were like 80 overall but we are talking about the Player that's on the cover of your game. They refuse to add more features and or fix anything. I understand that career mode is not as profitable but this company make an insane amount of cash on this game and as consumers we deserve a better product.  Dont buy this game if already own a 2K game made in the last 5 years. You're wasting your money and you only give them the power to continue to improve nothing about their games. Idiots like myself and other ""loyal"" fans are the reason these games never improve. This is the last 2k game I buy until they actually improve any aspect of gameplay."
55041396,english,0,1089350,"So first off, I'm a fool for buying the game this year. No way around it.   Now lets get to the game itself.  From my 7-8 hours of gameplay, i still see the same issues that the last few editions had. Let's name a few.   Disliked the archetype system? Well this year that's changed, into the exact same thing without the names. There's literally no difference, except instead of sharpshooter/slasher/defender/etc, you now have pie charts that does the exact same thing. Want a Melo clone? Well fuck you, have a watered down version that either doesn't know how to finish at the rim, shoot 3's, post up or have a ball handling stat that will enable you to go by terrible defenders. Chose 2, and forget all about defence.  Wanna make a fucking Terrence Ross? Well pick between Dunks, 3pt and finishing at the rim. You can't have all 3.   Wanna double team? You'll get minus point for leaving your assignment. Doesn't matter if you get a steal and win the game because of it. You left a person open, so the game will fault you for it.   Got less than 70 in block rating? Your character will jump AWAY from the ball. I've played and trained basketball for tiny people. Even the 8 year olds know to jump TOWARDS the ball.   Dislike cutscenes? Well bohoo. This game will force you to watch them.   Liked last years choices when it came to MyGM? well fuck you, this year you only get the storied version that nobody liked in 2k19.  I could go on and on and on and on and .... But seriously, we all knew this was gonna be the game. 1 step forward 1 step back. Of course if you expect any focus on online play and hackers, well you're as big an idiot as i was.   I realise my next words are gonna sound cliché, but I won't be buying 2k games for a few years.  I shouldn't have bought it this year, but i somehow fell for their marketing tricks and decided to give them 1 last chance. And holy fuck do i regret doing so.   This is a trash game made by a trash developer, produced by a trash production team.   It's trash.  1st Edit: So i've played a bit more, and i've encountered so many other issues, that i think i need to keep going with this. Bear in mind that these are all bugs that were in previous years editions too.  If you pass and the ball even scratches a player on the opposite team, it's about 50-50 if it'll count as a turnover or not. Doesn't matter if they actually had control over the ball or not.   I'm currently an 80 overall, despite not having a single attribute above 70, and alot of my attributes being below 50. So this year we're able to play as the most overrated NBA star to ever grace the earth. Thanks 2K, you sure know how to give people what they want.   Demarcus Cousins. So his injury apparently affected his shooting mostly, since he's now in the mid 60's on open 3 pointers, and high 50's on open midrange shots. Of course we all know lower body injuries fuck with your hands.  But in that case they must have changed his tendencies too right? Nope. Every time i pass to him, he takes the jumper and of course misses. He might honestly be the worst player in the game right now, considering his stats vs tendencies.   Teammates don't run their lanes or roll towards the basket. The amount of times a teammate will move to my exact position instead of rolling to an open basket is like 99% of the time.   I'm using a Dualshock 4 Controller, and despite it being fully supported on the PS4, it's still not fully supported on PC. The game tells me to pass by pressing ""A"" despite my controller not having any ""A's""."

60434533,english,0,1089350,"Due to the reviews, I wasn't expected much. But I gotta admit, I have played this game (mostly MyCareer) a lot and enjoyed it more it than I expected. Despite that, there are some glaring issues that need to be fixed.  These are just some I can come up of the top of my head: - Whenever you set the refresh rate above 60Hz (for example 144Hz, or in my case, 240Hz), it causes a game-breaking bug where, in MyCareer, you cannot skip part of the gameplay (simulate the game until next appearance) when you get subbed out. You have to basically have to sit and watch your A.I teammates play for 5-6 minutes every game. There are some workarounds, set the refresh rate back to 60Hz (which kinda suck cause I bought this game to pay in high refresh rate) or ALT-TAB several times until you can sub in.  - This game constantly crashes on my PC. I tried everything, re-installing the GPU driver, re-installing game, checked for missing game files, change in-game setting, updating windows, nothing works. My PC Spec is far above the recommended requirements (3900x + 2080ti).  - The game is basically the same as 2k19, same engine, same graphics, just a little upgrade on the User Interfaces.  - You can basically pay-to-win on this game. It is filled to the brim with micro-transactions.  - You cannot access MyPlayerNation, 2KLeague and Ruffles rewards on PC Versions (Unlike the ones on consoles)  In conclusion, NBA2K19 V2 is not worth 80 CAD. Don't buy it (unless it's at least 95% off). You can get a lot of burritos for $80"

This game at its core has not changed much since 2K16. This port for PC is really awful. If you're trying to play online then you are just wasting your time, between the input lag, the net code, and the 2K servers, the online play is dreadful. One of the biggest reason why I quit playing NBA 2K was because the servers were not good. They have not been good the past few years and this year was the worst I have experienced by far. I have watched countless hours of YouTuber's who play this game and it looks bad for them too, I will say that online play seems to run a little smoother on PS4 and Xbox but I am only saying that cause of the  YouTube videos I have seen. I don't know why the online connections on PC are so bad but it is unplayable. Outside of the 2K servers, the other reason I will never buy another NBA 2K game again unless changes are made, is because of all the microtransactions. All 2K cares about is money. Everything you do in this game involves money. I personally have only played MyTeam mode. I read to many horror stories about the other online game modes, so I stuck with MyTeam only.   This mode could be a lot better. If you are a player that chooses not to pay money, then you are in for one long grind. The sad part about the grind is, outside of the GOAT Galaxy Opal Kobe card, the rewards you get are not really worth grinding for. As mentioned previously, I can never connect to matches and if I do, it is a lag fest the whole time. You will also notice as a non-paying player that you will be at an extreme disadvantage against paying players. No matter your skill level, if someone has a stacked team, 9 times out of 10 they will beat you, and there is not a whole lot that can be done about it, and it is all because they bought it and it is another ploy from 2K to try and get you to spend money. I will admit that I have a good paying job, so it sadly affords me the opportunity to indulge myself on needless expenses, such as buying VC for packs. Be that as it may, getting such a late start to MyTeam, kind of forces you to pay if I want to get good players in a limited time. To those that wonder if paying money for VC to buy packs is worth it, I will tell you it is not. That is another reason why I feel cheated with this NBA 2K game. Even when you decide to spend money on the game, the pack odds are terrible. The chances of pulling the same duplicate cards seems to be a lot higher than need to be and at the end of the day, if you do pull a Galaxy Opal, chances are it is going to be the worst one. The amount of money that I have spent in the little I have played this game is not worth the rewards that you get. The offline modes would be better, but as I have seen in several reviews, the input lag on PC is bad. The players go out of their way to do the weirdest moves on the simplest of commands. Unless I am wide open and not moving, almost every shot has a delay, and it is multiplied by a 1000 when playing online.   If you read this far, then you've probable guessed that I am just writing this review because I am annoyed at spending money and not getting the best players. That may have been very annoying for me, I just wanted to tell you the truth from someone who isn't paid to write nice things about this game, my assessment is true. I am not a YouTuber, and I am not a Streamer, I am just that regular everyday person who really wanted this game to be good, and  it just isn't which is sad. I promise I don't regret spending the money on the packs, my annoyance with that is that the pack odds seems to favor 2K and again- their idea of making money off people. Plain and simple please stop buying 2K games and spending your money on this company. At the end of the day this company cares about one thing, and that is themselves. They make billions of dollars from players every year, and every year this game does not improve, mainly their servers, what could be the best aspect of this game, playing online with your buddy from across the country, turns into an unplayable lag fest. Never invest your time or money into a company that is littered with microtransactions and allows people to be pay to win. I just wish NBA Live would return and be somewhat decent, that may give 2K a reason to go back and do better and realize what use to make this game fun in the first place. Do Not Buy."

If you would just show the PC version the same attention as console the game could be playable.  2k has been and always will be all about the money and not about the fucking people that are about playing the game for fun and its ridiculous.

Unless you buy Virtual Currency in the game you get destroyed. Game is built to bleed real life money from online players instead of offering a pleasurable experience to a single player campaign or story line.  I left a bad review for 2k19 and no one listened, this game is exactly the same, why would I pay for the exact same game. Im so disappointed I don't ever want to play NBA 2k again and i'm a life long fan since 2000. Make a game that delivers enjoyment not monetization. THIS IS NOT A MOBILE APP STOP TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF PEOPLE AFTER A RETAIL PURCHASE.  I've refunded my purchase of the legendary edition. Will not buy 2k20 until the 1-10 dollar sale day in a year.

66037976,english,0,1089350,"If you're a MyCareer player, like me, expect to be sorely disappointed by the quality of this game.  The CPU players routinely make inexplicable decisions, especially on defense, and you will often find your team perfectly set defensively, only for one of your teammates to suddenly leave a 3-point shooter wide open because he wants to switch the match-up. This has been a problem since NBA 2k17, and I don't think it will change for a very long time. While I appreciated NBA 2k19 for the quality of the collisions, NBA 2k20 has gone backwards massively, and you will often see players going through each other. For example, you will see a defender's hand go through the ball as he's trying to block a shot (without a block registering), or you might find yourself in perfect position to defend, only for the ball handler to go through you and find himself wide open in front of the basket. The way in which the game plays is extremely unrealistic. All teams play exactly the same offensively, i.e. the ball handler gets the ball, he triggers some useless offensive motion, then sits around while the shot clock counts down and then shoots a contested jumper. Defensively there are only minor differences related to how they treat pick and rolls and mismatches. Hall of fame difficulty, just like previous years, turns your teammates into secondary school calibre players, unable to make even the simplest plays, like pass to a wide open teammate, knock down open jumpers (which especially applies to top tier shooters), and sometimes refuse to shoot an open layup in front of the basket, instead preferring to make 2-3 useless pump fakes, during which the defender gets back into position, and then air-ball a contested layup. Conversely, the Hall of Fame CPU is moved into a Godlike tier. Do not be mistaken, this does not mean they are smarter, or more skilled. They still trigger useless offense, and run around with no purpose, however, they just make impossible plays. There is the classic example of the heavily contested three as the shot clock winds down, but even if that misses, you will find that the HOF CPU will dominate the boards, and will have a 99% chance of boxing out the defending rebounder. This applies regardless of who is fighting for the rebound, so a player like Jayson Tatum will somehow manage to push Andre Drummond out of the way and grab an improbable rebound, then dunk the ball like Shaq. Instead of making the experience of playing on Hall of Fame fun and challenging, they just made it purely frustrating and unrealistic and I do not recommend anyone to buy this game, unless they wish to try other modes."

Had an error during a Trivia event, sent in a ticket and they basically told me ""Too bad, you will have to wait until the next Trivia to try again"". Didn't buy 2K19, thought this was going to be different but made that mistake. Also to add to the love for 2K, these morons advertised ""MyPlayer Nation"", a MyCareer add-on at the start of the NBA season and guess what? PC players can kindly take a middle finger.

If you wanted to play MyCareer but don't want to invest in a player, just play MyLeague and use ""player lock"". Create your character, customize however you like and enjoy.  Online play is non-existent. Don't even bother.  The increased difficulty in MyLeague make me want to come back to the game mode every single time I play. 2K have nerfed some parts of the stat system like a players potential. Someone who's A+ in potential may only shine if he has players who revolve around his play-style. Although, I find that you need a star in order to win a championship. Mediocre 80 overalls won't get you anywhere but the second round.  Virtual currency is very lenient this game. You can get an easy 1500 each game. They implemented a progression feature with the MyCareer character that allows you to progress through basketball. The progression blocks the player from increasing overalls. But, it allows the character to develop in a realistic fashion, although, very grindy. That's why I mentioned the MyLeague option.  If you enjoy basketball and offline play, it's something to look forward to when it's on sale. Looking for multiplayer?

No matter what 2K promises the servers will never be good, because if 2K can manage to save any money for in exchange for in game performance, you'll be safe to bet a billion dollars that they will surrender customer experience for MONEY. Shot contest is a joke. You can contest a shot / layup and be given 'good shot contest' only for the shot to go in.   Don't buy the game now. Wait until next year. The game will be much more polished ( hopefully ) and you will have a better experience compared to buying it right now.   In totality, 2K is so out of touch with their community and game.

The fact that this game has passed ESRB gambling bans despite being filled with roulette wheels, slot machines and card packs/loot boxes seems puzzling until you realise that the chair of the ESRB and the president of 2k is the same person.

I've literally watched shots that were perfect jump out of the hoop, breaking the games physics because it was determined by a number it wasnt good. Everything about this games design is made to make you spend extra money on a $60 or more purchase and with 2k21 even worse and costing $70 at base, 2k is probably more predatory and worse than EA at this point.

[h1]▶️Introduction[/h1] NBA 2K20 is the latest addition to the NBA 2K lineup which exists for almost 2 decades now. The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/2K]2K.[/url]  Release Date : 5th September 2019. Last known update: 29th May 2020.   [h1]🎮Gameplay:[/h1]  [b]Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?[/b]  [list] [*] [b]Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:[/b] Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasn’t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.  [*] [b]Gamemodes:[/b] [i][b]Play Now[/b][/i]: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include [b]Play WNBA[/b] that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, [b]NBA Today[/b] that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,[b]Play Now Online[/b] is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly [b]Blacktop[/b] which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to. [i][b]My Team[/b][/i]: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed. [i][b]My Career[/b][/i]: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and you’re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues. [i][b]My League[/b][/i]: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. [b]My GM[/b] Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.  [h1]🌇Graphics / Audio:[/h1] Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals.

Note:60fps is the cap  Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500: Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.  [*] [b]🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b] The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues. [/list]  [h1]💲Price:[/h1] For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.  [h1]⚖️Conclusion:[/h1] NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.

58646642,english,1,1089350,"90% of what I play in this game is single player. I have read reviews about the multiplayer being filled with bugs and I can't speak to that. I also only paid $30 for it which I feel is fair. You know what you get with NBA2k: an unethical $60 price tag for a game that should be free to play with all the microtransactions. If you are a fan of the last 4 2k games nothing in this one will surprise you, but you're likely to like this one as well. Same game as the last one, same microtransactions as the last one, still fun for an NBA fan imo. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME."

I have wasted countless hours and dollars on this game just to get it to work with no avail. I have tried looking for a fix for this but have found zero solutions that have worked.

The server shutdown makes effectively all of the game modes inaccessible, including single-player modes. I purchased this game months before the release of 2K21, so it was still the latest version to have been released at that time. And I had about one and half years before single-player modes are not longer accessible. I would warn all others to not purchase any 2K products, at least until such extreme practices are addressed."

64263070,english,0,1089350,"I don't often take time to review games on Steam, but this needs to be said. This game is a huge piece of garbage. I fully expected coming in that this would basically be a re-release of an old game with new rosters. That's just what these sports games are, yet people pluck them up for $60 every year.  I picked this up on sale for $20, so I was pretty tolerant of issues coming in. In short, this game is a [b]nearly unplayable buggy Gatorade/Beats/Express commercial[/b]. Hell, for all the in your face product placement (way more than you think) this may as well be free to play. This review sponsored by Gatorade GX, change the way you refuel. Beats.  Bugs: Here are just a few of the bugs you can expect to see: [list]   [*]Seemingly random crashes to desktop at any given moment. Especially fun after you've played 30+ minutes of your MyCareer game and you lose all your progress.   [*] If you set your refresh rate to anything higher than the 60hz default, then when you simulate to your next appearance in a MyCareer game, the game slows down to a crawl. It will not begin simulating until after about 1 minute of this and/or after you alt+tab a few times to ""kick start"" it.   [*] Online neighborhood games are often a lagfest, and there is a constant underlying latency added to your shot timing. Essentially you need to completely re-adjust how you shoot when playing online. This isn't game breaking, but it sure as hell is annoying. [/list]  Other comments:  In fairness to this game, when the MyCareer isn't crashing, it's actually quite fun. You can tell they expect you to grind to become a half decent player, and that feels a little more heavy handed than older versions I've played. This is likely a ploy to get you to spend your hard earned money on more VC so that you can actually compete, but to be honest it didn't take that much work for me to get to an 80 overall, and with smart play you can still be a competent player. Also, all of my experience has been in MyCareer mode. I've heard MyLeague/MyTeam are fun, and I can't personally attest to how stable those modes are. But know that if MyCareer is what you are after, you are probably going to be frustrated.  Honestly, for a game that does so little to innovate every year, you would think they would at least fix the bugs. However, they still sell every year without fixing anything so I won't hold my breath. I should note that when googling the random crash to desktop issue, I've found forum posts from NBA2K18 complaining about the same issue. Awesome.  Final Verdict: Don't buy this POS on Steam. The PC version isn't stable enough for an early access alpha let alone a ""AAA"" release. If you must play this game, I highly recommend you get it on console. I assume it actually functions there."
63411931,english,0,1089350,"I actually enjoy the game. I mainly play MyLeague. My problem is that the steam version constantly crashes during games without even an error message. I will play 47 minutes of a game and it will crash and I will end up simulating/replaying the game I just about finished. (very annoying) There are some other issues with the game as far as lacking design and features. (For example, you must select your favorite offensive plays at the start of each game. Those settings should persist between games in my opinion) They are not deal breakers, but the crashing bugs are not enough for me to choose the steam or pc versions over the Xbox/PlayStation versions. (Assuming those don't crash)"
54990744,english,0,1089350,"I sadly cannot recommend this game at this time.  The game makers should be embarrassed.  Steam should be embarrassed they sold this crap.  Right now, in its current state, the game is not at all playable.   The first thing you notice is it takes forever just to connect after you download.   When you get into the game, even on my 4K computer, it runs with latency.  At 4k resolution, the game will not let you run faster than 30 mhz refresh rate.  At 60 mhz and at about half resolution, the frame rate is terrible even on low settings.  The game videos do not play but instead give you a choppy green screen.  If you get passed all that and can get to MyPlayer and make a character, you'll find more issues.  The menus do not always work. Especially when simply trying to exit. Hit A. Nothing happens. You have to minimize and then close the application and restart.  So you're building a player. Sometimes it will let you choose what he looks like and sometimes it'll just send you straight to ability making.  After you choose your position, your ratings for various stats, etc, and you save your player, when you go to load it, you will something else. Like I made a Shooting Guard that can Slash to the basket. I ended up with a Small Forward with a different ability. I made a center playmaker and ended up with a Center paint defender.   With my center, I was shooting deep 3's and did not miss a single shot. On either player I created, I did not miss a shot. I did not play very many minutes, but still did not miss a shot in maybe a dozen or more attempts.   After all of this, I decided to ask for a refund, so unaware of what other problems there lies in other modes of the game or further along in a game or in MyStory mode beyond a few minutes. I am sure there are other issues.   This has been my experience with this product."
179766981,english,0,1089350,"I put 334 hours into this game playing MyCareer and a little bit of quickplay with friends during college. The MyCareer was amazing - you can pick from a list of nicknames so it feels pretty good. I remember thinking of how improvements to the game could be like, adding button/stick prompts to give interactive high-5s to build team chemistry, or being able to complain to refs, or shove someone, or pick up a tech. Instead, Ronnie 2k (the dude who makes these games) decided to lock me out of my 334 hour MyCareer playthrough to try and make me buy his new online product bloated with microtransactions. Shame.

I shouldn't have to grind copious amounts of time just to get the badge to HOF which is the only badge level that shoots relatively reasonable (still way too slow). Ronnie2k should be fired, I should be able to get my money back but because I was a dummy I played more than what I should of.

I don't play MyTeam so I wouldn't know what to say about that because I'm not paying one cent to any company that will turn into gambling.

Its pretty ridiculous that I bought this game for myself and my friend and I can't even play with him. It's downright disrespectful for the developers to not offer any assistance to get their faulty game to work. I can guarantee you that I'm never going to buy another 2k game if this is the kind of customer support they're touting. It's disgusting that I spent more than 100 dollars on this game and I can't even play it. If you're thinking of purchasing this game or any other 2k game for that matter, don't. This publisher is going to keep spitting in the faces of their customers if you keep purchasing their subpar product. They won't bother offering any assistance until they get hit where it hurts.

54998483,english,0,1089350,"Wow.   So, let me just start off by saying, I really don't care at all for the MyCareer/MyTeam aspects of this (anymore) thanks to 2K monetizing it and making it grindy (not to mention the cringe-worthy storylines and dialog). My bread and butter is really MyGM mode. MyLeague would be my preferred option, except every 2K for the last several years has bare-boned MyLeague in favor of MyGM, leaving out crucial features like morale changes (I benched Russ the entire first half of this season to test for instance, and his morale didn't drop one bit in MyLeague), not to mention other features such as badges on staff and other aspects. So really, there is no ""perfect"" mode for me, thanks to how 2K has broken these modes apart.   Anyway, so the last several years I've been playing MyGM, because with all its flaws, it's still at the best experience available (unfortunately). 2K19's MyGM was actually fairly decent, it gave us most of the options available in MyLeague, while still retaining its own feel. It was fine. Apparently that wasn't going to fly with 2K.  So fast-forward to 2K20. MyGM has been bastardized and is TOTAL GARBAGE. Gone is the ability to edit your players -- AT ALL. Want to change Ben Simmons from a PG to a SF? Can't do it. Want to make AD a PF instead of Center since LA already has Boogie and Dwight at Center? Nope, not anymore.  The entire ""edit player"" option is gone in MyGM. You can no longer edit a player's number (so now if a goofy new player comes to OKC and takes #0, well, even though it's unrealistic, you're stuck with it). You can no longer designate a player as a playmaker in the edit settings. You can no longer edit their accessories. You can no longer do ANYTHING we could previously do in those settings in other iterations -- it's totally gone. I get removing the ability to edit other teams players, admittedly there were ways to really cheese the system last year, such as changing other teams' players that you wanted to crazy positions (like Andre Drummond as a PG) in order to make them tradeable, so if they had removed the ability to edit other teams' players, I would be ok with that. But you are telling me as a GM, I can't change the positions of my own players to evolve with my team? What?!   On top of that, you can no longer use a custom roster anymore. Honestly, I wouldn't care much about this personally, the only reason I use it is because 2K still lists KD as 6'9, despite the fact he is clearly not and has admitted so himself, so it looks goofy seeing him next to Giannis who is 2"" taller than him in the game, even though they are the same height in real life.    Also, another HUGE missing feature, is that I can no longer set the quarter length, or sim the games I play to have realistic minutes and stats, so now everything is off if I decide to play my own games (which if you don't, what is even the point of playing?). Why was this removed? It makes no damn sense. We can no longer make any other difficulty edits, other than a generic (and totally vague and unhelpful) option to select an easy, medium, or hard difficulty at the beginning, and that's it.    And don't even get me started on the new ""action point"" system. I still don't understand it, and it still makes no sense, but I can already tell it's awful. Apparently, you have to do something every single day if you want to be able to even play a game -- I can't even just fucking select a game to play on the calendar anymore, it won't let me. I have to do BS tasks and other things each day just to advance. The NBA season is long! I don't want to literally do hundreds of things that are mostly meaningless every season just to be able to play games I want to play.    There's a lot of other things I am forgetting in the heat of the moment, and I may come back and edit this as I remember/discover more.   But the main takeaway is that this game has been severely stripped down from the MyGM aspect, to the point that it is pretty much unplayable. Again, none of this would be an issue if MyLeague were given the same basic features and systems that MyGM has, such as working player morale, coaching badges, a feeling that players actually care what you do, etc, but that has been neglected for years by 2K. I suspect it's because they want people playing only modes which include options to spend VC, and if you can customize the game mode to make the league how you want it, how are they going to get money out of you?   This game is really gross. I'm going to give MyGM a while longer, but I may legit ask for a refund. I keep asking myself ""why"" throughout my experience with this game. MyGM was fixed and fine last year, WHY did they strip it down and make it so restrictive? Restrictive and prohibitive is the best way to describe it.   I won't be buying 2K next year. I'll wait until a decent version is cracked, and then just grab it that way. I don't care for any of the online BS because it's already been turned into a grindfest in order to milk money out of people for a game they already paid for, so in my eyes 2K did this to themselves. What a gross and disgusting company.   Stay away from this game.    Also, as I saw a few other people mention, this is literally such a copy-paste of 2K19, that as of this moment, the icon in the task bar when it's running still shows the 2K19 version. LMAO"
71005835,english,0,1089350,"This game sucks.  I only bought it because I like career mode and this years NBA roster is the most competitive it has been in a long time. Like almost 90% of the other reviews this is a legit copy of 2k19. The only difference is the new way to build your characters which granted is cool and works well. Everything else sucks. The AI is one of the worst things I have ever seen in a video game. You can have Anthony Davis who is 97 in my career mode and he goes like 1-10 in the paint against Trae young. That's not even a joke. The AI almost never posts up or do any good moves, if you pass them the ball in the paint they will take the ugliest most contested shot right away with like 15 seconds left on the shot clock. This would be fine if they were like 80 overall but we are talking about the Player that's on the cover of your game. They refuse to add more features and or fix anything. I understand that career mode is not as profitable but this company make an insane amount of cash on this game and as consumers we deserve a better product.  Dont buy this game if already own a 2K game made in the last 5 years. You're wasting your money and you only give them the power to continue to improve nothing about their games. Idiots like myself and other ""loyal"" fans are the reason these games never improve. This is the last 2k game I buy until they actually improve any aspect of gameplay."
55041396,english,0,1089350,"So first off, I'm a fool for buying the game this year. No way around it.   Now lets get to the game itself.  From my 7-8 hours of gameplay, i still see the same issues that the last few editions had. Let's name a few.   Disliked the archetype system? Well this year that's changed, into the exact same thing without the names. There's literally no difference, except instead of sharpshooter/slasher/defender/etc, you now have pie charts that does the exact same thing. Want a Melo clone? Well fuck you, have a watered down version that either doesn't know how to finish at the rim, shoot 3's, post up or have a ball handling stat that will enable you to go by terrible defenders. Chose 2, and forget all about defence.  Wanna make a fucking Terrence Ross? Well pick between Dunks, 3pt and finishing at the rim. You can't have all 3.   Wanna double team? You'll get minus point for leaving your assignment. Doesn't matter if you get a steal and win the game because of it. You left a person open, so the game will fault you for it.   Got less than 70 in block rating? Your character will jump AWAY from the ball. I've played and trained basketball for tiny people. Even the 8 year olds know to jump TOWARDS the ball.   Dislike cutscenes? Well bohoo. This game will force you to watch them.   Liked last years choices when it came to MyGM? well fuck you, this year you only get the storied version that nobody liked in 2k19.  I could go on and on and on and on and .... But seriously, we all knew this was gonna be the game. 1 step forward 1 step back. Of course if you expect any focus on online play and hackers, well you're as big an idiot as i was.   I realise my next words are gonna sound cliché, but I won't be buying 2k games for a few years.  I shouldn't have bought it this year, but i somehow fell for their marketing tricks and decided to give them 1 last chance. And holy fuck do i regret doing so.   This is a trash game made by a trash developer, produced by a trash production team.   It's trash.  1st Edit: So i've played a bit more, and i've encountered so many other issues, that i think i need to keep going with this. Bear in mind that these are all bugs that were in previous years editions too.  If you pass and the ball even scratches a player on the opposite team, it's about 50-50 if it'll count as a turnover or not. Doesn't matter if they actually had control over the ball or not.   I'm currently an 80 overall, despite not having a single attribute above 70, and alot of my attributes being below 50. So this year we're able to play as the most overrated NBA star to ever grace the earth. Thanks 2K, you sure know how to give people what they want.   Demarcus Cousins. So his injury apparently affected his shooting mostly, since he's now in the mid 60's on open 3 pointers, and high 50's on open midrange shots. Of course we all know lower body injuries fuck with your hands.  But in that case they must have changed his tendencies too right? Nope. Every time i pass to him, he takes the jumper and of course misses. He might honestly be the worst player in the game right now, considering his stats vs tendencies.   Teammates don't run their lanes or roll towards the basket. The amount of times a teammate will move to my exact position instead of rolling to an open basket is like 99% of the time.   I'm using a Dualshock 4 Controller, and despite it being fully supported on the PS4, it's still not fully supported on PC. The game tells me to pass by pressing ""A"" despite my controller not having any ""A's""."

60434533,english,0,1089350,"Due to the reviews, I wasn't expected much. But I gotta admit, I have played this game (mostly MyCareer) a lot and enjoyed it more it than I expected. Despite that, there are some glaring issues that need to be fixed.  These are just some I can come up of the top of my head: - Whenever you set the refresh rate above 60Hz (for example 144Hz, or in my case, 240Hz), it causes a game-breaking bug where, in MyCareer, you cannot skip part of the gameplay (simulate the game until next appearance) when you get subbed out. You have to basically have to sit and watch your A.I teammates play for 5-6 minutes every game. There are some workarounds, set the refresh rate back to 60Hz (which kinda suck cause I bought this game to pay in high refresh rate) or ALT-TAB several times until you can sub in.  - This game constantly crashes on my PC. I tried everything, re-installing the GPU driver, re-installing game, checked for missing game files, change in-game setting, updating windows, nothing works. My PC Spec is far above the recommended requirements (3900x + 2080ti).  - The game is basically the same as 2k19, same engine, same graphics, just a little upgrade on the User Interfaces.  - You can basically pay-to-win on this game. It is filled to the brim with micro-transactions.  - You cannot access MyPlayerNation, 2KLeague and Ruffles rewards on PC Versions (Unlike the ones on consoles)  In conclusion, NBA2K19 V2 is not worth 80 CAD. Don't buy it (unless it's at least 95% off). You can get a lot of burritos for $80"
84029737,english,0,1089350,I only play this game because I love basketball. 2k is one of the worst companies in the entire world. Next gen isnt even coming to PC even tho it was programmed on a damn pc. Its pathetic. Only buy a 2k game when its 80% off or more. Do not support 2k and their piece of shit bosses
71296009,english,0,1089350,"Here is my honest assessment of the 2K series and this game. I read most of the bad reviews and I read most of the good reviews prior to buying this game. I have not owned or played NBA 2K since 2K16. So I decided to buy this game when it was on sale. I can honestly say that I will never buy another NBA 2K game ever again without some serious changes. This game at its core has not changed much since 2K16. This port for PC is really awful. If you're trying to play online then you are just wasting your time, between the input lag, the net code, and the 2K servers, the online play is dreadful. One of the biggest reason why I quit playing NBA 2K was because the servers were not good. They have not been good the past few years and this year was the worst I have experienced by far. I have watched countless hours of YouTuber's who play this game and it looks bad for them too, I will say that online play seems to run a little smoother on PS4 and Xbox but I am only saying that cause of the  YouTube videos I have seen. I don't know why the online connections on PC are so bad but it is unplayable. Outside of the 2K servers, the other reason I will never buy another NBA 2K game again unless changes are made, is because of all the microtransactions. All 2K cares about is money. Everything you do in this game involves money. I personally have only played MyTeam mode. I read to many horror stories about the other online game modes, so I stuck with MyTeam only.   This mode could be a lot better. If you are a player that chooses not to pay money, then you are in for one long grind. The sad part about the grind is, outside of the GOAT Galaxy Opal Kobe card, the rewards you get are not really worth grinding for. As mentioned previously, I can never connect to matches and if I do, it is a lag fest the whole time. You will also notice as a non-paying player that you will be at an extreme disadvantage against paying players. No matter your skill level, if someone has a stacked team, 9 times out of 10 they will beat you, and there is not a whole lot that can be done about it, and it is all because they bought it and it is another ploy from 2K to try and get you to spend money. I will admit that I have a good paying job, so it sadly affords me the opportunity to indulge myself on needless expenses, such as buying VC for packs. Be that as it may, getting such a late start to MyTeam, kind of forces you to pay if I want to get good players in a limited time. To those that wonder if paying money for VC to buy packs is worth it, I will tell you it is not. That is another reason why I feel cheated with this NBA 2K game. Even when you decide to spend money on the game, the pack odds are terrible. The chances of pulling the same duplicate cards seems to be a lot higher than need to be and at the end of the day, if you do pull a Galaxy Opal, chances are it is going to be the worst one. The amount of money that I have spent in the little I have played this game is not worth the rewards that you get. The offline modes would be better, but as I have seen in several reviews, the input lag on PC is bad. The players go out of their way to do the weirdest moves on the simplest of commands. Unless I am wide open and not moving, almost every shot has a delay, and it is multiplied by a 1000 when playing online.   If you read this far, then you've probable guessed that I am just writing this review because I am annoyed at spending money and not getting the best players. That may have been very annoying for me, I just wanted to tell you the truth from someone who isn't paid to write nice things about this game, my assessment is true. I am not a YouTuber, and I am not a Streamer, I am just that regular everyday person who really wanted this game to be good, and  it just isn't which is sad. I promise I don't regret spending the money on the packs, my annoyance with that is that the pack odds seems to favor 2K and again- their idea of making money off people. Plain and simple please stop buying 2K games and spending your money on this company. At the end of the day this company cares about one thing, and that is themselves. They make billions of dollars from players every year, and every year this game does not improve, mainly their servers, what could be the best aspect of this game, playing online with your buddy from across the country, turns into an unplayable lag fest. Never invest your time or money into a company that is littered with microtransactions and allows people to be pay to win. I just wish NBA Live would return and be somewhat decent, that may give 2K a reason to go back and do better and realize what use to make this game fun in the first place. Do Not Buy."

66037976,english,0,1089350,"If you're a MyCareer player, like me, expect to be sorely disappointed by the quality of this game.  The CPU players routinely make inexplicable decisions, especially on defense, and you will often find your team perfectly set defensively, only for one of your teammates to suddenly leave a 3-point shooter wide open because he wants to switch the match-up. This has been a problem since NBA 2k17, and I don't think it will change for a very long time. While I appreciated NBA 2k19 for the quality of the collisions, NBA 2k20 has gone backwards massively, and you will often see players going through each other. For example, you will see a defender's hand go through the ball as he's trying to block a shot (without a block registering), or you might find yourself in perfect position to defend, only for the ball handler to go through you and find himself wide open in front of the basket. The way in which the game plays is extremely unrealistic. All teams play exactly the same offensively, i.e. the ball handler gets the ball, he triggers some useless offensive motion, then sits around while the shot clock counts down and then shoots a contested jumper. Defensively there are only minor differences related to how they treat pick and rolls and mismatches. Hall of fame difficulty, just like previous years, turns your teammates into secondary school calibre players, unable to make even the simplest plays, like pass to a wide open teammate, knock down open jumpers (which especially applies to top tier shooters), and sometimes refuse to shoot an open layup in front of the basket, instead preferring to make 2-3 useless pump fakes, during which the defender gets back into position, and then air-ball a contested layup. Conversely, the Hall of Fame CPU is moved into a Godlike tier. Do not be mistaken, this does not mean they are smarter, or more skilled. They still trigger useless offense, and run around with no purpose, however, they just make impossible plays. There is the classic example of the heavily contested three as the shot clock winds down, but even if that misses, you will find that the HOF CPU will dominate the boards, and will have a 99% chance of boxing out the defending rebounder. This applies regardless of who is fighting for the rebound, so a player like Jayson Tatum will somehow manage to push Andre Drummond out of the way and grab an improbable rebound, then dunk the ball like Shaq. Instead of making the experience of playing on Hall of Fame fun and challenging, they just made it purely frustrating and unrealistic and I do not recommend anyone to buy this game, unless they wish to try other modes."

Online play is non-existent. Don't even bother.  The increased difficulty in MyLeague make me want to come back to the game mode every single time I play. 2K have nerfed some parts of the stat system like a players potential. Someone who's A+ in potential may only shine if he has players who revolve around his play-style. Although, I find that you need a star in order to win a championship. Mediocre 80 overalls won't get you anywhere but the second round.  Virtual currency is very lenient this game. You can get an easy 1500 each game. They implemented a progression feature with the MyCareer character that allows you to progress through basketball. The progression blocks the player from increasing overalls. But, it allows the character to develop in a realistic fashion, although, very grindy. That's why I mentioned the MyLeague option.

No matter what 2K promises the servers will never be good, because if 2K can manage to save any money for in exchange for in game performance, you'll be safe to bet a billion dollars that they will surrender customer experience for MONEY. Shot contest is a joke. You can contest a shot / layup and be given 'good shot contest' only for the shot to go in.   Don't buy the game now. Wait until next year. The game will be much more polished ( hopefully ) and you will have a better experience compared to buying it right now.   In totality, 2K is so out of touch with their community and game. Simple bugs and glitches aren't even noticed by the dev team, but are noticed within the first 20 minutes of launch by the community. They released another un-finished product per usual."
64035026,english,0,1089350,"The game has significantly regressed since 2k18, AI defense is non-existent and the game is riddled with milestone barriers which require extensive grinding or pay to win microtransactions.   On top of that, 2k is a company going to way of EA in terms of business practice and ethics. The fact that this game has passed ESRB gambling bans despite being filled with roulette wheels, slot machines and card packs/loot boxes seems puzzling until you realise that the chair of the ESRB and the president of 2k is the same person.  Buy 2k18 and get a roster update, you'll have a better time."

There are actual interactions before games that tell you your clothes suck you should buy new ones, which of course cost VC. Your character in MyCareer might as well not even try to take any shots or layups until you can upgrade them. I've literally watched shots that were perfect jump out of the hoop, breaking the games physics because it was determined by a number it wasnt good. Everything about this games design is made to make you spend extra money on a $60 or more purchase and with 2k21 even worse and costing $70 at base, 2k is probably more predatory and worse than EA at this point. NBA 2k used to be a great franchise but they are now neutering their game to push predatory microtransactions"

It's just not fun. I won't even talk about microtransactions because this year they just went beyond themselves.

How can you expect a 65-70 overall to compete with NBA level talent? That's just criminal of 2k. Huge skill gap.

70878259,english,1,1089350,"[list] [h1]🔹Positive Aspects:[/h1] [*]Impressive visuals and face scans. [*]Huge variety in modes. [*]Soundtrack. [*]Best gameplay as far as basketball games go.  [h1]🔸Negative Aspects:[/h1] [*]Servers. [*]Major gameplay inconsistencies. [*]MyCareer is basically a grind game.   [h1]▶️Introduction[/h1] NBA 2K20 is the latest addition to the NBA 2K lineup which exists for almost 2 decades now. The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/2K]2K.[/url]  Release Date : 5th September 2019. Last known update: 29th May 2020.   [h1]🎮Gameplay:[/h1]  [b]Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?[/b]  [list] [*] [b]Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:[/b] Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasn’t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.  [*] [b]Gamemodes:[/b] [i][b]Play Now[/b][/i]: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include [b]Play WNBA[/b] that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, [b]NBA Today[/b] that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,[b]Play Now Online[/b] is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly [b]Blacktop[/b] which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to. [i][b]My Team[/b][/i]: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed. [i][b]My Career[/b][/i]: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and you’re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues. [i][b]My League[/b][/i]: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. [b]My GM[/b] Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.  [h1]🌇Graphics / Audio:[/h1] Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals. [list] [*] [b]Graphics:[/b]  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1865032563  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1859551512  [*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack:[/b] The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well. [/list]  [h1]🌀Performance:[/h1] [b][/b] [*] [b]In Game:[/b] AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S: I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the cap  Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500: Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.  [*] [b]🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b] The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues. [/list]  [h1]💲Price:[/h1] For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.  [h1]⚖️Conclusion:[/h1] NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.

58646642,english,1,1089350,"90% of what I play in this game is single player. I have read reviews about the multiplayer being filled with bugs and I can't speak to that. I also only paid $30 for it which I feel is fair. You know what you get with NBA2k: an unethical $60 price tag for a game that should be free to play with all the microtransactions. If you are a fan of the last 4 2k games nothing in this one will surprise you, but you're likely to like this one as well. Same game as the last one, same microtransactions as the last one, still fun for an NBA fan imo. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME."

64263070,english,0,1089350,"I don't often take time to review games on Steam, but this needs to be said. This game is a huge piece of garbage. I fully expected coming in that this would basically be a re-release of an old game with new rosters. That's just what these sports games are, yet people pluck them up for $60 every year.  I picked this up on sale for $20, so I was pretty tolerant of issues coming in. In short, this game is a [b]nearly unplayable buggy Gatorade/Beats/Express commercial[/b]. Hell, for all the in your face product placement (way more than you think) this may as well be free to play. This review sponsored by Gatorade GX, change the way you refuel. Beats.  Bugs: Here are just a few of the bugs you can expect to see: [list]   [*]Seemingly random crashes to desktop at any given moment. Especially fun after you've played 30+ minutes of your MyCareer game and you lose all your progress.   [*] If you set your refresh rate to anything higher than the 60hz default, then when you simulate to your next appearance in a MyCareer game, the game slows down to a crawl. It will not begin simulating until after about 1 minute of this and/or after you alt+tab a few times to ""kick start"" it.   [*] Online neighborhood games are often a lagfest, and there is a constant underlying latency added to your shot timing. Essentially you need to completely re-adjust how you shoot when playing online. This isn't game breaking, but it sure as hell is annoying. [/list]  Other comments:  In fairness to this game, when the MyCareer isn't crashing, it's actually quite fun. You can tell they expect you to grind to become a half decent player, and that feels a little more heavy handed than older versions I've played. This is likely a ploy to get you to spend your hard earned money on more VC so that you can actually compete, but to be honest it didn't take that much work for me to get to an 80 overall, and with smart play you can still be a competent player. Also, all of my experience has been in MyCareer mode. I've heard MyLeague/MyTeam are fun, and I can't personally attest to how stable those modes are. But know that if MyCareer is what you are after, you are probably going to be frustrated.  Honestly, for a game that does so little to innovate every year, you would think they would at least fix the bugs. However, they still sell every year without fixing anything so I won't hold my breath. I should note that when googling the random crash to desktop issue, I've found forum posts from NBA2K18 complaining about the same issue. Awesome.  Final Verdict: Don't buy this POS on Steam. The PC version isn't stable enough for an early access alpha let alone a ""AAA"" release. If you must play this game, I highly recommend you get it on console. I assume it actually functions there."
63411931,english,0,1089350,"I actually enjoy the game. I mainly play MyLeague. My problem is that the steam version constantly crashes during games without even an error message. I will play 47 minutes of a game and it will crash and I will end up simulating/replaying the game I just about finished. (very annoying) There are some other issues with the game as far as lacking design and features. (For example, you must select your favorite offensive plays at the start of each game. Those settings should persist between games in my opinion) They are not deal breakers, but the crashing bugs are not enough for me to choose the steam or pc versions over the Xbox/PlayStation versions. (Assuming those don't crash)"
54990744,english,0,1089350,"I sadly cannot recommend this game at this time.  The game makers should be embarrassed.  Steam should be embarrassed they sold this crap.  Right now, in its current state, the game is not at all playable.   The first thing you notice is it takes forever just to connect after you download.   When you get into the game, even on my 4K computer, it runs with latency.  At 4k resolution, the game will not let you run faster than 30 mhz refresh rate.  At 60 mhz and at about half resolution, the frame rate is terrible even on low settings.  The game videos do not play but instead give you a choppy green screen.  If you get passed all that and can get to MyPlayer and make a character, you'll find more issues.  The menus do not always work. Especially when simply trying to exit. Hit A. Nothing happens. You have to minimize and then close the application and restart.  So you're building a player. Sometimes it will let you choose what he looks like and sometimes it'll just send you straight to ability making.  After you choose your position, your ratings for various stats, etc, and you save your player, when you go to load it, you will something else. Like I made a Shooting Guard that can Slash to the basket. I ended up with a Small Forward with a different ability. I made a center playmaker and ended up with a Center paint defender.   With my center, I was shooting deep 3's and did not miss a single shot. On either player I created, I did not miss a shot. I did not play very many minutes, but still did not miss a shot in maybe a dozen or more attempts.   After all of this, I decided to ask for a refund, so unaware of what other problems there lies in other modes of the game or further along in a game or in MyStory mode beyond a few minutes. I am sure there are other issues.   This has been my experience with this product."

I remember thinking of how improvements to the game could be like, adding button/stick prompts to give interactive high-5s to build team chemistry, or being able to complain to refs, or shove someone, or pick up a tech. Instead, Ronnie 2k (the dude who makes these games) decided to lock me out of my 334 hour MyCareer playthrough to try and make me buy his new online product bloated with microtransactions. Shame.

I'm not carrying on you got my point, this game is trash.

Not that the game itself is bad, they're fun for sure, but we're paying out hundreds of dollars to essentially ""rent"" a game for a couple of years and then bam, they end it and you can't even play any more unless you shell out hundreds more and start all over again.

Its sad that big companies like Take-Two Interactive ruin games. KSP may be less popular than GTA or other big titles made by Take Two, but that is no excuse for just abandoning the game. KSP has a community, a community which had hopes to get a better, more extensive KSP. These hopes were crushed by some corporate people who dont really care about the game.  They care about one thing, and one thing only: Money.  For them, a video game is only a product, like a pack of pasta in the supermarket. Of course, a company wants to make profit, but they forgot one thing. Us, the gamers, the people who buy their products.

No updates in sight and knowing what happened with the studio that was developing this game, I think it's pretty safe to say that Kerbal Space Program 2 is officially 6 feet under.  I love KSP. The first game is one of my favorite games of all time, and I've spent many an hour screwing around with rocketry, blowing things up and learning along the way. I love space, I love space travel, and I love science, so in many ways KSP was an ideal game for me. That's why, as a huge fan of the original, it really does hurt to have seen the much-anticipated sequel be dragged through the mud, taken to the backyard and have a shotgun pressed against the back of its head. It sucks. Corporations really do ruin everything.  My advice to anybody who may read this, if indeed there are still people out there looking at this game, don't buy it. The game is done. If you want to play KSP, buy the first game. It doesn't get updated anymore, but it's still one of the most enjoyable experiences in gaming, whether you want to do things properly or just want to watch some fuel tanks explode (and 'accidentally' kill a bunch of astronauts while you're at it). The first game has a wonderful modding community with some of the most dedicated and talented modders I've personally ever seen outside of games like Skyrim or Minecraft. Essentially, the first game can be everything the second was meant to be, minus all of the bugs, crappy UI, astronomically high (pun not intended) system requirements, and broken dreams, of course.  As for KSP 2, well, I hate to say it, but this game belongs in the trash heap. I wouldn't say it's solely the developers' fault, but also Take Two for burning the studio down and, unfortunately, ruining what could have been a great game. Another lesson to remember, never pre-order games, especially not AAA ones."

178208145,english,0,954850,"""Kerbal Space Program 2"" is, without exaggeration, a monumental failure, a masterclass in how to ruin a beloved franchise, and an insult to anyone who trusted this development team with a sliver of hope. This so-called sequel is a sick joke—a buggy, broken, and utterly hollow disaster that doesn’t even deserve to be associated with the original *KSP*. The result is a toxic mix of empty promises, neglected fundamentals, and cynical greed.  First off, the performance issues are so shockingly severe that it’s a miracle the game even boots up. Calling it ‘poorly optimized’ would be generous; *KSP 2* feels like it was cobbled together by amateurs. It turns your PC into a glorified space heater, struggling under the weight of shoddy code that produces frame rates straight out of the Stone Age. It’s infuriating to play even the simplest missions when everything lags, crashes, and stalls as if the game is actively sabotaging you. How the developers let this heap of trash pass as a “finished” product defies logic.  The physics—the one aspect they absolutely could not afford to mess up—is a nonsensical mess. Rockets behave in absurd ways, randomly losing stability, ignoring logic, and self-destructing as if the game engine is being held together with chewing gum and hope. The once-satisfying challenge of engineering space missions has been turned into a tedious exercise in fighting against the broken mechanics of a game that’s forgotten what made it special. Calling this a ‘simulation’ of anything other than a money grab is laughable.  As for content, there’s practically nothing here. Where are the colonies? The promised interstellar travel? The new features that justified making a sequel in the first place? The game is a barren wasteland, barely distinguishable from the original, but with far fewer features and countless times the aggravation. The developers had years to build upon the foundation of *KSP*, but instead, they’ve delivered a stripped-down, soulless husk. It feels like they stopped developing halfway through and figured fans would be too blinded by nostalgia to notice.  And then there’s the utter disregard for the community. The developers’ silence is a slap in the face, demonstrating a level of disrespect that would be shocking if it weren’t so infuriating. It’s as though they thought they could cash in on the *KSP* brand name and quietly hope players wouldn’t notice the disaster they’d created. Updates are rare and ineffective, and when they do come, they barely scratch the surface of the game’s mountain of issues. It’s a blatant, greedy cash grab, with zero care for the quality or integrity of the product they’re selling.  ""Kerbal Space Program 2"" isn’t just a failure—it’s an abomination. It’s a scam dressed up in a familiar title, hoping to squeeze money out of loyal fans before they realize they’ve been duped. Stay away from this unholy wreck of a game. If you buy *KSP 2*, you’re not just wasting your money; you’re rewarding laziness, incompetence, and a complete betrayal of what *Kerbal Space Program* once stood for."

The fact that your still making money from this and probably the company too is insane. I'll keep that in mind next time i buy half of a shirt from Target."
164409609,english,0,954850,"With today's announcement that Take-Two has laid off the entirety of Intercept Games (confirmed per Bloomberg), I'll finally write my review, which is something I had held off doing until my last drop of hope evaporated. KSP2's development was not as controversial as many online would have you believe, especially compared to more scandalous ones, but for me it is by far the most disappointed I've ever been with a video game.  KSP2 was announced in August of 2019 at Gamescon, slated to release in 2020 by Star Theory Games, formerly known as Uber Entertainment. Wikipedia states:  ""For various reasons, the release date was pushed back to Q3 2021.""  This is a really funny sentence to me in 2024, knowing that the early access (EA) release would not be coming until a year and a half after that date. During this time, Take-Two established a new studio under Private Division called Intercept Games, poaching a dozen employees from Star Theory, including creative director Nate Simpson and lead producer Nate Robinson. The game would continue a long string of announced delays with little communication and progress updates in between, foreshadowing what was to come. Finally, in October of 2022, an early access release date of February 24, 2023 was announced. The date was, for once, one Intercept Games would stick to. Along with this announcement came a road map of major features for future updates, which outlined the following: early access, science, colonies, interstellar, exploration, and multiplayer, to be release chronologically over an unrevealed timeline. The hype that had died down over the years was [mostly] restored, and Intercept Games had bitten off more than they could chew.  Before I get into the release, I want backtrack a bit and have everyone watch the Cinematic Announcement Trailer that was released 4 years ago:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_nj6wW6Gsc&  Who is responsible for this? It is by far the best game trailer I've ever seen. It EMBODIES what players love about Kerbal Space Program: the mystique of other worlds, the scale of space, the clumsiness of Kerbals, and the drive we have to succeed after failure. The latter two quite literally embody the Kerbal way, as anyone from KSP1 who has stranded their loyal astronauts on Duna or straight up murdered them on the launchpad can confirm. If you were involved in any way with this trailer, give yourself a huge pat on the back. It may very well be the only good thing Intercept Games ever accomplished.  Two weeks before the early access release, ESA held a preview event where content creators could play the game for a few hours. Many of these content creators recording themselves playing and something seemed, well, off. You can see it in their eyes and the way they talk about the game. The very framework which would support every roadmap feature was not built on solid ground.  Two weeks later, early access was released. I recall some buzzing in the discord in the days before release about the frame rate, but Intercept has a history of being proactive with the ban hammer and anyone who commented these things was swiftly removed. Forced positivity was the subterfuge they needed to convince themselves that what was about to release was worth a fraction of the resources that had supposedly been poured into it. To cut a long story short, release day was a complete and utter disaster. Performance was abymsal with many high end systems topping out at 15fps, crafts were generally wonky and not in the ""Kerbal"" way, anti-aliasing looked jagged, maneuver nodes were busted (if you could even manage to get to space in the first place), no reentry heating, and an unlimited number of other failures all reared their ugly faces. Even the tutorials themselves didn't feel like KSP. Wrap all those mistakes into a $50 price tag and it's not hard to see why KSP2's player count dipped below KSP1 within days of launch. I'm not going to pretend like I stuck it out and spent my time troubleshooting and reporting bugs to make the game better. I did what any sensible person would do and asked Steam for a refund.  The period that followed went as you would aspect: poor damage control. Intercept gaslighted their fan base and ruled with an iron first on their forums and Discord server. Nate occasionally posted updates on their forums, filled with so much technical jargon it made reading them a bigger chore than booting up the game itself. Other than that, there was a lot of radio silence. I encourage everyone to give this website a whirl, which displays the scale of our solar system if the Moon was only 1 pixel:  https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html  While you're scrolling, imagine each planet is an update given by Nate on the development of KSP2. The analogy works. Trust me.  In October of 2023, Nate gave a speech at Space Creator Day, in which he outlined some of KSP2's development problems before announcing the first roadmap update, For Science!, which ended up releasing in December of 2023. Performance had improved throughout 2023, and For Science! would give players objectives to work towards, but many of the release day issues remained unsolved, and many questions were still unanswered, like:  How could a planned release date of 2020 be delayed three years into a rushed EA release? Why did you double down on Unity knowing the same limitations would still be there? And ten thousand others you can scour the Internet for in your free time.  There is something really special about Kerbal Space Program. It feels unique, quirky, and most of the time, it just works. Games in this position are invaluable, and very hard to follow up with successful successors. Cities: Skylines 2 and Roller Coaster Tycoon World are more recent examples of games that, by and large, failed to recapture any of what made their predecessors unique. Even at its best, which it rarely ever was, KSP2 never felt like KSP1. Sid Meier once said his design philosophy for designing and creating his games is to ""play them, over and over, until they are fun."" It's clear that Meier's wisdom was never present in the development of KSP2, since it was never at any point any fun. Such is the early access fate, and shame on all of us for buying into it again. No lessons will be learned and will all be stewing in our anger in a few months at the next major letdown.  Kerbal Space Program 2 set its sights on the stars. Unfortunately, it sits abandoned at the launch site, having never even taken flight.  Take-Two ruins everything they get their hands on. F*** Take-Two."

The purchaser? A private equity firm, Haveli Investments. Annapurna Interactive had all 25 of their employees resign on September of 2024. Apparently those employees intend to create a new company and take over the portfolio. This company doesn't even have a name yet.   Basically, this game lost traction, before anything can happen with this game entire companies must be created, staffed, and then they have to put this game on the list of games to be worked on.   You can essentially just google Kerbal Space Program 2 and find out very quickly that the Overwhelmingly Negative reviews are 100% valid, justified, and the customers who have been unfortunate enough to buy into this game were sold an intent to make a game, when there was no intent to actually produce the game and instead sold off as they bid adieu with a middle finger in our general direction."

Frankly given that this game was used by the parent company take2 interactive through the proxy company private division as a cash grab, it should be delisted as a scam, but at the very least, the store page should be updated to correctly display the current state of the game.

164231839,english,1,954850,"Given the chaos and turmoil surrounding the shutdown of Intercept games, I want to put up my two cents. KSP2 is getting reviews bombed left and right from people upset and scared that an enjoyed and anticipated title may be shut down.  I don't believe the game deserves the Negative Review Bombing it is currently undergoing because  Take2 chose to lay off the developer team.  In fact, in doing so I think it is doing more harm to the chances of the game than good.  If you are like me and are upset and frustrated due to these layoffs and the potential of this game's shut down then don't leave a negative review here and scream into the void.  Rather go to Private Division. leave messages and reviews there. Let them know this title is still one we want and await. Honestly, there are things wrong with the game but its early access, and anyone who buys it should know what that means.  that being said I want to point out just a few things.   1. This is not the first time that KSP2 has changed developers 2. Intercept Games has stated that the project still will be updated 3. there has been no announcement to the cancellation of the KSP2 Project.  4. While a public announcement was made on the 1st, by law such closures need to be disclosed in advance.  Intercept knew this was coming yet updates were still launched, dev updates were made. and news flowed.  KSP2 was not killed on the spot  In short, will it cause delay, yeah no doubt. but I don't think its dead in the water yet. There is still a chance that the torch will be passed to another Dev team and that things will move again. However, if we let the backlash of the closure of the Intercept cause mass waves of negative reviews then they may take that at face value.  and just assume we dont want this title anymore.   And I get it not everyone has it in them to stay hopeful or positive, but at the least to those who read this, and wish to leave a review put the anger where it is due, and choose your words constructively. I want this title to see its completion. And I am willing to wait for it. if things shut down they shut down, but it does not cost me anything more to remain hopeful and to choose to wait and see what might come."

The developers wanted to make art and have the fans participate in the creation and evolution of that art through Early Access play and feedback into 1.0 release and beyond. They had grand plans for the game, we knew this since the announcement. The owners of the IP (who bought it off the original makers of the game) wanted to print money off the name recognition of the first game IMMEDIATELY without spending the money to make the sequel title at least serviceable to launch in Early Access. The two philosophies in game development were not symbiotic, one is quite parasitic. Take Two rushed the developers to release something, anything, right MEOW and they were forced to do just that. When the game didn't make money hand-over-fist because what was released into Early Access was well-below what is expected for a public release in Early Access, and the result was and still is rightly SAVAGED in reviews, the developers were stabbed in the back by Take Two who put them in this position to begin with, were laid off and their studio folded into oblivion.  This game is dead and unlikely to be revived by Take Two. Don't buy it. We paid so that you didn't have to. This game was a Titanic.

I hope your business runs super efficiently and enhances your margin profile with the money you stole from the Kerbal Space Program community. You have not invested in future growth. I will never buy a Take Two game again. What are the names of the execs who did this? #Accountability
166171096,english,0,954850,"The corporate entity that promised to develop this game, and then ditching it while still charging so much money should be denylisted by Steam. Steam you have an obligation to protect your customers, not these suspicious entities."
166001184,english,0,954850,"KSP1 was the first game I ever bought (yes, before Minecraft) all the way back in 2011 for the non-discounted price of £7, and so I bought KSP2 on launch day. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtMA594am4M]ShadowZone's video[/url] really goes into a deep dive of the very troubled development behind KSP2 from 2017 until now, if you care about KSP then it's a very painful (but worthwhile) watch. Long story short, Take-Two's upper management managed this game horribly and KSP2 is mostly just refactored KSP1 code, rather than starting from scratch and designing the code from the ground up to support new features like multiplayer and colonies. Now Intercept Games has been (or shortly will be) closed down as a result of Take-Two forcing them to release a bad product and this game won't receive any further updates. Incredibly disappointing."

Disappointing.  Edit: for some reason there is still a roadmap for future releases on the store page as of 6/27. The last day of the development team per the WARN documents is 6/28."

Everyone should be able to get refunds from this product and it should be taken from the steam library immediately unless there is a message posted mentioning that private division no longer exists.

That is just a scam. And we didn't even think about the employees who lost their job.  But now to the game itself: We all bought it and we were upset because it was just extremely buggy and unpleasant to play. Then fixes came, the game improved and we all could enjoy it... more or less... The first major update came with ""For Science!"". We were again full of hopes, we were looking forward to the next updates. And then came the devastating message: Private Divsion was laid of.    Its sad that big companies like Take-Two Interactive ruin games. KSP may be less popular than GTA or other big titles made by Take Two, but that is no excuse for just abandoning the game. KSP has a community, a community which had hopes to get a better, more extensive KSP. These hopes were crushed by some corporate people who dont really care about the game.  They care about one thing, and one thing only: Money.  For them, a video game is only a product, like a pack of pasta in the supermarket. Of course, a company wants to make profit, but they forgot one thing. Us, the gamers, the people who buy their products. For us, KSP isnt just a product, for us it's something special and for some of us it may be even a passion.  It is sad that these passions can be crushed only because of some corporate idiots who only care about the money.  We expected to conquer the galay, build colonies, make kerbalkind a interplanetary species, but these hopes were denied just for another game to take KSP2's place."

Let's just do a little timeline of events:  2017/18 - Development must have started 2019 - Cinematic Release Trailer posted, promising a 2020 Full Release (I must stress this, it was to be a fully released game in 2020) 2020 - Delayed to 2021 (Fair enough covid was a pain) 2021 - Delayed to FY22  2022 - Announced for 2023 as Early Access 2023 (Feb) - Released as EA for full Price. 2023 (Dec) - First Update on Roadmap after months without any updates. 2024 (Apr) - Dev Studio Laid Off after under performing and failing to meet T2's rather reasonable expectations after 6-8yrs.  What we were advertised initially was a Full Game to be released in 2020. What we got was not even a 6th of the game, 3 years late (5-6yrs in development), in an Early Access state, paid for at a the price of Fully Released Triple A games, more than the price of KSP1 plus both DLC packs, but coming with less features than KSP1.  The current state of the game is similar to KSP1 v0.19 back in 2013, when KSP1 was $23 and receiving updates almost every month. Mean whilst KSP2 has been out for now 7 months and has received 3 updates and 2 hot fixes, which have not added any features.  The worst thing about this game is what it did to my motivation to play the origional, I stopped playing KSP1 as much with the announcement of KSP2s eventual release date as i was looking forward to playing what I, and I think most people also, expected to essentially be KSP1 as it was but with better graphics, sound design, and a better (both in accuracy and performance) physics engine. But no, what was released has questionable graphics (some better some worse), and uses the exact same physics engine with the exact same bugs that were in KSP1 but were dealt with by fixes and features that are missing from the current game (despite being promised by the devs, that features such as Autostrut, would be present at launch, to the Content Creators when told about how critical it was at a content creator event in advance of the launch.)  You'll notice I missed out any comments on the sound design, thats because it is the one thing that has been done categorically better than KSP1 without fail, the guys doing sound design at IG are awesome and honestly wasting there talents on KSP2. Would be far better to have a Paid DLC for KSP1 porting over that sounb design for engines and music.  TL;DR Don't buy if you love and still play KSP1. It will ruin your motivation to play a game you love. P.S. IG, please, go do a music and SFX DLC for KSP1, I will give you money."

As of writing this, Colonies, Interstellar travel, Multiplayer are non-existent in the game and sue to the state of the development are false claims being used to sell the idea of a game that will never be complete. I cannot comment on the state of modding support but have gathered from the modding community it was not left in a good state of support.   Frankly given that this game was used by the parent company take2 interactive through the proxy company private division as a cash grab, it should be delisted as a scam, but at the very least, the store page should be updated to correctly  display the current state of the game.

At the same time, according to public information, the development team was sold by the publisher, and the last update was released more than six months ago. In this case, the sale of the game is an exceptional fraud. I am sure that the publisher must be responsible for fraudulent actions. I really hope that the steam team will be able to take the necessary actions to protect the interests of their clients.

156148994,english,0,954850,"I loved the original KSP, and got a lot of decent time in with this one. I think I'll probably sink a few hundred hours in. I love space games and Newtonian physicals models. I also have a high tolerance for early access games. I don't think the typical user will enjoy playing this yet, so I can't recommend it. I hope that changes, but it's hard to understand such a large step back.  I don't want to just negatively review and move on. Devs, I hope the following can be helpful and that the points I raise are constructive. Since this is an alpha, consider this the results of my alpha testing. This list is non-exhaustive. I have actually run out of space in the review.  Ranked vaguely in order of most annoying:  - Parachutes have a 25%ish chance to fail to deploy. This has nothing to do with any mechanic. If you revert the save, they might work this time. Or they might not.  - Attempting to edit a maneuver node, and the process of intercepting, is extremely frustrating. There are so many layers to this issue, from bugs to opinionated design choices, to farthest-from-optimal action flow.  - The game simply will not allow you to use the marker system if you are out of fuel. It will also not allow you to expand markers past where you would run out of fuel. The issue is, it's only counting the fuel in your current stage. Got leftover fuel in a stage you want to use? Ditch it. It's not worth losing the ability to plot your next course. lol. This is one of the most annoying things in this game, and it's an intended feature, not a bug. If you can't make it to your destination on one stage, you're going to have to burn halfway, and hope you eyeballed it well enough that your next stage isn't going to have to throw away a crapload of fuel fixing your imprecision.   - You cannot create or modify a course marker while the game is paused. Again, this is a feature and not a bug for some reason.   Aside: NASA has all their maneuvers calculated months before the launch. It gets programmed into a computer;the engineers sit back and drink coffee while the telemetry comes in. You can use an Orrery to see where celestial bodies will be years and years from now. You're really not going to let me take a two-minute timeout to ad-hoc my next step in the process of getting to another planet? I need momentum to even plot my first course, which means I can't take a first swing at figuring out what my plan is until I have an orbit. I've thought about using a dummy payload in orbit of kerbin to plot a course before I launch, but that would mean doing it all twice with the horrible course plotting experience, and the dummy payload would need a stupid amount of deltaV just to let me use the marker system to plan a route anywhere interesting.  - toggling timewarp too quickly will cause the game to lose track of its state. IE, the game will report time is paused while time is actually at 1-4x speed. This issue compounds the previously mentioned ""feature"" where you can't plot courses while ""paused,"" or even modify the thrust you have set. It's great hurling towards a planet at high speed, essentially shaking the soda machine in a panic trying to get it back into the working condition.  - Any ships you have in a given sphere of influence will supersede it on the minimap, and you cannot target or focus the celestial body without a really annoying 10+ second scroll session or 10ish clicks. You literally have to press your face against the planet to target it. Devs, you can assume that if I am looking at the star map from location A, controlling a vehicle there, that I do not want information about vehicles at location B. My camera is literally a billion kilometres away from those guys. If I want to see them, I can scroll in. It's infinitely more likely that I want to click on the planet, so I that I can plot a course to it. Just don't show the markers for these other ships unless my camera is at their perspective. (IE, ship in low Duna orbit should not be visible [much less overriding its parent body] from interstellar distances the camera views the Kerbol System from.  - minimap elements become distorted and overlap other elements of the map  - inconsistent course markers on the map view showing jittery distances despite an unobstructed course, making it impossible to accurately plot.  - it is very difficult to plot small changes >3 delta V. You are better off guessing and checking with an engine set to 1% thrust limiter, fishing for the course that will reduce your apogee manually. This is inefficient and time consuming, and it would be great to have the game do a little more to help you when you need a precise course change.  - Game will incorrectly report your current deltaV, or overall deltaV, on a variety of different screens and interfaces.   - Course information will sometimes jitter, and the game will report your perigee over a range of several kilometers. I see it most on a course from one planet to another, This makes it impossible to reliably set a course to aerobrake.  - Rotating parts in the VAB using WASDQE sometimes makes them unplacable on snap points.  - Staging often requires two clicks or spacebar presses, leading to a profound sense of dread wondering if this is the one where your rocket snaps in half and disintegrates because you staged twice.  - My last rocket was fairly excessive, but I was trying to get a payload of three vessels to Juul. It had 33 engines firing on the first stage, all small - medium parts, since that's where I was in the career mode. It might have been a stretch doing so much at once, but the game lets me, and it gave me the mission to get there knowing my constraints. Anyway, staging 12 SRBs at a time, my game would drop to 0 fps for 5-10 seconds. Literally no information from the display except whatever still image it landed on. Then, eventually, time would resume and the boosters begin to fall away.  - Debris sometimes becomes stuck midair above the space center only a few km in the air. I believe I have hit this derbies several times, but it's hard to tell with the lag happening up there, The debris sits at the altitude where I do my first/second stage. I think the game just gives up on the physics for spent fuel tanks.    - No way to filter debris off the map besides manually destroying each piece you leave behind at the tracking station.  - Test a fairing on the pad before you rely on it to release the payload. Trust me. The system is not very intuitive, and you cannot imagine my saddness watching a still-fully-encapsulated probe drifting away from my ship, and having no way whatsoever to release it.  - You will sometimes be unable to move or maneuver a ship that should be fully controllable, forcing a restart of the game  - My game has only ever alt-tabbed without crashing once. This is not an exaggeration.  - Ultrawide and 4k resolutions not supported natively  - Parts have no associated monetary cost, making the objectives in career mode feel a little bit lackluster. I can get anywhere if you let me use as many parts as I want. I'd recommend giving the user a money slider from infinite to soviet in order to add a layer of difficulty tailored to the individual's preferences  Summary: The bugs combine to make an incredibly frustrating experience. Bugs and game design choices amplify each other.  Career mode is cooler than KSP1. Lots of potential in the game. Just really a lot of technical debt to get through, and obviously since the game is feature incomplete, it will continue to be unstable for some time into the future. I think the devs can one day succeed at making Kerbal more accessible. I'm having a lot more fun playing campaign so far. I think the story they're putting together is cute, and they did a great job capturing the character of the original game. There are some great QOL improvements, like the ability to quickly set a course via button press, speed up time to markers, and plenty more. Hoping for good things."
133806368,english,0,954850,"As of its current state - I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING NOR PLAYING THIS GAME.  The fact that this even was considered to being released ignoring that abuse of Early Access does not justify the price tag and chaotic state of which this game is currently at.  Can we please stop treating Early Access as a term for Developers ramping up the Price and not caring a bit about if the game is actually you know functional.  This game promised a lot back in 2020 - and even promised to be released years earlier - and yet we're in 2023, with almost none of the features as well as missing the most basic of features from the first game.  I honestly cannot tell at this point if this game was even in development back when they said they were planning to release of if they simply kept redrawing their entire game without actually developing ontop of what they had.  This game is a joke of the first game as well as a mockery of Early Access Titles - honestly if the game isn't ready and needs beta testing do not post it as an premium ""early access"" when we're just paying to be a beta tester.   I'm extremely disappointed with the developers and with the fanbase who let this happen with not just this game but also with many other titles that abuse and misuse the term Early Access as Beta Channel.  EDIT: With the recent patch I'm more hopeful than before that KSP 2 might actually end up as a good game -  I also don't ignore the fact that KSP 1 was very different when it first released but due to the lack of attention and the lack of comparison there was no fallout. Where as this time there's an entire game to compare this too as well as a large audience.   I support the developers in actually helping to create this game, especially with their public outreach and support it brings me a lot of hope - what I'm annoyed about however is the publishers disconnect with the pricing and the understanding of what people are expecting from a £50 game.  As a Early Access buyer I hope that us forking up £50 for a game that's worth £10 or less should be rewarded in the future with some sort of special expansion or something at least to justify even being an EA user.  Publishers need to actually respect and understand the developers because if the developers aren't allowed to change the price to match the game public fallout will cost a lot more in the short and long term than any discounts would."

Promised a game. Nothing.  I've never had such a sour taste in my mouth from any game. To everyone involved in this scam, from the bottom of my heart, fuck you."

Its not finished, there are glitches, some of which hilarious, others not so much.  Its easier to grasp than KSP1, much better for all new players and the majority of older players that are not space nerds.  The sounds are amazing tbh, the music is better, the textures are better and the campaign is way better with a better progression tree.

Since the studio decided to just take millions of dollars in sales, deliver a buggy game, and update it almost zero prior to abandoning the title, I will no longer recommend the franchise.

Love it. I do not recommend KSP2 Early Access in it's current state.  Why this early access is important: This is not the same team or company that made KSP1. The KSP IP was bought by Private Division and is now owned by Take Two Interactive. Private Division has asked Take Two for more funding to develop the game. Take Two denied it. The result is Private Division releasing this minimum viable product sold at premium price to cover ongoing development costs.  What this means: Do not defend this under the idea that KSP1 became a smash hit, it shares nothing with it. Do not assume anything positive or negative about the capability of the team to succeed or fail. Do not assume that Take Two will treat this any differently than any of it's other licensed titles.  This is a net-new initiative, treat it like it is. You are paying $50 for an Early Access. You are buying a promise from a new team run by a large detached corporation. There are concerns.  I will update my recommendation once it feels beneficial, but at this time I do not recommend it. Their are prolific game breaking bugs, very minimal content, and frustrating mechanics. While $50 may not be a big deal, funding this type of practice should be a consideration and what you expect from your money. Spend as you will."

So hopefully Valve will take it off the store, since the store page is just trying to sell a dead product.

However, it comes at a steep price for an early access title and will likely only increase by 10-20 bucks when it leaves early access. Additionally, it's important to note that the game is currently very unoptimized and may not run well on most computers. So unless you meet the minimum requirements and are not too attached to your hard-earned money, I wouldn't recommend buying it just yet.

176716187,english,0,954850,"It's now mid October of 2024. No updates in sight and knowing what happened with the studio that was developing this game, I think it's pretty safe to say that Kerbal Space Program 2 is officially 6 feet under.  I love KSP. The first game is one of my favorite games of all time, and I've spent many an hour screwing around with rocketry, blowing things up and learning along the way. I love space, I love space travel, and I love science, so in many ways KSP was an ideal game for me. That's why, as a huge fan of the original, it really does hurt to have seen the much-anticipated sequel be dragged through the mud, taken to the backyard and have a shotgun pressed against the back of its head. It sucks. Corporations really do ruin everything.  My advice to anybody who may read this, if indeed there are still people out there looking at this game, don't buy it. The game is done. If you want to play KSP, buy the first game. It doesn't get updated anymore, but it's still one of the most enjoyable experiences in gaming, whether you want to do things properly or just want to watch some fuel tanks explode (and 'accidentally' kill a bunch of astronauts while you're at it). The first game has a wonderful modding community with some of the most dedicated and talented modders I've personally ever seen outside of games like Skyrim or Minecraft. Essentially, the first game can be everything the second was meant to be, minus all of the bugs, crappy UI, astronomically high (pun not intended) system requirements, and broken dreams, of course.  As for KSP 2, well, I hate to say it, but this game belongs in the trash heap. I wouldn't say it's solely the developers' fault, but also Take Two for burning the studio down and, unfortunately, ruining what could have been a great game. Another lesson to remember, never pre-order games, especially not AAA ones."

178208145,english,0,954850,"""Kerbal Space Program 2"" is, without exaggeration, a monumental failure, a masterclass in how to ruin a beloved franchise, and an insult to anyone who trusted this development team with a sliver of hope. This so-called sequel is a sick joke—a buggy, broken, and utterly hollow disaster that doesn’t even deserve to be associated with the original *KSP*. The result is a toxic mix of empty promises, neglected fundamentals, and cynical greed.  First off, the performance issues are so shockingly severe that it’s a miracle the game even boots up. Calling it ‘poorly optimized’ would be generous; *KSP 2* feels like it was cobbled together by amateurs. It turns your PC into a glorified space heater, struggling under the weight of shoddy code that produces frame rates straight out of the Stone Age. It’s infuriating to play even the simplest missions when everything lags, crashes, and stalls as if the game is actively sabotaging you. How the developers let this heap of trash pass as a “finished” product defies logic.  The physics—the one aspect they absolutely could not afford to mess up—is a nonsensical mess. Rockets behave in absurd ways, randomly losing stability, ignoring logic, and self-destructing as if the game engine is being held together with chewing gum and hope. The once-satisfying challenge of engineering space missions has been turned into a tedious exercise in fighting against the broken mechanics of a game that’s forgotten what made it special. Calling this a ‘simulation’ of anything other than a money grab is laughable.  As for content, there’s practically nothing here. Where are the colonies? The promised interstellar travel? The new features that justified making a sequel in the first place? The game is a barren wasteland, barely distinguishable from the original, but with far fewer features and countless times the aggravation. The developers had years to build upon the foundation of *KSP*, but instead, they’ve delivered a stripped-down, soulless husk. It feels like they stopped developing halfway through and figured fans would be too blinded by nostalgia to notice.  And then there’s the utter disregard for the community. The developers’ silence is a slap in the face, demonstrating a level of disrespect that would be shocking if it weren’t so infuriating. It’s as though they thought they could cash in on the *KSP* brand name and quietly hope players wouldn’t notice the disaster they’d created. Updates are rare and ineffective, and when they do come, they barely scratch the surface of the game’s mountain of issues. It’s a blatant, greedy cash grab, with zero care for the quality or integrity of the product they’re selling.  ""Kerbal Space Program 2"" isn’t just a failure—it’s an abomination. It’s a scam dressed up in a familiar title, hoping to squeeze money out of loyal fans before they realize they’ve been duped. Stay away from this unholy wreck of a game. If you buy *KSP 2*, you’re not just wasting your money; you’re rewarding laziness, incompetence, and a complete betrayal of what *Kerbal Space Program* once stood for."
175430535,english,0,954850,"The development of this game has been canceled indefinitely. The game is no longer receiving any form of development or updates. It had already been slow and suspicious, but now they've scrapped it all together. I really was hoping it wouldn't happen but it did. DO NOT BUY."
133783748,english,0,954850,"This is what happens when an incompetent development studio meets a greedy publisher.  This game was supposed to be released in 2020, as development began in 2017. We are getting a glorified tech demo in 2023 after multiple delayed release dates.   Yes, the game was likely pushed by the publisher and launched too early but who could blame them? They can't just keep throwing money and time at a development studio that obviously can't produce the game. The Q1 2023 release date was announced during a TakeTwo earnings call over a year ago, so don’t act like the devs haven’t had a YEAR to produce a stable release.  This game is not even remotely worth the price they are charging. Without going any further, $50 for an early access title is pushing it, $50 for this early access build of KSP2 is inexcusable. I can’t believe anyone involved with this game is happy asking people to spend $50 of their hard earned money for this, which they are because this “early access” title is being actively advertised.  The tech demo itself is a worse performing version of KSP1 with the most basic of parts, and no new features worth mentioning if you’re a fan of KSP1. The game is horribly optimized, the physics engine barely functions, the Kraken is worse than ever. By this point I am sure you’ve heard already the state of the demo if you’ve read this far. This could all be excused if the year was 2020 and they only charged $25-30, but again they are charging hard working people $50 to beta test their tech demo 3 years after the planned release date. To the “actually the game is discounted right now due to early access”, sorry but the $10 discount means nothing when they haven’t provided even provided 10% of what was supposed to be released years ago. I think early access is a great program and has produced some of my favorite games, but this is hardly ready to be put out.  No, I am not going to pay essentially full price now in anticipation of further development from the devs. That is not the purpose of the early access program. Rule 2 from Steam’s early access overview states that:  “2. Do not make specific promises about future events. For example, there is no way you can know exactly when the game will be finished, that the game will be finished, or that planned future additions will definitely happen. Do not ask your customers to bet on the future of your game. Customers should be buying your game based on its current state, not on promises of a future that may or may not be realized.” (Read the above rule again if you need to)   The devs have stated themselves on Steam:  “The 1.0 version of KSP 2 will include significantly more features than the Early Access version, such as what you see on the roadmap plus other items added along the way. This includes: · More parts and the opportunity for more creative builds · More star systems and hidden anomalies · Improved quality of life and onboarding to open up the vast beauty of space to even more players · Continued performance improvements and visual updates We can’t wait for you to join us on this journey into the stars!”  Based on the devs verbiage above, how are they not asking me to bet on the future of the game? They are asking me to pay $50 and hope they implement their planned roadmap when haven’t even proved they can make a functioning game. They can’t even release the most basic version of the game possible that isn’t objectively terrible after YEARS of development. Y'all are saying that you'd happily spend $50 for the game as is?  Anyone who worked on this game does not deserve a dime from the consumer. If that means KSP2 is cancelled then it is for the best. This release is a shameless cash grab by a publisher who needs to recoup costs from an incompetent development studio that has wasted years of production. I never thought these predatory business practices could happen to a franchise that has so much passion, from fans and the great people who worked on KSP1."

KSP 1 is slowly being improved by the community all the time which is by far and away better than halted development.  At this point, Take Two should just sell this IP for whoever would actually do a KSP 3 on a new engine like Godot properly, with a focus on mod extensibility and engine performance rather than promise and fail to deliver on scope creep.

Don't even try to use Early Access as excuse, all the features are gone, its a buggy mess and we been teased for years for a worthy successor of KSP. Just delete the whole project and port KSP to the new engine and fix the memory leaks.  This was the only game I really was looking forward to, but it says all when even Scott Manley tells his viewers in a ""nice"" way to stay away from the game in it current state. Hugly disappointed.

If my child's development was as poor as KSP2's development, I would have drowned her in a lake."
164409609,english,0,954850,"With today's announcement that Take-Two has laid off the entirety of Intercept Games (confirmed per Bloomberg), I'll finally write my review, which is something I had held off doing until my last drop of hope evaporated. KSP2's development was not as controversial as many online would have you believe, especially compared to more scandalous ones, but for me it is by far the most disappointed I've ever been with a video game.  KSP2 was announced in August of 2019 at Gamescon, slated to release in 2020 by Star Theory Games, formerly known as Uber Entertainment. Wikipedia states:  ""For various reasons, the release date was pushed back to Q3 2021.""  This is a really funny sentence to me in 2024, knowing that the early access (EA) release would not be coming until a year and a half after that date. During this time, Take-Two established a new studio under Private Division called Intercept Games, poaching a dozen employees from Star Theory, including creative director Nate Simpson and lead producer Nate Robinson. The game would continue a long string of announced delays with little communication and progress updates in between, foreshadowing what was to come. Finally, in October of 2022, an early access release date of February 24, 2023 was announced. The date was, for once, one Intercept Games would stick to. Along with this announcement came a road map of major features for future updates, which outlined the following: early access, science, colonies, interstellar, exploration, and multiplayer, to be release chronologically over an unrevealed timeline. The hype that had died down over the years was [mostly] restored, and Intercept Games had bitten off more than they could chew.  Before I get into the release, I want backtrack a bit and have everyone watch the Cinematic Announcement Trailer that was released 4 years ago:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_nj6wW6Gsc&  Who is responsible for this? It is by far the best game trailer I've ever seen. It EMBODIES what players love about Kerbal Space Program: the mystique of other worlds, the scale of space, the clumsiness of Kerbals, and the drive we have to succeed after failure. The latter two quite literally embody the Kerbal way, as anyone from KSP1 who has stranded their loyal astronauts on Duna or straight up murdered them on the launchpad can confirm. If you were involved in any way with this trailer, give yourself a huge pat on the back. It may very well be the only good thing Intercept Games ever accomplished.  Two weeks before the early access release, ESA held a preview event where content creators could play the game for a few hours. Many of these content creators recording themselves playing and something seemed, well, off. You can see it in their eyes and the way they talk about the game. The very framework which would support every roadmap feature was not built on solid ground.  Two weeks later, early access was released. I recall some buzzing in the discord in the days before release about the frame rate, but Intercept has a history of being proactive with the ban hammer and anyone who commented these things was swiftly removed. Forced positivity was the subterfuge they needed to convince themselves that what was about to release was worth a fraction of the resources that had supposedly been poured into it. To cut a long story short, release day was a complete and utter disaster. Performance was abymsal with many high end systems topping out at 15fps, crafts were generally wonky and not in the ""Kerbal"" way, anti-aliasing looked jagged, maneuver nodes were busted (if you could even manage to get to space in the first place), no reentry heating, and an unlimited number of other failures all reared their ugly faces. Even the tutorials themselves didn't feel like KSP. Wrap all those mistakes into a $50 price tag and it's not hard to see why KSP2's player count dipped below KSP1 within days of launch. I'm not going to pretend like I stuck it out and spent my time troubleshooting and reporting bugs to make the game better. I did what any sensible person would do and asked Steam for a refund.  The period that followed went as you would aspect: poor damage control. Intercept gaslighted their fan base and ruled with an iron first on their forums and Discord server. Nate occasionally posted updates on their forums, filled with so much technical jargon it made reading them a bigger chore than booting up the game itself. Other than that, there was a lot of radio silence. I encourage everyone to give this website a whirl, which displays the scale of our solar system if the Moon was only 1 pixel:  https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html  While you're scrolling, imagine each planet is an update given by Nate on the development of KSP2. The analogy works. Trust me.  In October of 2023, Nate gave a speech at Space Creator Day, in which he outlined some of KSP2's development problems before announcing the first roadmap update, For Science!, which ended up releasing in December of 2023. Performance had improved throughout 2023, and For Science! would give players objectives to work towards, but many of the release day issues remained unsolved, and many questions were still unanswered, like:  How could a planned release date of 2020 be delayed three years into a rushed EA release? Why did you double down on Unity knowing the same limitations would still be there? And ten thousand others you can scour the Internet for in your free time.  There is something really special about Kerbal Space Program. It feels unique, quirky, and most of the time, it just works. Games in this position are invaluable, and very hard to follow up with successful successors. Cities: Skylines 2 and Roller Coaster Tycoon World are more recent examples of games that, by and large, failed to recapture any of what made their predecessors unique. Even at its best, which it rarely ever was, KSP2 never felt like KSP1. Sid Meier once said his design philosophy for designing and creating his games is to ""play them, over and over, until they are fun."" It's clear that Meier's wisdom was never present in the development of KSP2, since it was never at any point any fun. Such is the early access fate, and shame on all of us for buying into it again. No lessons will be learned and will all be stewing in our anger in a few months at the next major letdown.  Kerbal Space Program 2 set its sights on the stars. Unfortunately, it sits abandoned at the launch site, having never even taken flight.  Take-Two ruins everything they get their hands on. F*** Take-Two."

133752712,english,1,954850,"If you played Kerbal Space Program BEFORE it went early access on Steam, then you will appreciate this game alot. It reminds me of build 0.9 alot. The performance and gameplay are very simliar to KSP1 in early development. The only drawback was I got KSP1 for free. I still paid for the steam version anyway, just to add it to my library. But if you want to be a part of this game's early development, here is your opportunity to do so.  PROS: good looking game. from the space ship skins, to the planetary ambiance with music for each planet to the rocket plumes and particles.  CONS: sandbox only, noodle rockets, no water effects, random glitches and wierd-happenings, trip planning is difficult.  Grain of salt: Buy it knowing this is the worst stage of development it is ever going to be in. Just enough to call a game engine, with a large upside for future upgrades."

188169131,english,0,954850,"Purchasing this game was probably the worse financial investment I've made in the past 5 years.  Less content than the KSP1 at the price of a AAA game. Development while not officially abandoned, has been abandoned.  Last update was June 11th 2025, it is currently 17 February 2025. Take-Two sold off their ""Private Division"" (the publisher). The purchaser? A private equity firm, Haveli Investments. Annapurna Interactive had all 25 of their employees resign on September of 2024. Apparently those employees intend to create a new company and take over the portfolio. This company doesn't even have a name yet.   Basically, this game lost traction, before anything can happen with this game entire companies must be created, staffed, and then they have to put this game on the list of games to be worked on.   You can essentially just google Kerbal Space Program 2 and find out very quickly that the Overwhelmingly Negative reviews are 100% valid, justified, and the customers who have been unfortunate enough to buy into this game were sold an intent to make a game, when there was no intent to actually produce the game and instead sold off as they bid adieu with a middle finger in our general direction."
137014265,english,0,954850,"Kerbal Space Program was the perfect example of why Early Access should have worked. KSP2 is the perfect example of why Early access doesn't work. Early access was meant to deploy a mostly functional product in order to get community feedback for final polishing. It has since been warped into a quick cash grab by people releasing barely functional games and hoping they can make the money BEFORE their product is any good.   KSP2 isn't an early access game. It's a company that got too full of itself charging you $50 for what should be a free open beta. Very little works properly: * The VAB is glitchy as heck. Symmetry is iffy, and the camera will randomly jump to another position when you're just trying to pan up or down a bit. * Electric Charge doesn't seem to be working / draining * I reentered sideways to get a feel for heat management. No reentry fire effects, no explosions, nothing. I just skidded through the air all the way down to parachute deployment... UNTIL * I reverted to launch and tried again. At about 60km the ship suddenly popped out of existence (no explosion that I could see / hear) and the flight log came up saying I reentered too fast and burned up.  I could go on and on, having experienced a week's worth of bugs in under 2 hours... the graphics are iffy, the performance is horrible even on my 3090 at 1920x1080, the physics feel off, the airplane SAS wobbles like a dog shaking off water, staging will sometimes do 2 stages with a single activation... basically stuff that should have been fixed ""barely out of alpha.""  I am SOOO disappointed with the devs for this. I was super excited for KSP2 after putting a bazillion hours into KSP1. I was willing to keep the game and endure some lack of content and a few funny bugs to support the developer and wait as they fixed the last bits. Not after seeing this atrocity. I am getting a refund... and now not only have they ruined my excitement... they have probably ensured that I will not re-buy their game (even after it's fixed) or support them in their other projects.  ...

I will also add that KSP 1 is a better game at present and unless KSP 2 is further developed it will be for the foreseeable future.

As of writing this, Colonies, Interstellar travel, Multiplayer are non-existent in the game and sue to the state of the development are false claims being used to sell the idea of a game that will never be complete. I cannot comment on the state of modding support but have gathered from the modding community it was not left in a good state of support.   Frankly given that this game was used by the parent company take2 interactive through the proxy company private division as a cash grab, it should be delisted as a scam, but at the very least, the store page should be updated to correctly display the current state of the game. Many of the features advertised would not be discovered on a normal runthrough for well over the accepted refund period of 2 hours.  The development of this game has been canceled indefinitely.

Hold fire and wait for future patches, KSP1, modded KSP1 both blow this out of the water at this point in time.

It’s like being a test-driver and there is a wreck without tires in front of you.  Ok, don’t buy it….don’t! simply don’t!   I did and they can keep my money. But do yourself a favour and wait at least another year.....  UPDATE:  did I expect major improvements with patch 1: no do I try to be fair and just try it, maybe motivated by a dev-response that the patch solves many issues:  sure, it would be rude to ignore it  an now? for me it's still a wreck, still massive staging/fuel issues, still disintegrating ships...and somewhat the performance seems worse. ( and yes even with a new save) do they just choose the CRM-path to solve their issues...would be sad"

I never got into KSP 1 but the tutorials in KSP 2 helped me understand the mechanics and concepts which i could then translate to KSP 1. Im having a blast in KSP 1 now due to KSP 2 so its not completely a waste.  I know this is early access but it's really really broken. Probably some execs pushed for this game's release. I dont think any dev with any shred of respect for their craft would release a passion project like this in it's current state. Execs need to get their heads out of their bum and let them finish in their pace. This can only hurt KSP in the long run and subsequently the devs. Execs just fire the workers and get moved to another project to milk."

I expected that KSP1 is the base starting point. I expected thermodynamics to be active.  Maybe in the future I can recommend, but as of today I do not recommend.   For context on the state of optimization my setup is:  Ryzen 5900X RTX 3080 12 GB 32 GB ram @ 3600 Mhz  For 1080p High  I get 60 FPS on launch pad(prior to launch) and roughly 20-30 FPS during the launch."

Or what if you wanted a new game, with multiplayer base building and exploration? Why do you keep asking because none of the promises at launch have been carried out (even after a whole year). Honestly after having owned and played ksp 1 since 2013 this is a terrible let down, but the mods will choose to go onto Instagram and post kerbals next to pride flags instead of working on the game to make us feel better about being fucked in the ass."
133512458,english,0,954850,"I have about 550 hours in KSP, it is a part of my inspiration for getting a mechanical engineering degree so obviously I had to get KSP 2. This game shows a lot of promise but at the moment it is completely unplayable. I've only attempted to do one mission so far, I decided to do the Jool 5 as a test to myself and the game since I would need a pretty complex craft so I will walk you through my experience.   Specs:  GPU: RTX3080 CPU: i9-10850k Monitor: 1440p 144hz Ram: 32GB   Firstly, they changed some things with how the VAB controls, all of which I've seen are objectively worse and incredibly frustrating. I don't know who complained about the VAB controls but it is complete garbage now. I still have no idea how to move up and down my rocket, It used to be Shift-scroll wheel, now it seems to be entirely random what I get to be focused on, might be a bug but please if this is intentional, give an option for legacy controls. Also no idea why they needed to over complicate the fairings, what they had before was fine. Placing struts seems to randomly lag the game, sometimes holding a single frame for so long I think it has crashed and then it comes back. Somehow worse than all that was the nonstop tutorial notifications that I thought I had said no to when I first started the game and there was no option I could find in the settings to turn them off.  On the launch pad I was getting 20fps even while meeting or exceeding the recommended system requirements. Worse than that though my rocket was flopping around like it was made of rubber. Adding on even more struts did not fix this issue either. Somehow when I launched however it managed to fly straight so idk what that was about.  Once in space the sound design and most graphics were pretty awesome, was getting about 50fps. Love the new navball and maneuver nodes, gives me all the information I am looking for right there. New exhaust cones are absolutely beautiful and have fantastic sound design. When I was decoupling my boosters or first stage they also seemed to stick to my craft for some reason but a quicksave and load fixed it so it was fine I guess. My main complaint is that if you zoom out to a medium distance your craft and all the planets look blurry, not sure if its the anti-aliasing or something, I tried messing with the settings, but it just looked bad, and considering the performance issues it was really confusing why it looked so awful. Looked great when you zoom in though.  Here's where the game goes from good, to great, to unplayable. I went for a gravity assist around the mun when I heard the new sound track for it and maybe it was just really good timing but the music started to swell and build as I was getting closer and closer on my fly by and burn to Jool.  Then I exited kerbin's SOI and was met with the star's sound track which was also very good. Then I entered Jools SOI and was met it's kinda of brassy jazzy sound track which fit perfectly. Then as I started my gravity capture assist with Tylo I heard yet ANOTHER new sound track and in that moment I was really excited because I realized that every single moon will have a new sound track me to listen to while I explore.  Then I tried undocking my lander and it flew off with an extra 300m/s of delta V for no reason. So I tried to reload the quicksave that I always make before I try to do things like that and It brought me back to the launch pad... This was extra confusing because as you may remember I had quick saved and quick loaded to unstick my stages when they wouldn't properly decouple. I had done that several times, and I religiously spam the f5 button after every maneuver and every action because I know these things happen all the time in KSP, you simply can not play the game with an iron man mindset.  So I go to manually load the save from the menu and sure enough there it is. But when I go to load it? Completely corrupted. My first flight, my first save completely unplayable. Everything else I could deal with, but I can't play the game if it's going to be completely filled to the brim with game breaking bugs AND not allow me to quick load after they happen.  Tl;dr Pros:  Great music, great sound design, looks pretty (sometimes) Cons: No features, significantly more buggy, laggy, awful VAB controls, horrible performance, pop-ups are constant and you can't get rid of them."
153939550,english,0,954850,It is insane that this game will sit with the Multiplayer tag for years....with absolutely no multiplayer.
138761194,english,1,954850,"I invested over 1500 hours in KSP1, and after playing 8 hours on KSP2 I can comfortably say it is worth investing in if you were a fan of the original. ""Investing"" is the appropriate term by the way; yes, there is more to do in the original at present, but if you're a fan who's in it for the long haul you might as well get it for a relative discount compared to full release pricing and play in the sandbox while they put together the full package.  There are numerous bugs that remain; in my last play session I had 1/3 XL landing legs pop off my Moho lander midway through deployment; the camera at launch initially points upside down till I toggle chase mode, and struts went through SRB's which makes separation tricky, but the core mechanics and trial/error that I loved in KSP1 are very much intact. Besides bug fixes/optimizations, the game very much needs a progression system to offer that sense of accomplishment from the original, so I was glad to read that the development team is focusing more of their energy on long-term progression; hopefully Science mode will be on its way soon as I think it could be exactly what the game needs.  To add to all this, I'm running it on a below-minimum machine: an Optiplex 3060 MT with a GTX 1650 for a GPU. The GPU is well below the minimum spec, and though I have to commit all setting to low and occasionally switch my resolution to 720p to stay around 30fps, it is definitely a playable experience if you're a dedicated fan. I've also noticed improvements on bugs and performance over the last couple patches, so I'm hopeful this will continue as patches carry on.  Overall, the game is far from ideal in its present state, but it is exactly what I expected from Early Access, and if you're as obsessed as I am with KSP1, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy playing around in the sequel; just watch out for the Kraken!"

I bought it as soon it was unlocked and was exited to play. I am absolutely appalled by the state of this game. I understand its in beta I understand it will be fixed later but how has our modern gaming industry got to the point where game developers are no longer paying for beta testers, instead relying on dedicated fans to spend $50 on a broken game to beta test for them. I want to like this game, i really do. I think it has a lot of potential to add a large amount of content over the original game but the problem is none of it works. I truthfully hate that the modern gaming industry has decided that selling a completely broken game and fixing it later has become the accepted norm now. Again, I recognize this is a beta release and bugs are expected. But when basic things such as capsule recovery does not work and your kerbals disappear into the ether that's just unacceptable. Despite years of delays this game is not even close to being anything close to being done. and while yes most of these problems will probably be fixed in future updates to the game, the main problem of a product being rushed to market in a clearly unfinished state can never be undone. Companies should not make their most dedicated fans pay for the honor of debugging their new games."

I am sick of these early access thinking they can charge 50 bucks for a very poor quality game.

If you'd like to support the developers, consider buying this at a discount, otherwise I would honestly still wait until there is more content in the game.  Old review:  You can build half a rocket that will wobble to orbit. If you manage to leave orbit, you will probably be unable to land anywhere because of other bugs, or your rocket will just randomly explode. Trajectory lines are bugged.

Its sad that big companies like Take-Two Interactive ruin games. KSP may be less popular than GTA or other big titles made by Take Two, but that is no excuse for just abandoning the game. KSP has a community, a community which had hopes to get a better, more extensive KSP. These hopes were crushed by some corporate people who dont really care about the game.  They care about one thing, and one thing only: Money.  For them, a video game is only a product, like a pack of pasta in the supermarket. Of course, a company wants to make profit, but they forgot one thing. Us, the gamers, the people who buy their products. For us, KSP isnt just a product, for us it's something special and for some of us it may be even a passion.

146141154,english,0,954850,"AVOID! DO NOT BUY! THE DEV TEAM WAS LAID OFF AND DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CONTINUING.  Let's just do a little timeline of events:  2017/18 - Development must have started 2019 - Cinematic Release Trailer posted, promising a 2020 Full Release (I must stress this, it was to be a fully released game in 2020) 2020 - Delayed to 2021 (Fair enough covid was a pain) 2021 - Delayed to FY22  2022 - Announced for 2023 as Early Access 2023 (Feb) - Released as EA for full Price. 2023 (Dec) - First Update on Roadmap after months without any updates. 2024 (Apr) - Dev Studio Laid Off after under performing and failing to meet T2's rather reasonable expectations after 6-8yrs.  What we were advertised initially was a Full Game to be released in 2020. What we got was not even a 6th of the game, 3 years late (5-6yrs in development), in an Early Access state, paid for at a the price of Fully Released Triple A games, more than the price of KSP1 plus both DLC packs, but coming with less features than KSP1.  The current state of the game is similar to KSP1 v0.19 back in 2013, when KSP1 was $23 and receiving updates almost every month. Mean whilst KSP2 has been out for now 7 months and has received 3 updates and 2 hot fixes, which have not added any features.  The worst thing about this game is what it did to my motivation to play the origional, I stopped playing KSP1 as much with the announcement of KSP2s eventual release date as i was looking forward to playing what I, and I think most people also, expected to essentially be KSP1 as it was but with better graphics, sound design, and a better (both in accuracy and performance) physics engine. But no, what was released has questionable graphics (some better some worse), and uses the exact same physics engine with the exact same bugs that were in KSP1 but were dealt with by fixes and features that are missing from the current game (despite being promised by the devs, that features such as Autostrut, would be present at launch, to the Content Creators when told about how critical it was at a content creator event in advance of the launch.)  You'll notice I missed out any comments on the sound design, thats because it is the one thing that has been done categorically better than KSP1 without fail, the guys doing sound design at IG are awesome and honestly wasting there talents on KSP2. Would be far better to have a Paid DLC for KSP1 porting over that sounb design for engines and music.  TL;DR Don't buy if you love and still play KSP1. It will ruin your motivation to play a game you love. P.S. IG, please, go do a music and SFX DLC for KSP1, I will give you money."

As of writing this, Colonies, Interstellar travel, Multiplayer are non-existent in the game and sue to the state of the development are false claims being used to sell the idea of a game that will never be complete. I cannot comment on the state of modding support but have gathered from the modding community it was not left in a good state of support.   Frankly given that this game was used by the parent company take2 interactive through the proxy company private division as a cash grab, it should be delisted as a scam, but at the very least, the store page should be updated to correctly  display the current state of the game.

At the same time, according to public information, the development team was sold by the publisher, and the last update was released more than six months ago. In this case, the sale of the game is an exceptional fraud. I am sure that the publisher must be responsible for fraudulent actions. I really hope that the steam team will be able to take the necessary actions to protect the interests of their clients.

Intrigued, I played the demo all night, and bought version 0.18 the next day, and it has been my favorite video game ever since.  It would be another year before it was available on Steam.    Fast forward to February 24, 2023, and I bought the long anticipated sequel on launch day for full price.  I was proud to do so, and it is the single biggest mistake I have ever made on Steam.

156148994,english,0,954850,"I loved the original KSP, and got a lot of decent time in with this one. I think I'll probably sink a few hundred hours in. I love space games and Newtonian physicals models. I also have a high tolerance for early access games. I don't think the typical user will enjoy playing this yet, so I can't recommend it. I hope that changes, but it's hard to understand such a large step back.  I don't want to just negatively review and move on. Devs, I hope the following can be helpful and that the points I raise are constructive. Since this is an alpha, consider this the results of my alpha testing. This list is non-exhaustive. I have actually run out of space in the review.  Ranked vaguely in order of most annoying:  - Parachutes have a 25%ish chance to fail to deploy. This has nothing to do with any mechanic. If you revert the save, they might work this time. Or they might not.  - Attempting to edit a maneuver node, and the process of intercepting, is extremely frustrating. There are so many layers to this issue, from bugs to opinionated design choices, to farthest-from-optimal action flow.  - The game simply will not allow you to use the marker system if you are out of fuel. It will also not allow you to expand markers past where you would run out of fuel. The issue is, it's only counting the fuel in your current stage. Got leftover fuel in a stage you want to use? Ditch it. It's not worth losing the ability to plot your next course. lol. This is one of the most annoying things in this game, and it's an intended feature, not a bug. If you can't make it to your destination on one stage, you're going to have to burn halfway, and hope you eyeballed it well enough that your next stage isn't going to have to throw away a crapload of fuel fixing your imprecision.   - You cannot create or modify a course marker while the game is paused. Again, this is a feature and not a bug for some reason.   Aside: NASA has all their maneuvers calculated months before the launch. It gets programmed into a computer;the engineers sit back and drink coffee while the telemetry comes in. You can use an Orrery to see where celestial bodies will be years and years from now. You're really not going to let me take a two-minute timeout to ad-hoc my next step in the process of getting to another planet? I need momentum to even plot my first course, which means I can't take a first swing at figuring out what my plan is until I have an orbit. I've thought about using a dummy payload in orbit of kerbin to plot a course before I launch, but that would mean doing it all twice with the horrible course plotting experience, and the dummy payload would need a stupid amount of deltaV just to let me use the marker system to plan a route anywhere interesting.  - toggling timewarp too quickly will cause the game to lose track of its state. IE, the game will report time is paused while time is actually at 1-4x speed. This issue compounds the previously mentioned ""feature"" where you can't plot courses while ""paused,"" or even modify the thrust you have set. It's great hurling towards a planet at high speed, essentially shaking the soda machine in a panic trying to get it back into the working condition.  - Any ships you have in a given sphere of influence will supersede it on the minimap, and you cannot target or focus the celestial body without a really annoying 10+ second scroll session or 10ish clicks. You literally have to press your face against the planet to target it. Devs, you can assume that if I am looking at the star map from location A, controlling a vehicle there, that I do not want information about vehicles at location B. My camera is literally a billion kilometres away from those guys. If I want to see them, I can scroll in. It's infinitely more likely that I want to click on the planet, so I that I can plot a course to it. Just don't show the markers for these other ships unless my camera is at their perspective. (IE, ship in low Duna orbit should not be visible [much less overriding its parent body] from interstellar distances the camera views the Kerbol System from.  - minimap elements become distorted and overlap other elements of the map  - inconsistent course markers on the map view showing jittery distances despite an unobstructed course, making it impossible to accurately plot.  - it is very difficult to plot small changes >3 delta V. You are better off guessing and checking with an engine set to 1% thrust limiter, fishing for the course that will reduce your apogee manually. This is inefficient and time consuming, and it would be great to have the game do a little more to help you when you need a precise course change.  - Game will incorrectly report your current deltaV, or overall deltaV, on a variety of different screens and interfaces.   - Course information will sometimes jitter, and the game will report your perigee over a range of several kilometers. I see it most on a course from one planet to another, This makes it impossible to reliably set a course to aerobrake.  - Rotating parts in the VAB using WASDQE sometimes makes them unplacable on snap points.  - Staging often requires two clicks or spacebar presses, leading to a profound sense of dread wondering if this is the one where your rocket snaps in half and disintegrates because you staged twice.  - My last rocket was fairly excessive, but I was trying to get a payload of three vessels to Juul. It had 33 engines firing on the first stage, all small - medium parts, since that's where I was in the career mode. It might have been a stretch doing so much at once, but the game lets me, and it gave me the mission to get there knowing my constraints. Anyway, staging 12 SRBs at a time, my game would drop to 0 fps for 5-10 seconds. Literally no information from the display except whatever still image it landed on. Then, eventually, time would resume and the boosters begin to fall away.  - Debris sometimes becomes stuck midair above the space center only a few km in the air. I believe I have hit this derbies several times, but it's hard to tell with the lag happening up there, The debris sits at the altitude where I do my first/second stage. I think the game just gives up on the physics for spent fuel tanks.    - No way to filter debris off the map besides manually destroying each piece you leave behind at the tracking station.  - Test a fairing on the pad before you rely on it to release the payload. Trust me. The system is not very intuitive, and you cannot imagine my saddness watching a still-fully-encapsulated probe drifting away from my ship, and having no way whatsoever to release it.  - You will sometimes be unable to move or maneuver a ship that should be fully controllable, forcing a restart of the game  - My game has only ever alt-tabbed without crashing once. This is not an exaggeration.  - Ultrawide and 4k resolutions not supported natively  - Parts have no associated monetary cost, making the objectives in career mode feel a little bit lackluster. I can get anywhere if you let me use as many parts as I want. I'd recommend giving the user a money slider from infinite to soviet in order to add a layer of difficulty tailored to the individual's preferences  Summary: The bugs combine to make an incredibly frustrating experience. Bugs and game design choices amplify each other.  Career mode is cooler than KSP1. Lots of potential in the game. Just really a lot of technical debt to get through, and obviously since the game is feature incomplete, it will continue to be unstable for some time into the future. I think the devs can one day succeed at making Kerbal more accessible. I'm having a lot more fun playing campaign so far. I think the story they're putting together is cute, and they did a great job capturing the character of the original game. There are some great QOL improvements, like the ability to quickly set a course via button press, speed up time to markers, and plenty more. Hoping for good things."
133806368,english,0,954850,"As of its current state - I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING NOR PLAYING THIS GAME.  The fact that this even was considered to being released ignoring that abuse of Early Access does not justify the price tag and chaotic state of which this game is currently at.  Can we please stop treating Early Access as a term for Developers ramping up the Price and not caring a bit about if the game is actually you know functional.  This game promised a lot back in 2020 - and even promised to be released years earlier - and yet we're in 2023, with almost none of the features as well as missing the most basic of features from the first game.  I honestly cannot tell at this point if this game was even in development back when they said they were planning to release of if they simply kept redrawing their entire game without actually developing ontop of what they had.  This game is a joke of the first game as well as a mockery of Early Access Titles - honestly if the game isn't ready and needs beta testing do not post it as an premium ""early access"" when we're just paying to be a beta tester.   I'm extremely disappointed with the developers and with the fanbase who let this happen with not just this game but also with many other titles that abuse and misuse the term Early Access as Beta Channel.  EDIT: With the recent patch I'm more hopeful than before that KSP 2 might actually end up as a good game -  I also don't ignore the fact that KSP 1 was very different when it first released but due to the lack of attention and the lack of comparison there was no fallout. Where as this time there's an entire game to compare this too as well as a large audience.   I support the developers in actually helping to create this game, especially with their public outreach and support it brings me a lot of hope - what I'm annoyed about however is the publishers disconnect with the pricing and the understanding of what people are expecting from a £50 game.  As a Early Access buyer I hope that us forking up £50 for a game that's worth £10 or less should be rewarded in the future with some sort of special expansion or something at least to justify even being an EA user.  Publishers need to actually respect and understand the developers because if the developers aren't allowed to change the price to match the game public fallout will cost a lot more in the short and long term than any discounts would."

The fact that the developers of KSP 2 charged for the game and then walked away from development without releasing a full version is rotten. When KSP 2 was first advertised I could already tell that the developers were over promising. However, I didn't think they would fall as short as they have. I'd sure like a refund."

Love it. I do not recommend KSP2 Early Access in it's current state.  Why this early access is important: This is not the same team or company that made KSP1. The KSP IP was bought by Private Division and is now owned by Take Two Interactive. Private Division has asked Take Two for more funding to develop the game. Take Two denied it. The result is Private Division releasing this minimum viable product sold at premium price to cover ongoing development costs.  What this means: Do not defend this under the idea that KSP1 became a smash hit, it shares nothing with it. Do not assume anything positive or negative about the capability of the team to succeed or fail. Do not assume that Take Two will treat this any differently than any of it's other licensed titles.  This is a net-new initiative, treat it like it is. You are paying $50 for an Early Access. You are buying a promise from a new team run by a large detached corporation. There are concerns.  I will update my recommendation once it feels beneficial, but at this time I do not recommend it. Their are prolific game breaking bugs, very minimal content, and frustrating mechanics. While $50 may not be a big deal, funding this type of practice should be a consideration and what you expect from your money. Spend as you will."

176716187,english,0,954850,"It's now mid October of 2024. No updates in sight and knowing what happened with the studio that was developing this game, I think it's pretty safe to say that Kerbal Space Program 2 is officially 6 feet under.  I love KSP. The first game is one of my favorite games of all time, and I've spent many an hour screwing around with rocketry, blowing things up and learning along the way. I love space, I love space travel, and I love science, so in many ways KSP was an ideal game for me. That's why, as a huge fan of the original, it really does hurt to have seen the much-anticipated sequel be dragged through the mud, taken to the backyard and have a shotgun pressed against the back of its head. It sucks. Corporations really do ruin everything.  My advice to anybody who may read this, if indeed there are still people out there looking at this game, don't buy it. The game is done. If you want to play KSP, buy the first game. It doesn't get updated anymore, but it's still one of the most enjoyable experiences in gaming, whether you want to do things properly or just want to watch some fuel tanks explode (and 'accidentally' kill a bunch of astronauts while you're at it). The first game has a wonderful modding community with some of the most dedicated and talented modders I've personally ever seen outside of games like Skyrim or Minecraft. Essentially, the first game can be everything the second was meant to be, minus all of the bugs, crappy UI, astronomically high (pun not intended) system requirements, and broken dreams, of course.  As for KSP 2, well, I hate to say it, but this game belongs in the trash heap. I wouldn't say it's solely the developers' fault, but also Take Two for burning the studio down and, unfortunately, ruining what could have been a great game. Another lesson to remember, never pre-order games, especially not AAA ones."

178208145,english,0,954850,"""Kerbal Space Program 2"" is, without exaggeration, a monumental failure, a masterclass in how to ruin a beloved franchise, and an insult to anyone who trusted this development team with a sliver of hope. This so-called sequel is a sick joke—a buggy, broken, and utterly hollow disaster that doesn’t even deserve to be associated with the original *KSP*. The result is a toxic mix of empty promises, neglected fundamentals, and cynical greed.  First off, the performance issues are so shockingly severe that it’s a miracle the game even boots up. Calling it ‘poorly optimized’ would be generous; *KSP 2* feels like it was cobbled together by amateurs. It turns your PC into a glorified space heater, struggling under the weight of shoddy code that produces frame rates straight out of the Stone Age. It’s infuriating to play even the simplest missions when everything lags, crashes, and stalls as if the game is actively sabotaging you. How the developers let this heap of trash pass as a “finished” product defies logic.  The physics—the one aspect they absolutely could not afford to mess up—is a nonsensical mess. Rockets behave in absurd ways, randomly losing stability, ignoring logic, and self-destructing as if the game engine is being held together with chewing gum and hope. The once-satisfying challenge of engineering space missions has been turned into a tedious exercise in fighting against the broken mechanics of a game that’s forgotten what made it special. Calling this a ‘simulation’ of anything other than a money grab is laughable.  As for content, there’s practically nothing here. Where are the colonies? The promised interstellar travel? The new features that justified making a sequel in the first place? The game is a barren wasteland, barely distinguishable from the original, but with far fewer features and countless times the aggravation. The developers had years to build upon the foundation of *KSP*, but instead, they’ve delivered a stripped-down, soulless husk. It feels like they stopped developing halfway through and figured fans would be too blinded by nostalgia to notice.  And then there’s the utter disregard for the community. The developers’ silence is a slap in the face, demonstrating a level of disrespect that would be shocking if it weren’t so infuriating. It’s as though they thought they could cash in on the *KSP* brand name and quietly hope players wouldn’t notice the disaster they’d created. Updates are rare and ineffective, and when they do come, they barely scratch the surface of the game’s mountain of issues. It’s a blatant, greedy cash grab, with zero care for the quality or integrity of the product they’re selling.  ""Kerbal Space Program 2"" isn’t just a failure—it’s an abomination. It’s a scam dressed up in a familiar title, hoping to squeeze money out of loyal fans before they realize they’ve been duped. Stay away from this unholy wreck of a game. If you buy *KSP 2*, you’re not just wasting your money; you’re rewarding laziness, incompetence, and a complete betrayal of what *Kerbal Space Program* once stood for."

133783748,english,0,954850,"This is what happens when an incompetent development studio meets a greedy publisher.  This game was supposed to be released in 2020, as development began in 2017. We are getting a glorified tech demo in 2023 after multiple delayed release dates.   Yes, the game was likely pushed by the publisher and launched too early but who could blame them? They can't just keep throwing money and time at a development studio that obviously can't produce the game. The Q1 2023 release date was announced during a TakeTwo earnings call over a year ago, so don’t act like the devs haven’t had a YEAR to produce a stable release.  This game is not even remotely worth the price they are charging. Without going any further, $50 for an early access title is pushing it, $50 for this early access build of KSP2 is inexcusable. I can’t believe anyone involved with this game is happy asking people to spend $50 of their hard earned money for this, which they are because this “early access” title is being actively advertised.  The tech demo itself is a worse performing version of KSP1 with the most basic of parts, and no new features worth mentioning if you’re a fan of KSP1. The game is horribly optimized, the physics engine barely functions, the Kraken is worse than ever. By this point I am sure you’ve heard already the state of the demo if you’ve read this far. This could all be excused if the year was 2020 and they only charged $25-30, but again they are charging hard working people $50 to beta test their tech demo 3 years after the planned release date. To the “actually the game is discounted right now due to early access”, sorry but the $10 discount means nothing when they haven’t provided even provided 10% of what was supposed to be released years ago. I think early access is a great program and has produced some of my favorite games, but this is hardly ready to be put out.  No, I am not going to pay essentially full price now in anticipation of further development from the devs. That is not the purpose of the early access program. Rule 2 from Steam’s early access overview states that:  “2. Do not make specific promises about future events. For example, there is no way you can know exactly when the game will be finished, that the game will be finished, or that planned future additions will definitely happen. Do not ask your customers to bet on the future of your game. Customers should be buying your game based on its current state, not on promises of a future that may or may not be realized.” (Read the above rule again if you need to)   The devs have stated themselves on Steam:  “The 1.0 version of KSP 2 will include significantly more features than the Early Access version, such as what you see on the roadmap plus other items added along the way. This includes: · More parts and the opportunity for more creative builds · More star systems and hidden anomalies · Improved quality of life and onboarding to open up the vast beauty of space to even more players · Continued performance improvements and visual updates We can’t wait for you to join us on this journey into the stars!”  Based on the devs verbiage above, how are they not asking me to bet on the future of the game? They are asking me to pay $50 and hope they implement their planned roadmap when haven’t even proved they can make a functioning game. They can’t even release the most basic version of the game possible that isn’t objectively terrible after YEARS of development. Y'all are saying that you'd happily spend $50 for the game as is?  Anyone who worked on this game does not deserve a dime from the consumer. If that means KSP2 is cancelled then it is for the best. This release is a shameless cash grab by a publisher who needs to recoup costs from an incompetent development studio that has wasted years of production. I never thought these predatory business practices could happen to a franchise that has so much passion, from fans and the great people who worked on KSP1."

At this point, Take Two should just sell this IP for whoever would actually do a KSP 3 on a new engine like Godot properly, with a focus on mod extensibility and engine performance rather than promise and fail to deliver on scope creep.

Don't even try to use Early Access as excuse, all the features are gone, its a buggy mess and we been teased for years for a worthy successor of KSP. Just delete the whole project and port KSP to the new engine and fix the memory leaks.

If my child's development was as poor as KSP2's development, I would have drowned her in a lake."
164409609,english,0,954850,"With today's announcement that Take-Two has laid off the entirety of Intercept Games (confirmed per Bloomberg), I'll finally write my review, which is something I had held off doing until my last drop of hope evaporated. KSP2's development was not as controversial as many online would have you believe, especially compared to more scandalous ones, but for me it is by far the most disappointed I've ever been with a video game.  KSP2 was announced in August of 2019 at Gamescon, slated to release in 2020 by Star Theory Games, formerly known as Uber Entertainment. Wikipedia states:  ""For various reasons, the release date was pushed back to Q3 2021.""  This is a really funny sentence to me in 2024, knowing that the early access (EA) release would not be coming until a year and a half after that date. During this time, Take-Two established a new studio under Private Division called Intercept Games, poaching a dozen employees from Star Theory, including creative director Nate Simpson and lead producer Nate Robinson. The game would continue a long string of announced delays with little communication and progress updates in between, foreshadowing what was to come. Finally, in October of 2022, an early access release date of February 24, 2023 was announced. The date was, for once, one Intercept Games would stick to. Along with this announcement came a road map of major features for future updates, which outlined the following: early access, science, colonies, interstellar, exploration, and multiplayer, to be release chronologically over an unrevealed timeline. The hype that had died down over the years was [mostly] restored, and Intercept Games had bitten off more than they could chew.  Before I get into the release, I want backtrack a bit and have everyone watch the Cinematic Announcement Trailer that was released 4 years ago:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_nj6wW6Gsc&  Who is responsible for this? It is by far the best game trailer I've ever seen. It EMBODIES what players love about Kerbal Space Program: the mystique of other worlds, the scale of space, the clumsiness of Kerbals, and the drive we have to succeed after failure. The latter two quite literally embody the Kerbal way, as anyone from KSP1 who has stranded their loyal astronauts on Duna or straight up murdered them on the launchpad can confirm. If you were involved in any way with this trailer, give yourself a huge pat on the back. It may very well be the only good thing Intercept Games ever accomplished.  Two weeks before the early access release, ESA held a preview event where content creators could play the game for a few hours. Many of these content creators recording themselves playing and something seemed, well, off. You can see it in their eyes and the way they talk about the game. The very framework which would support every roadmap feature was not built on solid ground.  Two weeks later, early access was released. I recall some buzzing in the discord in the days before release about the frame rate, but Intercept has a history of being proactive with the ban hammer and anyone who commented these things was swiftly removed. Forced positivity was the subterfuge they needed to convince themselves that what was about to release was worth a fraction of the resources that had supposedly been poured into it. To cut a long story short, release day was a complete and utter disaster. Performance was abymsal with many high end systems topping out at 15fps, crafts were generally wonky and not in the ""Kerbal"" way, anti-aliasing looked jagged, maneuver nodes were busted (if you could even manage to get to space in the first place), no reentry heating, and an unlimited number of other failures all reared their ugly faces. Even the tutorials themselves didn't feel like KSP. Wrap all those mistakes into a $50 price tag and it's not hard to see why KSP2's player count dipped below KSP1 within days of launch. I'm not going to pretend like I stuck it out and spent my time troubleshooting and reporting bugs to make the game better. I did what any sensible person would do and asked Steam for a refund.  The period that followed went as you would aspect: poor damage control. Intercept gaslighted their fan base and ruled with an iron first on their forums and Discord server. Nate occasionally posted updates on their forums, filled with so much technical jargon it made reading them a bigger chore than booting up the game itself. Other than that, there was a lot of radio silence. I encourage everyone to give this website a whirl, which displays the scale of our solar system if the Moon was only 1 pixel:  https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html  While you're scrolling, imagine each planet is an update given by Nate on the development of KSP2. The analogy works. Trust me.  In October of 2023, Nate gave a speech at Space Creator Day, in which he outlined some of KSP2's development problems before announcing the first roadmap update, For Science!, which ended up releasing in December of 2023. Performance had improved throughout 2023, and For Science! would give players objectives to work towards, but many of the release day issues remained unsolved, and many questions were still unanswered, like:  How could a planned release date of 2020 be delayed three years into a rushed EA release? Why did you double down on Unity knowing the same limitations would still be there? And ten thousand others you can scour the Internet for in your free time.  There is something really special about Kerbal Space Program. It feels unique, quirky, and most of the time, it just works. Games in this position are invaluable, and very hard to follow up with successful successors. Cities: Skylines 2 and Roller Coaster Tycoon World are more recent examples of games that, by and large, failed to recapture any of what made their predecessors unique. Even at its best, which it rarely ever was, KSP2 never felt like KSP1. Sid Meier once said his design philosophy for designing and creating his games is to ""play them, over and over, until they are fun."" It's clear that Meier's wisdom was never present in the development of KSP2, since it was never at any point any fun. Such is the early access fate, and shame on all of us for buying into it again. No lessons will be learned and will all be stewing in our anger in a few months at the next major letdown.  Kerbal Space Program 2 set its sights on the stars. Unfortunately, it sits abandoned at the launch site, having never even taken flight.  Take-Two ruins everything they get their hands on. F*** Take-Two."

Basically, this game lost traction, before anything can happen with this game entire companies must be created, staffed, and then they have to put this game on the list of games to be worked on.

It has since been warped into a quick cash grab by people releasing barely functional games and hoping they can make the money BEFORE their product is any good.   KSP2 isn't an early access game. It's a company that got too full of itself charging you $50 for what should be a free open beta. Very little works properly: * The VAB is glitchy as heck. Symmetry is iffy, and the camera will randomly jump to another position when you're just trying to pan up or down a bit. * Electric Charge doesn't seem to be working / draining * I reentered sideways to get a feel for heat management. No reentry fire effects, no explosions, nothing. I just skidded through the air all the way down to parachute deployment... UNTIL * I reverted to launch and tried again. At about 60km the ship suddenly popped out of existence (no explosion that I could see / hear) and the flight log came up saying I reentered too fast and burned up.  I could go on and on, having experienced a week's worth of bugs in under 2 hours... the graphics are iffy, the performance is horrible even on my 3090 at 1920x1080, the physics feel off, the airplane SAS wobbles like a dog shaking off water, staging will sometimes do 2 stages with a single activation... basically stuff that should have been fixed ""barely out of alpha.""  I am SOOO disappointed with the devs for this. I was super excited for KSP2 after putting a bazillion hours into KSP1. I was willing to keep the game and endure some lack of content and a few funny bugs to support the developer and wait as they fixed the last bits. Not after seeing this atrocity.

Focus seems to have been on making it look and sound pretty over ensuring the Early Access release works. * Basic functionality is missing. * Kraken has occurred much more frequently, multiple struts required on a rocket that shouldn't need any. * Stability control isn't as strong as previous game (barely functions). * Manoeuvre nodes bugged out making it look like I was in an exit trajectory during when trying to circularize. * Search doesn't list items you'd expect.  Hold fire and wait for future patches, KSP1, modded KSP1 both blow this out of the water at this point in time. The grounds for a good game are there... but this needed much more work before a public release. It's definitely not worth it's current price.  Overall, Disappointed but hopeful for the future."

It’s like being a test-driver and there is a wreck without tires in front of you.  Ok, don’t buy it….don’t! simply don’t!   I did and they can keep my money. But do yourself a favour and wait at least another year.....  UPDATE:  did I expect major improvements with patch 1: no do I try to be fair and just try it, maybe motivated by a dev-response that the patch solves many issues:  sure, it would be rude to ignore it  an now? for me it's still a wreck, still massive staging/fuel issues, still disintegrating ships...and somewhat the performance seems worse. ( and yes even with a new save) do they just choose the CRM-path to solve their issues...would be sad"

I never got into KSP 1 but the tutorials in KSP 2 helped me understand the mechanics and concepts which i could then translate to KSP 1. Im having a blast in KSP 1 now due to KSP 2 so its not completely a waste.  I know this is early access but it's really really broken. Probably some execs pushed for this game's release. I dont think any dev with any shred of respect for their craft would release a passion project like this in it's current state. Execs need to get their heads out of their bum and let them finish in their pace. This can only hurt KSP in the long run and subsequently the devs. Execs just fire the workers and get moved to another project to milk."

I expected that KSP1 is the base starting point. I expected thermodynamics to be active.  Maybe in the future I can recommend, but as of today I do not recommend.   For context on the state of optimization my setup is:  Ryzen 5900X RTX 3080 12 GB 32 GB ram @ 3600 Mhz  For 1080p High  I get 60 FPS on launch pad(prior to launch) and roughly 20-30 FPS during the launch."

133512458,english,0,954850,"I have about 550 hours in KSP, it is a part of my inspiration for getting a mechanical engineering degree so obviously I had to get KSP 2. This game shows a lot of promise but at the moment it is completely unplayable. I've only attempted to do one mission so far, I decided to do the Jool 5 as a test to myself and the game since I would need a pretty complex craft so I will walk you through my experience.   Specs:  GPU: RTX3080 CPU: i9-10850k Monitor: 1440p 144hz Ram: 32GB   Firstly, they changed some things with how the VAB controls, all of which I've seen are objectively worse and incredibly frustrating. I don't know who complained about the VAB controls but it is complete garbage now. I still have no idea how to move up and down my rocket, It used to be Shift-scroll wheel, now it seems to be entirely random what I get to be focused on, might be a bug but please if this is intentional, give an option for legacy controls. Also no idea why they needed to over complicate the fairings, what they had before was fine. Placing struts seems to randomly lag the game, sometimes holding a single frame for so long I think it has crashed and then it comes back. Somehow worse than all that was the nonstop tutorial notifications that I thought I had said no to when I first started the game and there was no option I could find in the settings to turn them off.  On the launch pad I was getting 20fps even while meeting or exceeding the recommended system requirements. Worse than that though my rocket was flopping around like it was made of rubber. Adding on even more struts did not fix this issue either. Somehow when I launched however it managed to fly straight so idk what that was about.  Once in space the sound design and most graphics were pretty awesome, was getting about 50fps. Love the new navball and maneuver nodes, gives me all the information I am looking for right there. New exhaust cones are absolutely beautiful and have fantastic sound design. When I was decoupling my boosters or first stage they also seemed to stick to my craft for some reason but a quicksave and load fixed it so it was fine I guess. My main complaint is that if you zoom out to a medium distance your craft and all the planets look blurry, not sure if its the anti-aliasing or something, I tried messing with the settings, but it just looked bad, and considering the performance issues it was really confusing why it looked so awful. Looked great when you zoom in though.  Here's where the game goes from good, to great, to unplayable. I went for a gravity assist around the mun when I heard the new sound track for it and maybe it was just really good timing but the music started to swell and build as I was getting closer and closer on my fly by and burn to Jool.  Then I exited kerbin's SOI and was met with the star's sound track which was also very good. Then I entered Jools SOI and was met it's kinda of brassy jazzy sound track which fit perfectly. Then as I started my gravity capture assist with Tylo I heard yet ANOTHER new sound track and in that moment I was really excited because I realized that every single moon will have a new sound track me to listen to while I explore.  Then I tried undocking my lander and it flew off with an extra 300m/s of delta V for no reason. So I tried to reload the quicksave that I always make before I try to do things like that and It brought me back to the launch pad... This was extra confusing because as you may remember I had quick saved and quick loaded to unstick my stages when they wouldn't properly decouple. I had done that several times, and I religiously spam the f5 button after every maneuver and every action because I know these things happen all the time in KSP, you simply can not play the game with an iron man mindset.  So I go to manually load the save from the menu and sure enough there it is. But when I go to load it? Completely corrupted. My first flight, my first save completely unplayable. Everything else I could deal with, but I can't play the game if it's going to be completely filled to the brim with game breaking bugs AND not allow me to quick load after they happen.  Tl;dr Pros:  Great music, great sound design, looks pretty (sometimes) Cons: No features, significantly more buggy, laggy, awful VAB controls, horrible performance, pop-ups are constant and you can't get rid of them."
153939550,english,0,954850,It is insane that this game will sit with the Multiplayer tag for years....with absolutely no multiplayer.
138761194,english,1,954850,"I invested over 1500 hours in KSP1, and after playing 8 hours on KSP2 I can comfortably say it is worth investing in if you were a fan of the original. ""Investing"" is the appropriate term by the way; yes, there is more to do in the original at present, but if you're a fan who's in it for the long haul you might as well get it for a relative discount compared to full release pricing and play in the sandbox while they put together the full package.  There are numerous bugs that remain; in my last play session I had 1/3 XL landing legs pop off my Moho lander midway through deployment; the camera at launch initially points upside down till I toggle chase mode, and struts went through SRB's which makes separation tricky, but the core mechanics and trial/error that I loved in KSP1 are very much intact. Besides bug fixes/optimizations, the game very much needs a progression system to offer that sense of accomplishment from the original, so I was glad to read that the development team is focusing more of their energy on long-term progression; hopefully Science mode will be on its way soon as I think it could be exactly what the game needs.  To add to all this, I'm running it on a below-minimum machine: an Optiplex 3060 MT with a GTX 1650 for a GPU. The GPU is well below the minimum spec, and though I have to commit all setting to low and occasionally switch my resolution to 720p to stay around 30fps, it is definitely a playable experience if you're a dedicated fan. I've also noticed improvements on bugs and performance over the last couple patches, so I'm hopeful this will continue as patches carry on.  Overall, the game is far from ideal in its present state, but it is exactly what I expected from Early Access, and if you're as obsessed as I am with KSP1, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy playing around in the sequel; just watch out for the Kraken!"
133548498,english,0,954850,"How has the modern gaming industry come to this. I have spend hundreds of hours in the first game and was counting the days until this game released. I bought it as soon it was unlocked and was exited to play. I am absolutely appalled by the state of this game. I understand its in beta I understand it will be fixed later but how has our modern gaming industry got to the point where game developers are no longer paying for beta testers, instead relying on dedicated fans to spend $50 on a broken game to beta test for them. I want to like this game, i really do. I think it has a lot of potential to add a large amount of content over the original game but the problem is none of it works. I truthfully hate that the modern gaming industry has decided that selling a completely broken game and fixing it later has become the accepted norm now. Again, I recognize this is a beta release and bugs are expected. But when basic things such as capsule recovery does not work and your kerbals disappear into the ether that's just unacceptable. Despite years of delays this game is not even close to being anything close to being done. and while yes most of these problems will probably be fixed in future updates to the game, the main problem of a product being rushed to market in a clearly unfinished state can never be undone. Companies should not make their most dedicated fans pay for the honor of debugging their new games."

I am sick of these early access thinking they can charge 50 bucks for a very poor quality game. I was fine with missing features as its what ever but no excuse for the cost vs crappy optimization where its frustrating playing the game.

If you'd like to support the developers, consider buying this at a discount, otherwise I would honestly still wait until there is more content in the game.  Old review:  You can build half a rocket that will wobble to orbit. If you manage to leave orbit, you will probably be unable to land anywhere because of other bugs, or your rocket will just randomly explode. Trajectory lines are bugged. Heat shielding is not needed as there is no heat in the game. No patch with anything new for 5 months despite everything being 'near completion'. Not worth the money at the moment.

We were again full of hopes, we were looking forward to the next updates. And then came the devastating message: Private Divsion was laid of.    Its sad that big companies like Take-Two Interactive ruin games. KSP may be less popular than GTA or other big titles made by Take Two, but that is no excuse for just abandoning the game. KSP has a community, a community which had hopes to get a better, more extensive KSP. These hopes were crushed by some corporate people who dont really care about the game.  They care about one thing, and one thing only: Money.  For them, a video game is only a product, like a pack of pasta in the supermarket. Of course, a company wants to make profit, but they forgot one thing. Us, the gamers, the people who buy their products. For us, KSP isnt just a product, for us it's something special and for some of us it may be even a passion.

What we were advertised initially was a Full Game to be released in 2020. What we got was not even a 6th of the game, 3 years late (5-6yrs in development), in an Early Access state, paid for at a the price of Fully Released Triple A games, more than the price of KSP1 plus both DLC packs, but coming with less features than KSP1.  The current state of the game is similar to KSP1 v0.19 back in 2013, when KSP1 was $23 and receiving updates almost every month. Mean whilst KSP2 has been out for now 7 months and has received 3 updates and 2 hot fixes, which have not added any features.  The worst thing about this game is what it did to my motivation to play the origional, I stopped playing KSP1 as much with the announcement of KSP2s eventual release date as i was looking forward to playing what I, and I think most people also, expected to essentially be KSP1 as it was but with better graphics, sound design, and a better (both in accuracy and performance) physics engine. But no, what was released has questionable graphics (some better some worse), and uses the exact same physics engine with the exact same bugs that were in KSP1 but were dealt with by fixes and features that are missing from the current game (despite being promised by the devs, that features such as Autostrut, would be present at launch, to the Content Creators when told about how critical it was at a content creator event in advance of the launch.)  You'll notice I missed out any comments on the sound design, thats because it is the one thing that has been done categorically better than KSP1 without fail, the guys doing sound design at IG are awesome and honestly wasting there talents on KSP2. Would be far better to have a Paid DLC for KSP1 porting over that sounb design for engines and music.  TL;DR Don't buy if you love and still play KSP1.

It was the launch date of North Korea's first successful rocket, and some people on reddit were joking that the DPRK engineers were learning a lot from playing KSP. Intrigued, I played the demo all night, and bought version 0.18 the next day, and it has been my favorite video game ever since.  It would be another year before it was available on Steam.    Fast forward to February 24, 2023, and I bought the long anticipated sequel on launch day for full price.  I was proud to do so, and it is the single biggest mistake I have ever made on Steam.  This is one of the biggest cons ever pulled on Steam, imo.  Everybody involved with KSP2 should be ashamed of themselves.  Please, please, please play and love the original."

156148994,english,0,954850,"I loved the original KSP, and got a lot of decent time in with this one. I think I'll probably sink a few hundred hours in. I love space games and Newtonian physicals models. I also have a high tolerance for early access games. I don't think the typical user will enjoy playing this yet, so I can't recommend it. I hope that changes, but it's hard to understand such a large step back.  I don't want to just negatively review and move on. Devs, I hope the following can be helpful and that the points I raise are constructive. Since this is an alpha, consider this the results of my alpha testing. This list is non-exhaustive. I have actually run out of space in the review.  Ranked vaguely in order of most annoying:  - Parachutes have a 25%ish chance to fail to deploy. This has nothing to do with any mechanic. If you revert the save, they might work this time. Or they might not.  - Attempting to edit a maneuver node, and the process of intercepting, is extremely frustrating. There are so many layers to this issue, from bugs to opinionated design choices, to farthest-from-optimal action flow.  - The game simply will not allow you to use the marker system if you are out of fuel. It will also not allow you to expand markers past where you would run out of fuel. The issue is, it's only counting the fuel in your current stage. Got leftover fuel in a stage you want to use? Ditch it. It's not worth losing the ability to plot your next course. lol. This is one of the most annoying things in this game, and it's an intended feature, not a bug. If you can't make it to your destination on one stage, you're going to have to burn halfway, and hope you eyeballed it well enough that your next stage isn't going to have to throw away a crapload of fuel fixing your imprecision.   - You cannot create or modify a course marker while the game is paused. Again, this is a feature and not a bug for some reason.   Aside: NASA has all their maneuvers calculated months before the launch. It gets programmed into a computer;the engineers sit back and drink coffee while the telemetry comes in. You can use an Orrery to see where celestial bodies will be years and years from now. You're really not going to let me take a two-minute timeout to ad-hoc my next step in the process of getting to another planet? I need momentum to even plot my first course, which means I can't take a first swing at figuring out what my plan is until I have an orbit. I've thought about using a dummy payload in orbit of kerbin to plot a course before I launch, but that would mean doing it all twice with the horrible course plotting experience, and the dummy payload would need a stupid amount of deltaV just to let me use the marker system to plan a route anywhere interesting.  - toggling timewarp too quickly will cause the game to lose track of its state. IE, the game will report time is paused while time is actually at 1-4x speed. This issue compounds the previously mentioned ""feature"" where you can't plot courses while ""paused,"" or even modify the thrust you have set. It's great hurling towards a planet at high speed, essentially shaking the soda machine in a panic trying to get it back into the working condition.  - Any ships you have in a given sphere of influence will supersede it on the minimap, and you cannot target or focus the celestial body without a really annoying 10+ second scroll session or 10ish clicks. You literally have to press your face against the planet to target it. Devs, you can assume that if I am looking at the star map from location A, controlling a vehicle there, that I do not want information about vehicles at location B. My camera is literally a billion kilometres away from those guys. If I want to see them, I can scroll in. It's infinitely more likely that I want to click on the planet, so I that I can plot a course to it. Just don't show the markers for these other ships unless my camera is at their perspective. (IE, ship in low Duna orbit should not be visible [much less overriding its parent body] from interstellar distances the camera views the Kerbol System from.  - minimap elements become distorted and overlap other elements of the map  - inconsistent course markers on the map view showing jittery distances despite an unobstructed course, making it impossible to accurately plot.  - it is very difficult to plot small changes >3 delta V. You are better off guessing and checking with an engine set to 1% thrust limiter, fishing for the course that will reduce your apogee manually. This is inefficient and time consuming, and it would be great to have the game do a little more to help you when you need a precise course change.  - Game will incorrectly report your current deltaV, or overall deltaV, on a variety of different screens and interfaces.   - Course information will sometimes jitter, and the game will report your perigee over a range of several kilometers. I see it most on a course from one planet to another, This makes it impossible to reliably set a course to aerobrake.  - Rotating parts in the VAB using WASDQE sometimes makes them unplacable on snap points.  - Staging often requires two clicks or spacebar presses, leading to a profound sense of dread wondering if this is the one where your rocket snaps in half and disintegrates because you staged twice.  - My last rocket was fairly excessive, but I was trying to get a payload of three vessels to Juul. It had 33 engines firing on the first stage, all small - medium parts, since that's where I was in the career mode. It might have been a stretch doing so much at once, but the game lets me, and it gave me the mission to get there knowing my constraints. Anyway, staging 12 SRBs at a time, my game would drop to 0 fps for 5-10 seconds. Literally no information from the display except whatever still image it landed on. Then, eventually, time would resume and the boosters begin to fall away.  - Debris sometimes becomes stuck midair above the space center only a few km in the air. I believe I have hit this derbies several times, but it's hard to tell with the lag happening up there, The debris sits at the altitude where I do my first/second stage. I think the game just gives up on the physics for spent fuel tanks.    - No way to filter debris off the map besides manually destroying each piece you leave behind at the tracking station.  - Test a fairing on the pad before you rely on it to release the payload. Trust me. The system is not very intuitive, and you cannot imagine my saddness watching a still-fully-encapsulated probe drifting away from my ship, and having no way whatsoever to release it.  - You will sometimes be unable to move or maneuver a ship that should be fully controllable, forcing a restart of the game  - My game has only ever alt-tabbed without crashing once. This is not an exaggeration.  - Ultrawide and 4k resolutions not supported natively  - Parts have no associated monetary cost, making the objectives in career mode feel a little bit lackluster. I can get anywhere if you let me use as many parts as I want. I'd recommend giving the user a money slider from infinite to soviet in order to add a layer of difficulty tailored to the individual's preferences  Summary: The bugs combine to make an incredibly frustrating experience. Bugs and game design choices amplify each other.  Career mode is cooler than KSP1. Lots of potential in the game. Just really a lot of technical debt to get through, and obviously since the game is feature incomplete, it will continue to be unstable for some time into the future. I think the devs can one day succeed at making Kerbal more accessible. I'm having a lot more fun playing campaign so far. I think the story they're putting together is cute, and they did a great job capturing the character of the original game. There are some great QOL improvements, like the ability to quickly set a course via button press, speed up time to markers, and plenty more. Hoping for good things."
133806368,english,0,954850,"As of its current state - I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING NOR PLAYING THIS GAME.  The fact that this even was considered to being released ignoring that abuse of Early Access does not justify the price tag and chaotic state of which this game is currently at.  Can we please stop treating Early Access as a term for Developers ramping up the Price and not caring a bit about if the game is actually you know functional.  This game promised a lot back in 2020 - and even promised to be released years earlier - and yet we're in 2023, with almost none of the features as well as missing the most basic of features from the first game.  I honestly cannot tell at this point if this game was even in development back when they said they were planning to release of if they simply kept redrawing their entire game without actually developing ontop of what they had.  This game is a joke of the first game as well as a mockery of Early Access Titles - honestly if the game isn't ready and needs beta testing do not post it as an premium ""early access"" when we're just paying to be a beta tester.   I'm extremely disappointed with the developers and with the fanbase who let this happen with not just this game but also with many other titles that abuse and misuse the term Early Access as Beta Channel.  EDIT: With the recent patch I'm more hopeful than before that KSP 2 might actually end up as a good game -  I also don't ignore the fact that KSP 1 was very different when it first released but due to the lack of attention and the lack of comparison there was no fallout. Where as this time there's an entire game to compare this too as well as a large audience.   I support the developers in actually helping to create this game, especially with their public outreach and support it brings me a lot of hope - what I'm annoyed about however is the publishers disconnect with the pricing and the understanding of what people are expecting from a £50 game.  As a Early Access buyer I hope that us forking up £50 for a game that's worth £10 or less should be rewarded in the future with some sort of special expansion or something at least to justify even being an EA user.  Publishers need to actually respect and understand the developers because if the developers aren't allowed to change the price to match the game public fallout will cost a lot more in the short and long term than any discounts would."

Love it. I do not recommend KSP2 Early Access in it's current state.  Why this early access is important: This is not the same team or company that made KSP1. The KSP IP was bought by Private Division and is now owned by Take Two Interactive. Private Division has asked Take Two for more funding to develop the game. Take Two denied it. The result is Private Division releasing this minimum viable product sold at premium price to cover ongoing development costs.  What this means: Do not defend this under the idea that KSP1 became a smash hit, it shares nothing with it. Do not assume anything positive or negative about the capability of the team to succeed or fail. Do not assume that Take Two will treat this any differently than any of it's other licensed titles.  This is a net-new initiative, treat it like it is. You are paying $50 for an Early Access. You are buying a promise from a new team run by a large detached corporation. There are concerns.  I will update my recommendation once it feels beneficial, but at this time I do not recommend it. Their are prolific game breaking bugs, very minimal content, and frustrating mechanics. While $50 may not be a big deal, funding this type of practice should be a consideration and what you expect from your money. Spend as you will."

176716187,english,0,954850,"It's now mid October of 2024. No updates in sight and knowing what happened with the studio that was developing this game, I think it's pretty safe to say that Kerbal Space Program 2 is officially 6 feet under.  I love KSP. The first game is one of my favorite games of all time, and I've spent many an hour screwing around with rocketry, blowing things up and learning along the way. I love space, I love space travel, and I love science, so in many ways KSP was an ideal game for me. That's why, as a huge fan of the original, it really does hurt to have seen the much-anticipated sequel be dragged through the mud, taken to the backyard and have a shotgun pressed against the back of its head. It sucks. Corporations really do ruin everything.  My advice to anybody who may read this, if indeed there are still people out there looking at this game, don't buy it. The game is done. If you want to play KSP, buy the first game. It doesn't get updated anymore, but it's still one of the most enjoyable experiences in gaming, whether you want to do things properly or just want to watch some fuel tanks explode (and 'accidentally' kill a bunch of astronauts while you're at it). The first game has a wonderful modding community with some of the most dedicated and talented modders I've personally ever seen outside of games like Skyrim or Minecraft. Essentially, the first game can be everything the second was meant to be, minus all of the bugs, crappy UI, astronomically high (pun not intended) system requirements, and broken dreams, of course.  As for KSP 2, well, I hate to say it, but this game belongs in the trash heap. I wouldn't say it's solely the developers' fault, but also Take Two for burning the studio down and, unfortunately, ruining what could have been a great game. Another lesson to remember, never pre-order games, especially not AAA ones."

178208145,english,0,954850,"""Kerbal Space Program 2"" is, without exaggeration, a monumental failure, a masterclass in how to ruin a beloved franchise, and an insult to anyone who trusted this development team with a sliver of hope. This so-called sequel is a sick joke—a buggy, broken, and utterly hollow disaster that doesn’t even deserve to be associated with the original *KSP*. The result is a toxic mix of empty promises, neglected fundamentals, and cynical greed.  First off, the performance issues are so shockingly severe that it’s a miracle the game even boots up. Calling it ‘poorly optimized’ would be generous; *KSP 2* feels like it was cobbled together by amateurs. It turns your PC into a glorified space heater, struggling under the weight of shoddy code that produces frame rates straight out of the Stone Age. It’s infuriating to play even the simplest missions when everything lags, crashes, and stalls as if the game is actively sabotaging you. How the developers let this heap of trash pass as a “finished” product defies logic.  The physics—the one aspect they absolutely could not afford to mess up—is a nonsensical mess. Rockets behave in absurd ways, randomly losing stability, ignoring logic, and self-destructing as if the game engine is being held together with chewing gum and hope. The once-satisfying challenge of engineering space missions has been turned into a tedious exercise in fighting against the broken mechanics of a game that’s forgotten what made it special. Calling this a ‘simulation’ of anything other than a money grab is laughable.  As for content, there’s practically nothing here. Where are the colonies? The promised interstellar travel? The new features that justified making a sequel in the first place? The game is a barren wasteland, barely distinguishable from the original, but with far fewer features and countless times the aggravation. The developers had years to build upon the foundation of *KSP*, but instead, they’ve delivered a stripped-down, soulless husk. It feels like they stopped developing halfway through and figured fans would be too blinded by nostalgia to notice.  And then there’s the utter disregard for the community. The developers’ silence is a slap in the face, demonstrating a level of disrespect that would be shocking if it weren’t so infuriating. It’s as though they thought they could cash in on the *KSP* brand name and quietly hope players wouldn’t notice the disaster they’d created. Updates are rare and ineffective, and when they do come, they barely scratch the surface of the game’s mountain of issues. It’s a blatant, greedy cash grab, with zero care for the quality or integrity of the product they’re selling.  ""Kerbal Space Program 2"" isn’t just a failure—it’s an abomination. It’s a scam dressed up in a familiar title, hoping to squeeze money out of loyal fans before they realize they’ve been duped. Stay away from this unholy wreck of a game. If you buy *KSP 2*, you’re not just wasting your money; you’re rewarding laziness, incompetence, and a complete betrayal of what *Kerbal Space Program* once stood for."

133783748,english,0,954850,"This is what happens when an incompetent development studio meets a greedy publisher.  This game was supposed to be released in 2020, as development began in 2017. We are getting a glorified tech demo in 2023 after multiple delayed release dates.   Yes, the game was likely pushed by the publisher and launched too early but who could blame them? They can't just keep throwing money and time at a development studio that obviously can't produce the game. The Q1 2023 release date was announced during a TakeTwo earnings call over a year ago, so don’t act like the devs haven’t had a YEAR to produce a stable release.  This game is not even remotely worth the price they are charging. Without going any further, $50 for an early access title is pushing it, $50 for this early access build of KSP2 is inexcusable. I can’t believe anyone involved with this game is happy asking people to spend $50 of their hard earned money for this, which they are because this “early access” title is being actively advertised.  The tech demo itself is a worse performing version of KSP1 with the most basic of parts, and no new features worth mentioning if you’re a fan of KSP1. The game is horribly optimized, the physics engine barely functions, the Kraken is worse than ever. By this point I am sure you’ve heard already the state of the demo if you’ve read this far. This could all be excused if the year was 2020 and they only charged $25-30, but again they are charging hard working people $50 to beta test their tech demo 3 years after the planned release date. To the “actually the game is discounted right now due to early access”, sorry but the $10 discount means nothing when they haven’t provided even provided 10% of what was supposed to be released years ago. I think early access is a great program and has produced some of my favorite games, but this is hardly ready to be put out.  No, I am not going to pay essentially full price now in anticipation of further development from the devs. That is not the purpose of the early access program. Rule 2 from Steam’s early access overview states that:  “2. Do not make specific promises about future events. For example, there is no way you can know exactly when the game will be finished, that the game will be finished, or that planned future additions will definitely happen. Do not ask your customers to bet on the future of your game. Customers should be buying your game based on its current state, not on promises of a future that may or may not be realized.” (Read the above rule again if you need to)   The devs have stated themselves on Steam:  “The 1.0 version of KSP 2 will include significantly more features than the Early Access version, such as what you see on the roadmap plus other items added along the way. This includes: · More parts and the opportunity for more creative builds · More star systems and hidden anomalies · Improved quality of life and onboarding to open up the vast beauty of space to even more players · Continued performance improvements and visual updates We can’t wait for you to join us on this journey into the stars!”  Based on the devs verbiage above, how are they not asking me to bet on the future of the game? They are asking me to pay $50 and hope they implement their planned roadmap when haven’t even proved they can make a functioning game. They can’t even release the most basic version of the game possible that isn’t objectively terrible after YEARS of development. Y'all are saying that you'd happily spend $50 for the game as is?  Anyone who worked on this game does not deserve a dime from the consumer. If that means KSP2 is cancelled then it is for the best. This release is a shameless cash grab by a publisher who needs to recoup costs from an incompetent development studio that has wasted years of production.

KSP 1 is slowly being improved by the community all the time which is by far and away better than halted development.  At this point, Take Two should just sell this IP for whoever would actually do a KSP 3 on a new engine like Godot properly, with a focus on mod extensibility and engine performance rather than promise and fail to deliver on scope creep.

Don't even try to use Early Access as excuse, all the features are gone, its a buggy mess and we been teased for years for a worthy successor of KSP. Just delete the whole project and port KSP to the new engine and fix the memory leaks.

If my child's development was as poor as KSP2's development, I would have drowned her in a lake."
164409609,english,0,954850,"With today's announcement that Take-Two has laid off the entirety of Intercept Games (confirmed per Bloomberg), I'll finally write my review, which is something I had held off doing until my last drop of hope evaporated. KSP2's development was not as controversial as many online would have you believe, especially compared to more scandalous ones, but for me it is by far the most disappointed I've ever been with a video game.  KSP2 was announced in August of 2019 at Gamescon, slated to release in 2020 by Star Theory Games, formerly known as Uber Entertainment. Wikipedia states:  ""For various reasons, the release date was pushed back to Q3 2021.""  This is a really funny sentence to me in 2024, knowing that the early access (EA) release would not be coming until a year and a half after that date. During this time, Take-Two established a new studio under Private Division called Intercept Games, poaching a dozen employees from Star Theory, including creative director Nate Simpson and lead producer Nate Robinson. The game would continue a long string of announced delays with little communication and progress updates in between, foreshadowing what was to come. Finally, in October of 2022, an early access release date of February 24, 2023 was announced. The date was, for once, one Intercept Games would stick to. Along with this announcement came a road map of major features for future updates, which outlined the following: early access, science, colonies, interstellar, exploration, and multiplayer, to be release chronologically over an unrevealed timeline. The hype that had died down over the years was [mostly] restored, and Intercept Games had bitten off more than they could chew.  Before I get into the release, I want backtrack a bit and have everyone watch the Cinematic Announcement Trailer that was released 4 years ago:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_nj6wW6Gsc&  Who is responsible for this? It is by far the best game trailer I've ever seen. It EMBODIES what players love about Kerbal Space Program: the mystique of other worlds, the scale of space, the clumsiness of Kerbals, and the drive we have to succeed after failure. The latter two quite literally embody the Kerbal way, as anyone from KSP1 who has stranded their loyal astronauts on Duna or straight up murdered them on the launchpad can confirm. If you were involved in any way with this trailer, give yourself a huge pat on the back. It may very well be the only good thing Intercept Games ever accomplished.  Two weeks before the early access release, ESA held a preview event where content creators could play the game for a few hours. Many of these content creators recording themselves playing and something seemed, well, off. You can see it in their eyes and the way they talk about the game. The very framework which would support every roadmap feature was not built on solid ground.  Two weeks later, early access was released. I recall some buzzing in the discord in the days before release about the frame rate, but Intercept has a history of being proactive with the ban hammer and anyone who commented these things was swiftly removed. Forced positivity was the subterfuge they needed to convince themselves that what was about to release was worth a fraction of the resources that had supposedly been poured into it. To cut a long story short, release day was a complete and utter disaster. Performance was abymsal with many high end systems topping out at 15fps, crafts were generally wonky and not in the ""Kerbal"" way, anti-aliasing looked jagged, maneuver nodes were busted (if you could even manage to get to space in the first place), no reentry heating, and an unlimited number of other failures all reared their ugly faces. Even the tutorials themselves didn't feel like KSP. Wrap all those mistakes into a $50 price tag and it's not hard to see why KSP2's player count dipped below KSP1 within days of launch. I'm not going to pretend like I stuck it out and spent my time troubleshooting and reporting bugs to make the game better. I did what any sensible person would do and asked Steam for a refund.  The period that followed went as you would aspect: poor damage control. Intercept gaslighted their fan base and ruled with an iron first on their forums and Discord server. Nate occasionally posted updates on their forums, filled with so much technical jargon it made reading them a bigger chore than booting up the game itself. Other than that, there was a lot of radio silence. I encourage everyone to give this website a whirl, which displays the scale of our solar system if the Moon was only 1 pixel:  https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html  While you're scrolling, imagine each planet is an update given by Nate on the development of KSP2. The analogy works. Trust me.  In October of 2023, Nate gave a speech at Space Creator Day, in which he outlined some of KSP2's development problems before announcing the first roadmap update, For Science!, which ended up releasing in December of 2023. Performance had improved throughout 2023, and For Science! would give players objectives to work towards, but many of the release day issues remained unsolved, and many questions were still unanswered, like:  How could a planned release date of 2020 be delayed three years into a rushed EA release? Why did you double down on Unity knowing the same limitations would still be there? And ten thousand others you can scour the Internet for in your free time.  There is something really special about Kerbal Space Program. It feels unique, quirky, and most of the time, it just works. Games in this position are invaluable, and very hard to follow up with successful successors. Cities: Skylines 2 and Roller Coaster Tycoon World are more recent examples of games that, by and large, failed to recapture any of what made their predecessors unique. Even at its best, which it rarely ever was, KSP2 never felt like KSP1. Sid Meier once said his design philosophy for designing and creating his games is to ""play them, over and over, until they are fun."" It's clear that Meier's wisdom was never present in the development of KSP2, since it was never at any point any fun. Such is the early access fate, and shame on all of us for buying into it again. No lessons will be learned and will all be stewing in our anger in a few months at the next major letdown.  Kerbal Space Program 2 set its sights on the stars. Unfortunately, it sits abandoned at the launch site, having never even taken flight.  Take-Two ruins everything they get their hands on. F*** Take-Two."

But if you want to be a part of this game's early development, here is your opportunity to do so.  PROS: good looking game. from the space ship skins, to the planetary ambiance with music for each planet to the rocket plumes and particles.  CONS: sandbox only, noodle rockets, no water effects, random glitches and wierd-happenings, trip planning is difficult.

Apparently those employees intend to create a new company and take over the portfolio. This company doesn't even have a name yet.   Basically, this game lost traction, before anything can happen with this game entire companies must be created, staffed, and then they have to put this game on the list of games to be worked on.   You can essentially just google Kerbal Space Program 2 and find out very quickly that the Overwhelmingly Negative reviews are 100% valid, justified, and the customers who have been unfortunate enough to buy into this game were sold an intent to make a game, when there was no intent to actually produce the game and instead sold off as they bid adieu with a middle finger in our general direction."
137014265,english,0,954850,"Kerbal Space Program was the perfect example of why Early Access should have worked. KSP2 is the perfect example of why Early access doesn't work. Early access was meant to deploy a mostly functional product in order to get community feedback for final polishing. It has since been warped into a quick cash grab by people releasing barely functional games and hoping they can make the money BEFORE their product is any good.   KSP2 isn't an early access game. It's a company that got too full of itself charging you $50 for what should be a free open beta. Very little works properly: * The VAB is glitchy as heck. Symmetry is iffy, and the camera will randomly jump to another position when you're just trying to pan up or down a bit. * Electric Charge doesn't seem to be working / draining * I reentered sideways to get a feel for heat management. No reentry fire effects, no explosions, nothing. I just skidded through the air all the way down to parachute deployment... UNTIL * I reverted to launch and tried again. At about 60km the ship suddenly popped out of existence (no explosion that I could see / hear) and the flight log came up saying I reentered too fast and burned up.  I could go on and on, having experienced a week's worth of bugs in under 2 hours... the graphics are iffy, the performance is horrible even on my 3090 at 1920x1080, the physics feel off, the airplane SAS wobbles like a dog shaking off water, staging will sometimes do 2 stages with a single activation... basically stuff that should have been fixed ""barely out of alpha.""  I am SOOO disappointed with the devs for this. I was super excited for KSP2 after putting a bazillion hours into KSP1. I was willing to keep the game and endure some lack of content and a few funny bugs to support the developer and wait as they fixed the last bits. Not after seeing this atrocity. I am getting a refund... and now not only have they ruined my excitement... they have probably ensured that I will not re-buy their game (even after it's fixed) or support them in their other projects.  ...

133512458,english,0,954850,"I have about 550 hours in KSP, it is a part of my inspiration for getting a mechanical engineering degree so obviously I had to get KSP 2. This game shows a lot of promise but at the moment it is completely unplayable. I've only attempted to do one mission so far, I decided to do the Jool 5 as a test to myself and the game since I would need a pretty complex craft so I will walk you through my experience.   Specs:  GPU: RTX3080 CPU: i9-10850k Monitor: 1440p 144hz Ram: 32GB   Firstly, they changed some things with how the VAB controls, all of which I've seen are objectively worse and incredibly frustrating. I don't know who complained about the VAB controls but it is complete garbage now. I still have no idea how to move up and down my rocket, It used to be Shift-scroll wheel, now it seems to be entirely random what I get to be focused on, might be a bug but please if this is intentional, give an option for legacy controls. Also no idea why they needed to over complicate the fairings, what they had before was fine. Placing struts seems to randomly lag the game, sometimes holding a single frame for so long I think it has crashed and then it comes back. Somehow worse than all that was the nonstop tutorial notifications that I thought I had said no to when I first started the game and there was no option I could find in the settings to turn them off.  On the launch pad I was getting 20fps even while meeting or exceeding the recommended system requirements. Worse than that though my rocket was flopping around like it was made of rubber. Adding on even more struts did not fix this issue either. Somehow when I launched however it managed to fly straight so idk what that was about.  Once in space the sound design and most graphics were pretty awesome, was getting about 50fps. Love the new navball and maneuver nodes, gives me all the information I am looking for right there. New exhaust cones are absolutely beautiful and have fantastic sound design. When I was decoupling my boosters or first stage they also seemed to stick to my craft for some reason but a quicksave and load fixed it so it was fine I guess. My main complaint is that if you zoom out to a medium distance your craft and all the planets look blurry, not sure if its the anti-aliasing or something, I tried messing with the settings, but it just looked bad, and considering the performance issues it was really confusing why it looked so awful. Looked great when you zoom in though.  Here's where the game goes from good, to great, to unplayable. I went for a gravity assist around the mun when I heard the new sound track for it and maybe it was just really good timing but the music started to swell and build as I was getting closer and closer on my fly by and burn to Jool.  Then I exited kerbin's SOI and was met with the star's sound track which was also very good. Then I entered Jools SOI and was met it's kinda of brassy jazzy sound track which fit perfectly. Then as I started my gravity capture assist with Tylo I heard yet ANOTHER new sound track and in that moment I was really excited because I realized that every single moon will have a new sound track me to listen to while I explore.  Then I tried undocking my lander and it flew off with an extra 300m/s of delta V for no reason. So I tried to reload the quicksave that I always make before I try to do things like that and It brought me back to the launch pad... This was extra confusing because as you may remember I had quick saved and quick loaded to unstick my stages when they wouldn't properly decouple. I had done that several times, and I religiously spam the f5 button after every maneuver and every action because I know these things happen all the time in KSP, you simply can not play the game with an iron man mindset.  So I go to manually load the save from the menu and sure enough there it is. But when I go to load it? Completely corrupted. My first flight, my first save completely unplayable. Everything else I could deal with, but I can't play the game if it's going to be completely filled to the brim with game breaking bugs AND not allow me to quick load after they happen.  Tl;dr Pros:  Great music, great sound design, looks pretty (sometimes) Cons: No features, significantly more buggy, laggy, awful VAB controls, horrible performance, pop-ups are constant and you can't get rid of them."
153939550,english,0,954850,It is insane that this game will sit with the Multiplayer tag for years....with absolutely no multiplayer.
138761194,english,1,954850,"I invested over 1500 hours in KSP1, and after playing 8 hours on KSP2 I can comfortably say it is worth investing in if you were a fan of the original. ""Investing"" is the appropriate term by the way; yes, there is more to do in the original at present, but if you're a fan who's in it for the long haul you might as well get it for a relative discount compared to full release pricing and play in the sandbox while they put together the full package.  There are numerous bugs that remain; in my last play session I had 1/3 XL landing legs pop off my Moho lander midway through deployment; the camera at launch initially points upside down till I toggle chase mode, and struts went through SRB's which makes separation tricky, but the core mechanics and trial/error that I loved in KSP1 are very much intact. Besides bug fixes/optimizations, the game very much needs a progression system to offer that sense of accomplishment from the original, so I was glad to read that the development team is focusing more of their energy on long-term progression; hopefully Science mode will be on its way soon as I think it could be exactly what the game needs.  To add to all this, I'm running it on a below-minimum machine: an Optiplex 3060 MT with a GTX 1650 for a GPU. The GPU is well below the minimum spec, and though I have to commit all setting to low and occasionally switch my resolution to 720p to stay around 30fps, it is definitely a playable experience if you're a dedicated fan. I've also noticed improvements on bugs and performance over the last couple patches, so I'm hopeful this will continue as patches carry on.  Overall, the game is far from ideal in its present state, but it is exactly what I expected from Early Access, and if you're as obsessed as I am with KSP1, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy playing around in the sequel; just watch out for the Kraken!"
133548498,english,0,954850,"How has the modern gaming industry come to this. I have spend hundreds of hours in the first game and was counting the days until this game released. I bought it as soon it was unlocked and was exited to play. I am absolutely appalled by the state of this game. I understand its in beta I understand it will be fixed later but how has our modern gaming industry got to the point where game developers are no longer paying for beta testers, instead relying on dedicated fans to spend $50 on a broken game to beta test for them. I want to like this game, i really do. I think it has a lot of potential to add a large amount of content over the original game but the problem is none of it works. I truthfully hate that the modern gaming industry has decided that selling a completely broken game and fixing it later has become the accepted norm now. Again, I recognize this is a beta release and bugs are expected. But when basic things such as capsule recovery does not work and your kerbals disappear into the ether that's just unacceptable. Despite years of delays this game is not even close to being anything close to being done. and while yes most of these problems will probably be fixed in future updates to the game, the main problem of a product being rushed to market in a clearly unfinished state can never be undone. Companies should not make their most dedicated fans pay for the honor of debugging their new games."
133550163,english,0,954850,"I do not suggest the game at this stage.   I cannot believe 3+ years in dev and the game runs poorly as it does. They cannot use the indie dev as an excuse anymore as its a bigger team with a publisher behind them.   I am running 3080 with 64 gigs of ram with a i9 11th gen CPU and when I built a small plane with 4 booster engines 4 small fuel tanks and 2 main fuel tanks for the main engine, and it lags like hell.   I am sick of these early access thinking they can charge 50 bucks for a very poor quality game. I was fine with missing features as its what ever but no excuse for the cost vs crappy optimization where its frustrating playing the game.   I do not get to even see the crashing or explosion very well as it jitters freezes, etc... during its crashing of the ship."

There are some fun things to find as well. I would still not really recommend the game in the current state over e.g. KSP1. If you'd like to support the developers, consider buying this at a discount, otherwise I would honestly still wait until there is more content in the game.  Old review:  You can build half a rocket that will wobble to orbit. If you manage to leave orbit, you will probably be unable to land anywhere because of other bugs, or your rocket will just randomly explode. Trajectory lines are bugged. Heat shielding is not needed as there is no heat in the game. No patch with anything new for 5 months despite everything being 'near completion'. Not worth the money at the moment. If I could refund I would. Wish the devs the best"

That is just a scam. And we didn't even think about the employees who lost their job.  But now to the game itself: We all bought it and we were upset because it was just extremely buggy and unpleasant to play. Then fixes came, the game improved and we all could enjoy it... more or less... The first major update came with ""For Science!"". We were again full of hopes, we were looking forward to the next updates. And then came the devastating message: Private Divsion was laid of.    Its sad that big companies like Take-Two Interactive ruin games. KSP may be less popular than GTA or other big titles made by Take Two, but that is no excuse for just abandoning the game. KSP has a community, a community which had hopes to get a better, more extensive KSP. These hopes were crushed by some corporate people who dont really care about the game.  They care about one thing, and one thing only: Money.  For them, a video game is only a product, like a pack of pasta in the supermarket. Of course, a company wants to make profit, but they forgot one thing. Us, the gamers, the people who buy their products. For us, KSP isnt just a product, for us it's something special and for some of us it may be even a passion.  It is sad that these passions can be crushed only because of some corporate idiots who only care about the money.

Let's just do a little timeline of events:  2017/18 - Development must have started 2019 - Cinematic Release Trailer posted, promising a 2020 Full Release (I must stress this, it was to be a fully released game in 2020) 2020 - Delayed to 2021 (Fair enough covid was a pain) 2021 - Delayed to FY22  2022 - Announced for 2023 as Early Access 2023 (Feb) - Released as EA for full Price. 2023 (Dec) - First Update on Roadmap after months without any updates. 2024 (Apr) - Dev Studio Laid Off after under performing and failing to meet T2's rather reasonable expectations after 6-8yrs.  What we were advertised initially was a Full Game to be released in 2020. What we got was not even a 6th of the game, 3 years late (5-6yrs in development), in an Early Access state, paid for at a the price of Fully Released Triple A games, more than the price of KSP1 plus both DLC packs, but coming with less features than KSP1.  The current state of the game is similar to KSP1 v0.19 back in 2013, when KSP1 was $23 and receiving updates almost every month. Mean whilst KSP2 has been out for now 7 months and has received 3 updates and 2 hot fixes, which have not added any features.  The worst thing about this game is what it did to my motivation to play the origional, I stopped playing KSP1 as much with the announcement of KSP2s eventual release date as i was looking forward to playing what I, and I think most people also, expected to essentially be KSP1 as it was but with better graphics, sound design, and a better (both in accuracy and performance) physics engine. But no, what was released has questionable graphics (some better some worse), and uses the exact same physics engine with the exact same bugs that were in KSP1 but were dealt with by fixes and features that are missing from the current game (despite being promised by the devs, that features such as Autostrut, would be present at launch, to the Content Creators when told about how critical it was at a content creator event in advance of the launch.)  You'll notice I missed out any comments on the sound design, thats because it is the one thing that has been done categorically better than KSP1 without fail, the guys doing sound design at IG are awesome and honestly wasting there talents on KSP2. Would be far better to have a Paid DLC for KSP1 porting over that sounb design for engines and music.  TL;DR Don't buy if you love and still play KSP1. It will ruin your motivation to play a game you love. P.S. IG, please, go do a music and SFX DLC for KSP1, I will give you money."

156148994,english,0,954850,"I loved the original KSP, and got a lot of decent time in with this one. I think I'll probably sink a few hundred hours in. I love space games and Newtonian physicals models. I also have a high tolerance for early access games. I don't think the typical user will enjoy playing this yet, so I can't recommend it. I hope that changes, but it's hard to understand such a large step back.  I don't want to just negatively review and move on. Devs, I hope the following can be helpful and that the points I raise are constructive. Since this is an alpha, consider this the results of my alpha testing. This list is non-exhaustive. I have actually run out of space in the review.  Ranked vaguely in order of most annoying:  - Parachutes have a 25%ish chance to fail to deploy. This has nothing to do with any mechanic. If you revert the save, they might work this time. Or they might not.  - Attempting to edit a maneuver node, and the process of intercepting, is extremely frustrating. There are so many layers to this issue, from bugs to opinionated design choices, to farthest-from-optimal action flow.  - The game simply will not allow you to use the marker system if you are out of fuel. It will also not allow you to expand markers past where you would run out of fuel. The issue is, it's only counting the fuel in your current stage. Got leftover fuel in a stage you want to use? Ditch it. It's not worth losing the ability to plot your next course. lol. This is one of the most annoying things in this game, and it's an intended feature, not a bug. If you can't make it to your destination on one stage, you're going to have to burn halfway, and hope you eyeballed it well enough that your next stage isn't going to have to throw away a crapload of fuel fixing your imprecision.   - You cannot create or modify a course marker while the game is paused. Again, this is a feature and not a bug for some reason.   Aside: NASA has all their maneuvers calculated months before the launch. It gets programmed into a computer;the engineers sit back and drink coffee while the telemetry comes in. You can use an Orrery to see where celestial bodies will be years and years from now. You're really not going to let me take a two-minute timeout to ad-hoc my next step in the process of getting to another planet? I need momentum to even plot my first course, which means I can't take a first swing at figuring out what my plan is until I have an orbit. I've thought about using a dummy payload in orbit of kerbin to plot a course before I launch, but that would mean doing it all twice with the horrible course plotting experience, and the dummy payload would need a stupid amount of deltaV just to let me use the marker system to plan a route anywhere interesting.  - toggling timewarp too quickly will cause the game to lose track of its state. IE, the game will report time is paused while time is actually at 1-4x speed. This issue compounds the previously mentioned ""feature"" where you can't plot courses while ""paused,"" or even modify the thrust you have set. It's great hurling towards a planet at high speed, essentially shaking the soda machine in a panic trying to get it back into the working condition.  - Any ships you have in a given sphere of influence will supersede it on the minimap, and you cannot target or focus the celestial body without a really annoying 10+ second scroll session or 10ish clicks. You literally have to press your face against the planet to target it. Devs, you can assume that if I am looking at the star map from location A, controlling a vehicle there, that I do not want information about vehicles at location B. My camera is literally a billion kilometres away from those guys. If I want to see them, I can scroll in. It's infinitely more likely that I want to click on the planet, so I that I can plot a course to it. Just don't show the markers for these other ships unless my camera is at their perspective. (IE, ship in low Duna orbit should not be visible [much less overriding its parent body] from interstellar distances the camera views the Kerbol System from.  - minimap elements become distorted and overlap other elements of the map  - inconsistent course markers on the map view showing jittery distances despite an unobstructed course, making it impossible to accurately plot.  - it is very difficult to plot small changes >3 delta V. You are better off guessing and checking with an engine set to 1% thrust limiter, fishing for the course that will reduce your apogee manually. This is inefficient and time consuming, and it would be great to have the game do a little more to help you when you need a precise course change.  - Game will incorrectly report your current deltaV, or overall deltaV, on a variety of different screens and interfaces.   - Course information will sometimes jitter, and the game will report your perigee over a range of several kilometers. I see it most on a course from one planet to another, This makes it impossible to reliably set a course to aerobrake.  - Rotating parts in the VAB using WASDQE sometimes makes them unplacable on snap points.  - Staging often requires two clicks or spacebar presses, leading to a profound sense of dread wondering if this is the one where your rocket snaps in half and disintegrates because you staged twice.  - My last rocket was fairly excessive, but I was trying to get a payload of three vessels to Juul. It had 33 engines firing on the first stage, all small - medium parts, since that's where I was in the career mode. It might have been a stretch doing so much at once, but the game lets me, and it gave me the mission to get there knowing my constraints. Anyway, staging 12 SRBs at a time, my game would drop to 0 fps for 5-10 seconds. Literally no information from the display except whatever still image it landed on. Then, eventually, time would resume and the boosters begin to fall away.  - Debris sometimes becomes stuck midair above the space center only a few km in the air. I believe I have hit this derbies several times, but it's hard to tell with the lag happening up there, The debris sits at the altitude where I do my first/second stage. I think the game just gives up on the physics for spent fuel tanks.    - No way to filter debris off the map besides manually destroying each piece you leave behind at the tracking station.  - Test a fairing on the pad before you rely on it to release the payload. Trust me. The system is not very intuitive, and you cannot imagine my saddness watching a still-fully-encapsulated probe drifting away from my ship, and having no way whatsoever to release it.  - You will sometimes be unable to move or maneuver a ship that should be fully controllable, forcing a restart of the game  - My game has only ever alt-tabbed without crashing once. This is not an exaggeration.  - Ultrawide and 4k resolutions not supported natively  - Parts have no associated monetary cost, making the objectives in career mode feel a little bit lackluster. I can get anywhere if you let me use as many parts as I want. I'd recommend giving the user a money slider from infinite to soviet in order to add a layer of difficulty tailored to the individual's preferences  Summary: The bugs combine to make an incredibly frustrating experience. Bugs and game design choices amplify each other.  Career mode is cooler than KSP1. Lots of potential in the game. Just really a lot of technical debt to get through, and obviously since the game is feature incomplete, it will continue to be unstable for some time into the future. I think the devs can one day succeed at making Kerbal more accessible. I'm having a lot more fun playing campaign so far. I think the story they're putting together is cute, and they did a great job capturing the character of the original game.

133806368,english,0,954850,"As of its current state - I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING NOR PLAYING THIS GAME.  The fact that this even was considered to being released ignoring that abuse of Early Access does not justify the price tag and chaotic state of which this game is currently at.  Can we please stop treating Early Access as a term for Developers ramping up the Price and not caring a bit about if the game is actually you know functional.  This game promised a lot back in 2020 - and even promised to be released years earlier - and yet we're in 2023, with almost none of the features as well as missing the most basic of features from the first game.  I honestly cannot tell at this point if this game was even in development back when they said they were planning to release of if they simply kept redrawing their entire game without actually developing ontop of what they had.  This game is a joke of the first game as well as a mockery of Early Access Titles - honestly if the game isn't ready and needs beta testing do not post it as an premium ""early access"" when we're just paying to be a beta tester.   I'm extremely disappointed with the developers and with the fanbase who let this happen with not just this game but also with many other titles that abuse and misuse the term Early Access as Beta Channel.  EDIT: With the recent patch I'm more hopeful than before that KSP 2 might actually end up as a good game -  I also don't ignore the fact that KSP 1 was very different when it first released but due to the lack of attention and the lack of comparison there was no fallout. Where as this time there's an entire game to compare this too as well as a large audience.   I support the developers in actually helping to create this game, especially with their public outreach and support it brings me a lot of hope - what I'm annoyed about however is the publishers disconnect with the pricing and the understanding of what people are expecting from a £50 game.  As a Early Access buyer I hope that us forking up £50 for a game that's worth £10 or less should be rewarded in the future with some sort of special expansion or something at least to justify even being an EA user.  Publishers need to actually respect and understand the developers because if the developers aren't allowed to change the price to match the game public fallout will cost a lot more in the short and long term than any discounts would."

Love it. I do not recommend KSP2 Early Access in it's current state.  Why this early access is important: This is not the same team or company that made KSP1. The KSP IP was bought by Private Division and is now owned by Take Two Interactive. Private Division has asked Take Two for more funding to develop the game. Take Two denied it. The result is Private Division releasing this minimum viable product sold at premium price to cover ongoing development costs.  What this means: Do not defend this under the idea that KSP1 became a smash hit, it shares nothing with it. Do not assume anything positive or negative about the capability of the team to succeed or fail. Do not assume that Take Two will treat this any differently than any of it's other licensed titles.  This is a net-new initiative, treat it like it is. You are paying $50 for an Early Access. You are buying a promise from a new team run by a large detached corporation. There are concerns.  I will update my recommendation once it feels beneficial, but at this time I do not recommend it. Their are prolific game breaking bugs, very minimal content, and frustrating mechanics. While $50 may not be a big deal, funding this type of practice should be a consideration and what you expect from your money. Spend as you will."

176716187,english,0,954850,"It's now mid October of 2024. No updates in sight and knowing what happened with the studio that was developing this game, I think it's pretty safe to say that Kerbal Space Program 2 is officially 6 feet under.  I love KSP. The first game is one of my favorite games of all time, and I've spent many an hour screwing around with rocketry, blowing things up and learning along the way. I love space, I love space travel, and I love science, so in many ways KSP was an ideal game for me. That's why, as a huge fan of the original, it really does hurt to have seen the much-anticipated sequel be dragged through the mud, taken to the backyard and have a shotgun pressed against the back of its head. It sucks. Corporations really do ruin everything.  My advice to anybody who may read this, if indeed there are still people out there looking at this game, don't buy it. The game is done. If you want to play KSP, buy the first game. It doesn't get updated anymore, but it's still one of the most enjoyable experiences in gaming, whether you want to do things properly or just want to watch some fuel tanks explode (and 'accidentally' kill a bunch of astronauts while you're at it). The first game has a wonderful modding community with some of the most dedicated and talented modders I've personally ever seen outside of games like Skyrim or Minecraft. Essentially, the first game can be everything the second was meant to be, minus all of the bugs, crappy UI, astronomically high (pun not intended) system requirements, and broken dreams, of course.  As for KSP 2, well, I hate to say it, but this game belongs in the trash heap. I wouldn't say it's solely the developers' fault, but also Take Two for burning the studio down and, unfortunately, ruining what could have been a great game. Another lesson to remember, never pre-order games, especially not AAA ones."

178208145,english,0,954850,"""Kerbal Space Program 2"" is, without exaggeration, a monumental failure, a masterclass in how to ruin a beloved franchise, and an insult to anyone who trusted this development team with a sliver of hope. This so-called sequel is a sick joke—a buggy, broken, and utterly hollow disaster that doesn’t even deserve to be associated with the original *KSP*. The result is a toxic mix of empty promises, neglected fundamentals, and cynical greed.  First off, the performance issues are so shockingly severe that it’s a miracle the game even boots up. Calling it ‘poorly optimized’ would be generous; *KSP 2* feels like it was cobbled together by amateurs. It turns your PC into a glorified space heater, struggling under the weight of shoddy code that produces frame rates straight out of the Stone Age. It’s infuriating to play even the simplest missions when everything lags, crashes, and stalls as if the game is actively sabotaging you. How the developers let this heap of trash pass as a “finished” product defies logic.  The physics—the one aspect they absolutely could not afford to mess up—is a nonsensical mess. Rockets behave in absurd ways, randomly losing stability, ignoring logic, and self-destructing as if the game engine is being held together with chewing gum and hope. The once-satisfying challenge of engineering space missions has been turned into a tedious exercise in fighting against the broken mechanics of a game that’s forgotten what made it special. Calling this a ‘simulation’ of anything other than a money grab is laughable.  As for content, there’s practically nothing here. Where are the colonies? The promised interstellar travel? The new features that justified making a sequel in the first place? The game is a barren wasteland, barely distinguishable from the original, but with far fewer features and countless times the aggravation. The developers had years to build upon the foundation of *KSP*, but instead, they’ve delivered a stripped-down, soulless husk. It feels like they stopped developing halfway through and figured fans would be too blinded by nostalgia to notice.  And then there’s the utter disregard for the community. The developers’ silence is a slap in the face, demonstrating a level of disrespect that would be shocking if it weren’t so infuriating. It’s as though they thought they could cash in on the *KSP* brand name and quietly hope players wouldn’t notice the disaster they’d created. Updates are rare and ineffective, and when they do come, they barely scratch the surface of the game’s mountain of issues. It’s a blatant, greedy cash grab, with zero care for the quality or integrity of the product they’re selling.  ""Kerbal Space Program 2"" isn’t just a failure—it’s an abomination. It’s a scam dressed up in a familiar title, hoping to squeeze money out of loyal fans before they realize they’ve been duped. Stay away from this unholy wreck of a game. If you buy *KSP 2*, you’re not just wasting your money; you’re rewarding laziness, incompetence, and a complete betrayal of what *Kerbal Space Program* once stood for."

133783748,english,0,954850,"This is what happens when an incompetent development studio meets a greedy publisher.  This game was supposed to be released in 2020, as development began in 2017. We are getting a glorified tech demo in 2023 after multiple delayed release dates.   Yes, the game was likely pushed by the publisher and launched too early but who could blame them? They can't just keep throwing money and time at a development studio that obviously can't produce the game. The Q1 2023 release date was announced during a TakeTwo earnings call over a year ago, so don’t act like the devs haven’t had a YEAR to produce a stable release.  This game is not even remotely worth the price they are charging. Without going any further, $50 for an early access title is pushing it, $50 for this early access build of KSP2 is inexcusable. I can’t believe anyone involved with this game is happy asking people to spend $50 of their hard earned money for this, which they are because this “early access” title is being actively advertised.  The tech demo itself is a worse performing version of KSP1 with the most basic of parts, and no new features worth mentioning if you’re a fan of KSP1. The game is horribly optimized, the physics engine barely functions, the Kraken is worse than ever. By this point I am sure you’ve heard already the state of the demo if you’ve read this far. This could all be excused if the year was 2020 and they only charged $25-30, but again they are charging hard working people $50 to beta test their tech demo 3 years after the planned release date. To the “actually the game is discounted right now due to early access”, sorry but the $10 discount means nothing when they haven’t provided even provided 10% of what was supposed to be released years ago. I think early access is a great program and has produced some of my favorite games, but this is hardly ready to be put out.  No, I am not going to pay essentially full price now in anticipation of further development from the devs. That is not the purpose of the early access program. Rule 2 from Steam’s early access overview states that:  “2. Do not make specific promises about future events. For example, there is no way you can know exactly when the game will be finished, that the game will be finished, or that planned future additions will definitely happen. Do not ask your customers to bet on the future of your game. Customers should be buying your game based on its current state, not on promises of a future that may or may not be realized.” (Read the above rule again if you need to)   The devs have stated themselves on Steam:  “The 1.0 version of KSP 2 will include significantly more features than the Early Access version, such as what you see on the roadmap plus other items added along the way. This includes: · More parts and the opportunity for more creative builds · More star systems and hidden anomalies · Improved quality of life and onboarding to open up the vast beauty of space to even more players · Continued performance improvements and visual updates We can’t wait for you to join us on this journey into the stars!”  Based on the devs verbiage above, how are they not asking me to bet on the future of the game? They are asking me to pay $50 and hope they implement their planned roadmap when haven’t even proved they can make a functioning game. They can’t even release the most basic version of the game possible that isn’t objectively terrible after YEARS of development. Y'all are saying that you'd happily spend $50 for the game as is?  Anyone who worked on this game does not deserve a dime from the consumer. If that means KSP2 is cancelled then it is for the best. This release is a shameless cash grab by a publisher who needs to recoup costs from an incompetent development studio that has wasted years of production. I never thought these predatory business practices could happen to a franchise that has so much passion, from fans and the great people who worked on KSP1."

If my child's development was as poor as KSP2's development, I would have drowned her in a lake."
164409609,english,0,954850,"With today's announcement that Take-Two has laid off the entirety of Intercept Games (confirmed per Bloomberg), I'll finally write my review, which is something I had held off doing until my last drop of hope evaporated. KSP2's development was not as controversial as many online would have you believe, especially compared to more scandalous ones, but for me it is by far the most disappointed I've ever been with a video game.  KSP2 was announced in August of 2019 at Gamescon, slated to release in 2020 by Star Theory Games, formerly known as Uber Entertainment. Wikipedia states:  ""For various reasons, the release date was pushed back to Q3 2021.""  This is a really funny sentence to me in 2024, knowing that the early access (EA) release would not be coming until a year and a half after that date. During this time, Take-Two established a new studio under Private Division called Intercept Games, poaching a dozen employees from Star Theory, including creative director Nate Simpson and lead producer Nate Robinson. The game would continue a long string of announced delays with little communication and progress updates in between, foreshadowing what was to come. Finally, in October of 2022, an early access release date of February 24, 2023 was announced. The date was, for once, one Intercept Games would stick to. Along with this announcement came a road map of major features for future updates, which outlined the following: early access, science, colonies, interstellar, exploration, and multiplayer, to be release chronologically over an unrevealed timeline. The hype that had died down over the years was [mostly] restored, and Intercept Games had bitten off more than they could chew.  Before I get into the release, I want backtrack a bit and have everyone watch the Cinematic Announcement Trailer that was released 4 years ago:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_nj6wW6Gsc&  Who is responsible for this? It is by far the best game trailer I've ever seen. It EMBODIES what players love about Kerbal Space Program: the mystique of other worlds, the scale of space, the clumsiness of Kerbals, and the drive we have to succeed after failure. The latter two quite literally embody the Kerbal way, as anyone from KSP1 who has stranded their loyal astronauts on Duna or straight up murdered them on the launchpad can confirm. If you were involved in any way with this trailer, give yourself a huge pat on the back. It may very well be the only good thing Intercept Games ever accomplished.  Two weeks before the early access release, ESA held a preview event where content creators could play the game for a few hours. Many of these content creators recording themselves playing and something seemed, well, off. You can see it in their eyes and the way they talk about the game. The very framework which would support every roadmap feature was not built on solid ground.  Two weeks later, early access was released. I recall some buzzing in the discord in the days before release about the frame rate, but Intercept has a history of being proactive with the ban hammer and anyone who commented these things was swiftly removed. Forced positivity was the subterfuge they needed to convince themselves that what was about to release was worth a fraction of the resources that had supposedly been poured into it. To cut a long story short, release day was a complete and utter disaster. Performance was abymsal with many high end systems topping out at 15fps, crafts were generally wonky and not in the ""Kerbal"" way, anti-aliasing looked jagged, maneuver nodes were busted (if you could even manage to get to space in the first place), no reentry heating, and an unlimited number of other failures all reared their ugly faces. Even the tutorials themselves didn't feel like KSP. Wrap all those mistakes into a $50 price tag and it's not hard to see why KSP2's player count dipped below KSP1 within days of launch. I'm not going to pretend like I stuck it out and spent my time troubleshooting and reporting bugs to make the game better. I did what any sensible person would do and asked Steam for a refund.  The period that followed went as you would aspect: poor damage control. Intercept gaslighted their fan base and ruled with an iron first on their forums and Discord server. Nate occasionally posted updates on their forums, filled with so much technical jargon it made reading them a bigger chore than booting up the game itself. Other than that, there was a lot of radio silence. I encourage everyone to give this website a whirl, which displays the scale of our solar system if the Moon was only 1 pixel:  https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html  While you're scrolling, imagine each planet is an update given by Nate on the development of KSP2. The analogy works. Trust me.  In October of 2023, Nate gave a speech at Space Creator Day, in which he outlined some of KSP2's development problems before announcing the first roadmap update, For Science!, which ended up releasing in December of 2023. Performance had improved throughout 2023, and For Science! would give players objectives to work towards, but many of the release day issues remained unsolved, and many questions were still unanswered, like:  How could a planned release date of 2020 be delayed three years into a rushed EA release? Why did you double down on Unity knowing the same limitations would still be there? And ten thousand others you can scour the Internet for in your free time.  There is something really special about Kerbal Space Program. It feels unique, quirky, and most of the time, it just works. Games in this position are invaluable, and very hard to follow up with successful successors. Cities: Skylines 2 and Roller Coaster Tycoon World are more recent examples of games that, by and large, failed to recapture any of what made their predecessors unique. Even at its best, which it rarely ever was, KSP2 never felt like KSP1. Sid Meier once said his design philosophy for designing and creating his games is to ""play them, over and over, until they are fun."" It's clear that Meier's wisdom was never present in the development of KSP2, since it was never at any point any fun. Such is the early access fate, and shame on all of us for buying into it again. No lessons will be learned and will all be stewing in our anger in a few months at the next major letdown.  Kerbal Space Program 2 set its sights on the stars. Unfortunately, it sits abandoned at the launch site, having never even taken flight.  Take-Two ruins everything they get their hands on. F*** Take-Two."

The performance and gameplay are very simliar to KSP1 in early development. The only drawback was I got KSP1 for free. I still paid for the steam version anyway, just to add it to my library. But if you want to be a part of this game's early development, here is your opportunity to do so.  PROS: good looking game. from the space ship skins, to the planetary ambiance with music for each planet to the rocket plumes and particles.  CONS: sandbox only, noodle rockets, no water effects, random glitches and wierd-happenings, trip planning is difficult.  Grain of salt: Buy it knowing this is the worst stage of development it is ever going to be in. Just enough to call a game engine, with a large upside for future upgrades."

188169131,english,0,954850,"Purchasing this game was probably the worse financial investment I've made in the past 5 years.  Less content than the KSP1 at the price of a AAA game. Development while not officially abandoned, has been abandoned.  Last update was June 11th 2025, it is currently 17 February 2025. Take-Two sold off their ""Private Division"" (the publisher). The purchaser? A private equity firm, Haveli Investments. Annapurna Interactive had all 25 of their employees resign on September of 2024. Apparently those employees intend to create a new company and take over the portfolio. This company doesn't even have a name yet.   Basically, this game lost traction, before anything can happen with this game entire companies must be created, staffed, and then they have to put this game on the list of games to be worked on.   You can essentially just google Kerbal Space Program 2 and find out very quickly that the Overwhelmingly Negative reviews are 100% valid, justified, and the customers who have been unfortunate enough to buy into this game were sold an intent to make a game, when there was no intent to actually produce the game and instead sold off as they bid adieu with a middle finger in our general direction."
137014265,english,0,954850,"Kerbal Space Program was the perfect example of why Early Access should have worked. KSP2 is the perfect example of why Early access doesn't work. Early access was meant to deploy a mostly functional product in order to get community feedback for final polishing. It has since been warped into a quick cash grab by people releasing barely functional games and hoping they can make the money BEFORE their product is any good.   KSP2 isn't an early access game. It's a company that got too full of itself charging you $50 for what should be a free open beta. Very little works properly: * The VAB is glitchy as heck. Symmetry is iffy, and the camera will randomly jump to another position when you're just trying to pan up or down a bit. * Electric Charge doesn't seem to be working / draining * I reentered sideways to get a feel for heat management. No reentry fire effects, no explosions, nothing. I just skidded through the air all the way down to parachute deployment... UNTIL * I reverted to launch and tried again. At about 60km the ship suddenly popped out of existence (no explosion that I could see / hear) and the flight log came up saying I reentered too fast and burned up.  I could go on and on, having experienced a week's worth of bugs in under 2 hours... the graphics are iffy, the performance is horrible even on my 3090 at 1920x1080, the physics feel off, the airplane SAS wobbles like a dog shaking off water, staging will sometimes do 2 stages with a single activation... basically stuff that should have been fixed ""barely out of alpha.""  I am SOOO disappointed with the devs for this. I was super excited for KSP2 after putting a bazillion hours into KSP1. I was willing to keep the game and endure some lack of content and a few funny bugs to support the developer and wait as they fixed the last bits. Not after seeing this atrocity. I am getting a refund... and now not only have they ruined my excitement... they have probably ensured that I will not re-buy their game (even after it's fixed) or support them in their other projects.  ...

But the silence following the firing of the development team is simply compounding the lie. That should not be condoned.  I will also add that KSP 1 is a better game at present and unless KSP 2 is further developed it will be for the foreseeable future.

""Kerbal Space Program 2 will build on the beloved modding capabilities of the original game, as well as deliver on the long-requested addition of multiplayer. Soon players will be able to share the challenges of deep space exploration. More details on these features will be revealed at a later time.""   As of writing this, Colonies, Interstellar travel, Multiplayer are non-existent in the game and sue to the state of the development are false claims being used to sell the idea of a game that will never be complete. I cannot comment on the state of modding support but have gathered from the modding community it was not left in a good state of support.   Frankly given that this game was used by the parent company take2 interactive through the proxy company private division as a cash grab, it should be delisted as a scam, but at the very least, the store page should be updated to correctly display the current state of the game. Many of the features advertised would not be discovered on a normal runthrough for well over the accepted refund period of 2 hours.  The development of this game has been canceled indefinitely.

Hold fire and wait for future patches, KSP1, modded KSP1 both blow this out of the water at this point in time.

It’s like being a test-driver and there is a wreck without tires in front of you.  Ok, don’t buy it….don’t! simply don’t!   I did and they can keep my money. But do yourself a favour and wait at least another year.....  UPDATE:  did I expect major improvements with patch 1: no do I try to be fair and just try it, maybe motivated by a dev-response that the patch solves many issues:  sure, it would be rude to ignore it  an now? for me it's still a wreck, still massive staging/fuel issues, still disintegrating ships...and somewhat the performance seems worse. ( and yes even with a new save) do they just choose the CRM-path to solve their issues...would be sad"

I never got into KSP 1 but the tutorials in KSP 2 helped me understand the mechanics and concepts which i could then translate to KSP 1. Im having a blast in KSP 1 now due to KSP 2 so its not completely a waste.  I know this is early access but it's really really broken. Probably some execs pushed for this game's release. I dont think any dev with any shred of respect for their craft would release a passion project like this in it's current state. Execs need to get their heads out of their bum and let them finish in their pace. This can only hurt KSP in the long run and subsequently the devs. Execs just fire the workers and get moved to another project to milk."

I expected that KSP1 is the base starting point. I expected thermodynamics to be active.  Maybe in the future I can recommend, but as of today I do not recommend.   For context on the state of optimization my setup is:  Ryzen 5900X RTX 3080 12 GB 32 GB ram @ 3600 Mhz  For 1080p High  I get 60 FPS on launch pad(prior to launch) and roughly 20-30 FPS during the launch."

What about planes? Well once again the block system of wings has been neutered and replaced with a less enjoyable less expansive system of jankly moving your mouse around to change the size and shape. Or what if you wanted a new game, with multiplayer base building and exploration? Why do you keep asking because none of the promises at launch have been carried out (even after a whole year). Honestly after having owned and played ksp 1 since 2013 this is a terrible let down, but the mods will choose to go onto Instagram and post kerbals next to pride flags instead of working on the game to make us feel better about being fucked in the ass."
133512458,english,0,954850,"I have about 550 hours in KSP, it is a part of my inspiration for getting a mechanical engineering degree so obviously I had to get KSP 2. This game shows a lot of promise but at the moment it is completely unplayable. I've only attempted to do one mission so far, I decided to do the Jool 5 as a test to myself and the game since I would need a pretty complex craft so I will walk you through my experience.   Specs:  GPU: RTX3080 CPU: i9-10850k Monitor: 1440p 144hz Ram: 32GB   Firstly, they changed some things with how the VAB controls, all of which I've seen are objectively worse and incredibly frustrating. I don't know who complained about the VAB controls but it is complete garbage now. I still have no idea how to move up and down my rocket, It used to be Shift-scroll wheel, now it seems to be entirely random what I get to be focused on, might be a bug but please if this is intentional, give an option for legacy controls. Also no idea why they needed to over complicate the fairings, what they had before was fine. Placing struts seems to randomly lag the game, sometimes holding a single frame for so long I think it has crashed and then it comes back. Somehow worse than all that was the nonstop tutorial notifications that I thought I had said no to when I first started the game and there was no option I could find in the settings to turn them off.  On the launch pad I was getting 20fps even while meeting or exceeding the recommended system requirements. Worse than that though my rocket was flopping around like it was made of rubber. Adding on even more struts did not fix this issue either. Somehow when I launched however it managed to fly straight so idk what that was about.  Once in space the sound design and most graphics were pretty awesome, was getting about 50fps. Love the new navball and maneuver nodes, gives me all the information I am looking for right there. New exhaust cones are absolutely beautiful and have fantastic sound design. When I was decoupling my boosters or first stage they also seemed to stick to my craft for some reason but a quicksave and load fixed it so it was fine I guess. My main complaint is that if you zoom out to a medium distance your craft and all the planets look blurry, not sure if its the anti-aliasing or something, I tried messing with the settings, but it just looked bad, and considering the performance issues it was really confusing why it looked so awful. Looked great when you zoom in though.  Here's where the game goes from good, to great, to unplayable. I went for a gravity assist around the mun when I heard the new sound track for it and maybe it was just really good timing but the music started to swell and build as I was getting closer and closer on my fly by and burn to Jool.  Then I exited kerbin's SOI and was met with the star's sound track which was also very good. Then I entered Jools SOI and was met it's kinda of brassy jazzy sound track which fit perfectly. Then as I started my gravity capture assist with Tylo I heard yet ANOTHER new sound track and in that moment I was really excited because I realized that every single moon will have a new sound track me to listen to while I explore.  Then I tried undocking my lander and it flew off with an extra 300m/s of delta V for no reason. So I tried to reload the quicksave that I always make before I try to do things like that and It brought me back to the launch pad... This was extra confusing because as you may remember I had quick saved and quick loaded to unstick my stages when they wouldn't properly decouple. I had done that several times, and I religiously spam the f5 button after every maneuver and every action because I know these things happen all the time in KSP, you simply can not play the game with an iron man mindset.  So I go to manually load the save from the menu and sure enough there it is. But when I go to load it? Completely corrupted. My first flight, my first save completely unplayable. Everything else I could deal with, but I can't play the game if it's going to be completely filled to the brim with game breaking bugs AND not allow me to quick load after they happen.  Tl;dr Pros:  Great music, great sound design, looks pretty (sometimes) Cons: No features, significantly more buggy, laggy, awful VAB controls, horrible performance, pop-ups are constant and you can't get rid of them."

138761194,english,1,954850,"I invested over 1500 hours in KSP1, and after playing 8 hours on KSP2 I can comfortably say it is worth investing in if you were a fan of the original. ""Investing"" is the appropriate term by the way; yes, there is more to do in the original at present, but if you're a fan who's in it for the long haul you might as well get it for a relative discount compared to full release pricing and play in the sandbox while they put together the full package.  There are numerous bugs that remain; in my last play session I had 1/3 XL landing legs pop off my Moho lander midway through deployment; the camera at launch initially points upside down till I toggle chase mode, and struts went through SRB's which makes separation tricky, but the core mechanics and trial/error that I loved in KSP1 are very much intact. Besides bug fixes/optimizations, the game very much needs a progression system to offer that sense of accomplishment from the original, so I was glad to read that the development team is focusing more of their energy on long-term progression; hopefully Science mode will be on its way soon as I think it could be exactly what the game needs.  To add to all this, I'm running it on a below-minimum machine: an Optiplex 3060 MT with a GTX 1650 for a GPU. The GPU is well below the minimum spec, and though I have to commit all setting to low and occasionally switch my resolution to 720p to stay around 30fps, it is definitely a playable experience if you're a dedicated fan. I've also noticed improvements on bugs and performance over the last couple patches, so I'm hopeful this will continue as patches carry on.  Overall, the game is far from ideal in its present state, but it is exactly what I expected from Early Access, and if you're as obsessed as I am with KSP1, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy playing around in the sequel; just watch out for the Kraken!"
133548498,english,0,954850,"How has the modern gaming industry come to this. I have spend hundreds of hours in the first game and was counting the days until this game released. I bought it as soon it was unlocked and was exited to play. I am absolutely appalled by the state of this game. I understand its in beta I understand it will be fixed later but how has our modern gaming industry got to the point where game developers are no longer paying for beta testers, instead relying on dedicated fans to spend $50 on a broken game to beta test for them. I want to like this game, i really do. I think it has a lot of potential to add a large amount of content over the original game but the problem is none of it works. I truthfully hate that the modern gaming industry has decided that selling a completely broken game and fixing it later has become the accepted norm now. Again, I recognize this is a beta release and bugs are expected. But when basic things such as capsule recovery does not work and your kerbals disappear into the ether that's just unacceptable. Despite years of delays this game is not even close to being anything close to being done. and while yes most of these problems will probably be fixed in future updates to the game, the main problem of a product being rushed to market in a clearly unfinished state can never be undone. Companies should not make their most dedicated fans pay for the honor of debugging their new games."
133550163,english,0,954850,"I do not suggest the game at this stage.   I cannot believe 3+ years in dev and the game runs poorly as it does. They cannot use the indie dev as an excuse anymore as its a bigger team with a publisher behind them.   I am running 3080 with 64 gigs of ram with a i9 11th gen CPU and when I built a small plane with 4 booster engines 4 small fuel tanks and 2 main fuel tanks for the main engine, and it lags like hell.   I am sick of these early access thinking they can charge 50 bucks for a very poor quality game. I was fine with missing features as its what ever but no excuse for the cost vs crappy optimization where its frustrating playing the game.   I do not get to even see the crashing or explosion very well as it jitters freezes, etc... during its crashing of the ship."

There are some fun things to find as well. I would still not really recommend the game in the current state over e.g. KSP1. If you'd like to support the developers, consider buying this at a discount, otherwise I would honestly still wait until there is more content in the game.  Old review:  You can build half a rocket that will wobble to orbit. If you manage to leave orbit, you will probably be unable to land anywhere because of other bugs, or your rocket will just randomly explode. Trajectory lines are bugged. Heat shielding is not needed as there is no heat in the game. No patch with anything new for 5 months despite everything being 'near completion'. Not worth the money at the moment. If I could refund I would. Wish the devs the best"

189333958,english,1,2246340,"I have played every monster hunter game since Tri at least twice, and I usually play to complete the HR100 or equivalent boss on every save. I also played the older live service games, Monster hunter frontier and Monster hunter online. Here are my thoughts on wilds (HR70/50 hours in game at time of writing):   Positives-  POOGIE IS BACK  Monster hunter wilds is really fun, and anyone familiar with the series will like it a lot. The gameplay loop hasn't changed, and capcom has implemented a ton of quality of life changes that make it more accessible to people who want to hunt more and grind materials less.  The new monsters are all really cool, along with their weapon and armor designs. Capcom does not miss when it comes to aesthetics in these games.  As a veteran hunter, I was worried the combat in this game would not be as enjoyable as previous titles, and while hunts are the easiest they have ever been, the attacks and animations in this game FEEL SO GOOD you basically don't notice. I have not used seikret or mantels during combat to make it more challenging, and used un-upgraded starting armor through LR6, but throughout the whole story (both low and high rank) I only carted [died] about 3 times, and did not fail a single quest. I was planning on avoiding using focus mode and exploiting wounds as well, but honestly they are so fun and satisfying to use I would sacrifice the difficulty for the satisfaction. Despite the lack of difficulty, the gameplay loop and game feel is worth 70$ to me personally.  The story in this game is... an improvement from previous entries. The characters, cutscenes, and storyline are more involved and compelling than previous installments, but to be honest, I don't think many people are playing monster hunter for a compelling story. unga bunga hammer go bonk, and all that  Overall, the game feel is impeccable, and I will probably end up putting at least a couple hundred hours into it before its G/Master rank expansion releases in a couple years. Capcom has already promised half a dozen or more free title updates over the next year that will include new monsters and loads of event quests and other things to do in the game. For me at least, the $70 is worth it to satiate my addiction to this series.   Negatives-  Performance is really bad. I have a Ryzen 9 5950x and a 3090 and I am playing this game at 4k high, raytracing off and getting 45FPS. This is playable for me because I spent a decade playing on a 3ds outdoors at 20 fps, but understandably many people are not willing to play a 70$ game below 60fps or able to afford a PC capable of more than 30fps.  On top of the low framerates, graphical bugs are not uncommon either. I personally have experienced the ""black triangle"" 3 or 4 times in my 45 hours of gameplay, which causes a flashing black triangle to fill about a quarter of your screen for 20 seconds or so for no apparent reason, which makes the game almost unplayable while its happening. I have also seen the ""PS2 graphics"" bug, where some models appear to have about 100 polygons like OG Final Fantasy 7. For me this happened once after fast travelling and it resolved itself after about 3 seconds. I personally have not experienced any game crashes (I'm on the latest version of Windows 11 with the latest graphics drivers).  In classic capcom fashion, the menus in this game are heinous.  in particular, setting up multiplayer is particularly problematic until you figure out the system, so I will explain what you need to do to get it working the way you expect it too:  Basically, you want to have your friends in a lobby AND a link party at the same time. The lobby is basically how you can see your friends in the overworld, while a link party allows you to go on quests together as a group. you can go on quests together using either one, but for the best experience, you want both. To set it up: 1. you want one person to create a private lobby after selecting their save data on the home screen. 2. after loading in to the game, that player should get the lobby ID by going to the member list screen (start -> tab 4, labelled ""communication"" -> member list). The lobby ID will be displayed on the right. This player should send that lobby ID to everyone they want to play with. 3. The other players should select ""lobby search"" and then ""find a lobby based on ID"". (finding from in game or steam friends lists seems to have a 30% or less success rate, lobby ID works every time in my experience). 4. After loading in to the lobby, one player should go back to the member list mentioned before, and go to the ""lobby"" tab, then select and invite the other players to a link party. 5. The other players then need to accept the link party invite, either by holding the plus button on their controller after they receive the notification, or by going to start -> communication -> invites -> received invites.  From here, players will be able to see eachother in the overworld (because they are in the same lobby) and will automatically be able to join quests the other players post (because of the link party). Keep in mind a private lobby can have 16 players but a link party is only 4, so your lobby can have 4 groups of 4. You can also join quests from outside a link party by talking to Alma, so you can do quests with anyone else in the lobby, its just less convenient. You can have a link party between players in different lobbies and a lobby with no link parties, but you probably want both.  lastly, I personally found the music to be a little underwhelming compared to previous entries.  None of the negatives are severe enough to be a deal breaker to me, especially since most of them will (hopefully) be patched out.  EDIT:  After thinking about it a while last night, I realized that what really sets the old world games (everything before Monster hunter world) apart from the more recent ones is the feeling that you are really in an intense fight with a monster. I cant really put my finger on what makes that difference, but it has something to do with the players ability to move more freely in current games.  Old world games required a lot more intentionality and commitment to attacks because a poorly timed or spaced attack could cost a cart. I feel like I can get through basically any hunt in Wilds by mashing buttons on my controller while wielding a sword and shield, but I do look WAY cooler doing it in wilds than in any other game.  Part of what I enjoy about monster hunter is the community aspect. Joining a random quest to get materials you need and finding people spamming stickers and gestures and having fun in post game is as relevant as the combat itself to me. Those kinds of interactions aren't as accessible in old world games as they used to be (albiet not impossible to find).  I'm playing with 2 different groups of friends so I am having fun helping them progress through the game while using my own time to do fashion hunting and grind materials for melding armor spheres and artian upgrades. Capcom added event quests and more weekly challenges today. Even if I don't enjoy this game the same way I did old world games, I am still having a lot of fun playing it and it still feels like there is enough for me to do (although I wish there was more).  While it doesn't impact my review of this game at all, I would encourage anyone that enjoys wilds as their first monster hunter to play an old world game like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.   Update as of HR100/~60 hours in game: I was at steam review character limit so I put it on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7acuo/"
190034181,english,1,2246340,"After 60 hours, hunting every monster, and hitting HR 75, I think I can say this is a good entry into the Monster Hunter franchise.   The elephant in the room is of course being the performance and technical state of the game. Quite frankly, this launch is unacceptable. There's no reason for my new rig with a 4070ti and a Ryzen 5 7600x should be struggling to hit 60fps at 1080p. It seems like they really want you to use frame generation on your first bootup as a magic bandaid, but that's not how this works. Bad performance is bad performance. This alone would normally get me to give it a negative review.  But dammit, this game is so fun. It's all I've been thinking about lately. In terms of the core gameplay, this is the best monster hunter has ever been. Everything feels good to use, every weapon is fun, every fight is cinematic, and every monster is diverse, and in my opinion, more interesting than the monsters in base world.  That being said, it's not all fantastic. The other elephant in the room is the difficulty of the game, which has been a hot topic, and has been since World even. This was my experience: I played most of the game solo or with a buddy, and I honestly didn't see much issue with the difficulty. I'm not a Monster Hunter expert, but I'm not a beginner either, so I expected low rank to be a pushover and it was, no problem with that. High rank saw a boost in difficulty, primarily with the Apex Predators, that I was happy with. Not too hard (which will come in master rank I'm sure) but not brain dead. I rarely carted throughout the game, but I also played previous Monster Hunters and still had to actually fight. From my memory this is about the experience I had in World as well.   But then I decided to play some 4-player SOS missions, and the dynamic changed entirely. Most monsters rarely attacked since they were constantly getting hammered, wounded, and stunned, including late monsters. World wasn't entirely difficult either, but this slaughter wasn't as common place even with 4 other players. It feels like the game was balanced for solo and duo play and not much else, the monster health is super low and the wound status rate is too high, which just creates scenarios where 4 players wail on the monster creating perpetual wounds. A big appeal of Monster Hunter is the multiplayer, which makes this a bit of a disappointment. Teaming up in Monster Hunter usually always makes it easier, but it really shouldn't be this much of a leap to where hunts end almost as soon as you reach the monster. This WASN'T the case in World, I still felt like 4-player hunts were fun in that game even if it was a tad easier.   In general, multiplayer is the weak point of this. Needlessly complicated to even get into a game, in some cases even a downgrade from prior games in terms of accessibility. I don't see the reason for the distinction between Lobbies, Link Groups, and Environment Links. It just seems overly complicated and poorly explained. And of course, the famous communication error makes a grand return.  Arena missions are missing as well, which is unfortunate. Some of my favorite memories of previous Monster Hunter games were teaming with a friend to get the best time with the pre-selected gear setups, but that aspect of the game is gone. Hopefully it makes a return in a future title update or in the Master Rank expansion. (EDIT: Confirmed for title update 1!!)  And then there's some general gameplay changes, i.e. the Seikret mount, no monster tracking, easy escapes and heals. To be fair, most of these were introduced in Rise and were just brought back to this, but generally I don't think they were needed and likelycontribute to the lack of challenge veterans are experiencing. Hunters and Palicoes have more tools now than ever before, but the monsters haven't been buffed to match (yet) and it's starting to show the divide. Again, low and high rank are all that's available, so I can't say whether this is necessarily good or bad yet, but I can't deny some of the Monster Hunter identity seems to be lost. Tracking and searching may have been shallow, boring, and frustrating in the other entries, but it was a part of the charm of actually hunting the monster. You could argue with that gone you can get right to the good bit, which is the fights, but then it just ends up feeling like a boss rush game and less like a hunt, especially when ""prep-time"" feels like more of an afterthought now more than ever.   That being said, I have still thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game (and not done yet!) and think it's still some of the best gameplay the series has to offer, which at the end of the day is what draws me in. This is the perfect starting point for a new hunter and has a lot to offer. Just keep in mind Monster Hunter is famous for confusing progression and menus, and just have fun with it without getting bogged down too much. Looking forward to crown hunting (yes I'm crazy), updates, and Master Rank!"
189066635,english,1,2246340,"Guys, I like the gameplay and all, but could you add more menus to the game? I feel like there are not enough menus in the game. I would like at least 2x more menus for each interaction. Also, I think 2-3 types of party aren't enough to play with a friend. We need at least 5-6 types. Maybe with 2-3 menus each. Also, could you add 2-3 submenus in the main-menu?"
190904134,english,1,2246340,"To say I've put in quite a few hours over the past few weeks would be an understatement, so obviously I had a good time. If I take away some of my bias, it barely passes the recommended line though, and definitely with some caveats.  [h3]Caveat 1: Optimization[/h3] Let's start with the elephant in the room. The game runs worse than QWOP. You need a top of the line rig and preferably 2 to 3 mods in order to ensure it runs smooth enough on higher graphic settings. If you own a more affordable PC, there are about 10 different optimization guides and a reddit megathreat to help you out with making the game playable.  If that's not your cup of tea, don't buy the game until they fix this premium priced mess.  [h3]Caveat 2: Difficulty[/h3] I started with Monster Hunter Rise, and it was the same story back then. The new mechanic made the game too easy. Now I hear similar arguments about Seikrets making the game too easy.  I think a lot of people understate the fact that escape mechanics are relatively trivial in the long run. When I started in Rise, I needed that escape to succeed quests. As I got more experienced at hunting monsters, it started to feel like an easy escape button. After hundreds of hours the ability became trivial since I had mastered my dodges and evades.  When I started in Wilds, I very rarely used my Seikret escape button. It's because I came in with thousands of hours of experience. Experience that translates to this game, because at its core it's still a Monster Hunter game. As the title updates and eventually master rank will arrive, we will see a bump in difficulty, until we min-maxed those end game builds. Then everyone will be complaining again that it's too easy.  I don't think the same applies to new players though, or the ones that play every now and then. Monster Hunter in general is very overwhelming if it's your first entry into the series, and I believe Wilds strikes a good balance between difficulty, survivability and most importantly...fun. There is very little that stops you from playing the game. There is almost always something you can do through skills, items or abilities.  In other words, if you are a veteran looking for a difficult Monster Hunter game, I can't recommend this one. If you are new to series, and have a NASA PC at home, and are willing to install mods, I can recommend this game.  [h3]Caveat 3: Purpose of Monster Hunter[/h3] I hear a lot of complaints about how the series is turning away from its original purpose. I can't account for that myself because this is my second Monster Hunter game. What I can account for is my own reason for why I boot up the game. It's to hunt monsters. And in my opinion, that's the most important part of a Monster Hunter game.  Hunts may or may not last shorter. Tools may or may not be unlocked quicker. I don't know. What I do know, is that the fights are amazing. In between the 10 million stutters, frame freezes and disconnects of course. Whether that's 4 veterans absolutely destroying a monster, or just you, your weapon and your skills. There is also a good variety of monsters, given that this is only the starting roster.  In order to get to the fun part you do need to put in some hours though. Monster Hunter is notorious for feeling clunky at first. There is a flow which most people only start to appreciate after they have spend a substantial amount of time with the combat mechanics. Once you have found the weapon that fits with your flow, hunts starts to feel like dances with the monsters, and it feels great. That's why I keep playing.  If you're down for that, then I can recommend this game. Again, provided you have a NASA PC at home and a Nexus account for some optimization mods. If you are looking for elaborate preparation rituals and a deep understanding of the game in order to beat monsters, then this is not the game for you.  [h3]Caveat 4: Multiplayer[/h3] If you want to play with friends, there are lobbies, squads, link parties, hunter friends and two different voice chat channels. It's a confusing mess. Once you know where to look it's quite simple of course, but you need a 5 step guide to help you do this for the first time.  If you are more of a solo player, you can't cue up for SOS quests. Instead the game shows you a list of all the SOS quests that are ''available.'' You have to manually click on one, request to join, wait, click away a message that says you can't join the session, click away another message that says you can't join the quest, back out of the quest menu, select another quest from the list, and repeat the process. Just host your own quests, it's much better for your mental health.  [h3]Story and Music[/h3] Lastly I want to touch on 2 more points. The story is alright. It actually ties into the locales you visit and the monsters you hunt. It also has some cool lore bits if you are into that. But it's nothing to write home about. The monster themes on the other hand are absolute bangers.  [h3]In Conclusion[/h3] If you want to have some fun hunting monsters with or without others, then I can recommend this game. It has a good starting roster of monsters and there is more to come. The combat will take some time to get used to, but after that there is a lot of fun to be had if you ask me. Even when you got fights down to a science. Aside from the actual fights, it has little else going for it. Hopefully, for now.  However, the game is optimized so badly that I can only recommend it in good faith if you have a very solid PC. If that's not the case, I would wait until they have rolled out enough patches to at least make the optimization mods obsolete.  [i]Edits: spotted some grammar mistakes.[/i]"
189304061,english,1,2246340,"Incredible Game. After 60 and just hitting HR 100 I can say that - while I think the basegame DOES lack a bit of content compared to the release of the other Titles I played:  - Investigations are insanely fun - Farming for Items be it Armor or Decos is incredibly fun and feels like a rewarding loop that didnt get stale for me so far - Outside of 2 Figths every Monster in this Game on release for me is a good and fun one.   THE PC PORT HOWEVER LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED. Lots of graphical issues and the game crashes for me at least like once a day. To however complains about the difficulty: Yes the Game isnt that hard, but its fights are fun and imo thats what matters way more"
189158919,english,0,2246340,"Cool game, awful performance and worse optimisation. Capcom, if you do end up fixing the game and you'd like me to edit this review into a positive one it will cost you £3.49 for a ""Review edit voucher""."
188928780,english,0,2246340,"Ok, I'll say this Capcom. I love your games, I even loved this game so far, it has a lot of incredible stuff in it. I can see why people are giving it 8/10, 9/10, even 10/10. I'm even able to play it at a comfortable stable framerate with good visuals, because thankfully I'm blessed with quite a decent setup. But WHAT THE HELL is this lack of optimization and you trying to force Framegen on us? Not everyone is even able to use this tech. I saw how the game runs and looks on consoles, also not the best situation there.   You'd think that the whole situation with Dragon's Dogma 2 would change smth for the better, and instead we have this.   As of now, unless you have a beefy PC or an absolute MH fan, who'd play this game at a low locked framerate with possible sacrifices in terms of visuals, do NOT buy this game. Wait for a sale, better optimization, or whenever you have an amazing rig. This is the worst AAA product in terms of it's technical state that I've seen in a LONG time man."
189282970,english,1,2246340,"Performance is rough, but this is the best monster hunter has ever been. If you can run it, it is absolutely incredible."
188915707,english,0,2246340,"This game is absolutely amazing - but has the worst optimisation I've ever seen.  I understand that new games are becoming more demanding and people are expected to upgrade, but this is absurd. I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point.  I am by no means saying the game is bad, but in its current state, you should probably consider waiting for a more stable release."
190708376,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter has been my favorite franchise for a long time, and I am very excited for the new generation of Monster Hunter.   My first impression after 20 hours of game time, I feel like there are a lot of aspects that have been simplified.   There are no more hunting monster tracks. You just get on your mount, and it will carry you to your target automatically.  Another aspects I like in Monster Hunter is how important preparation is, but in Wild, that doesn't realy matter. You forgot to bring a warming potion, oh don't worry, the game has you covered.   I could write a lot of paragraphs complaining about how much easier this game is compared to its predecessor, but maybe people are tired of it.    However after 80 hours. I finally realized that Wild is a better game for me, at least now, since I don't have much time to play games anymore, let alone having to hunt one monster for up to 60 minutes.  I hope that with so many QOL's that make hunting easier, Capcom can balance it by providing new, more challenging monsters."
190363900,english,0,2246340,"This is being written before any of the game's major updates, about three weeks after launch. And it's being written by an insane old lady who started playing this franchise on her Playstation 2 in 2005, who cares about it more than she ought to. I also had a lot of fun in my 50 hours so far. Hitting 'no' on whether I recommend it isn't really a literal 'I do not recommend the game'. It also has nothing to do with the extremely valid criticisms of the game's extremely dogwater performance. Keep all that in mind.  I don't think my take on Wilds is going to be a popular one, even with as many critics as it's building up. Which is fine, I'm used to that, World is the first time I've actually agreed with majority consensus on this franchise, while before that I would have still insisted Unite was the best in the series. That isn't a popular take. But I really can't help but feel like Wilds has gone in a bad direction for the long-term health of the series. Not because of the shorter hunts or the 'lack of content' that you may have already heard complaints about, especially that latter one. I DO think there's some truth to it, I think even at launch World had a lot more to do, but zero question that perception is mostly from people remembering World in its final state.  My issue is that this game feels completely frictionless. The game doesn't feel like it ever stops me, it doesn't feel like it ever trips me up. Everything is so easy to do, not just the fights but supplies and food and inventories and unlocks and layered gear and, just everything. Your mount automatically sends you to where you need to go and everything you'd ever need is put in your pocket then the big monster dies after tapping you on the wrist a couple times and that's that. Even that example I gave before, there's just as many palico gadgets and we obviously still have a mount, but you just kinda. Get them. I didn't have to explore some weirdo unmarked nook of the map to do a weirdo unmarked quest for some random unmarked cats, I just kinda got it. Everything is laid out for you, handed to you.  There's good and bad to the friction being gone. I love that sharpening is actually possible to do mid-fight solo now, but I feel like it's too generous that my seikret can just pick me up to bail me out of anything at all ever. I'm not going to miss Nergigante's 'roar which stuns you for long enough that you don't have time to sheathe your weapon to superman dive away from his now undodgeable attack' garbage, but I'm not sure I like that trade if it means NOTHING feels threatening. Nobody liked the old deco drop rates but... I dunno, it feels a little hollow finishing my build 50 hours into the game. Half of this stuff wouldn't be bad on its own, and half of it is actively good, but all at once? Remove ALL the friction, good and bad, at once? It makes it feel aimless, insubstantial, braindead. The game is so devoid of ANY sort of friction that I'm sitting over here feeling nostalgic about paintballs and mid-fight combining, for gods sake. Those were NOT good mechanics, but in a room full of padded walls I'm craving something concrete, something with some weight to it.  I think my biggest gripe - and I KNOW this take is going to be super unpopular - is focus mode. I just don't think I should be able to throw out attacks nonstop without thinking about them and relying on focus mode's 180s to trivialize positioning. To me, the essence of monhun is the need for commitment, for planning, the fact that having to consider so many things regarding monsters and your own movement and positioning in advance not only necessitated deeply learning monsters' behaviours, but rewarded you massively for it. Landing a TCS on a mobile monster used to be a thing of mastery and beauty and now it's just... Nothing.  The game honestly kinda feels more adjacent to Helldivers than World. A party game that exists purely for small groups of friends to roll loot slot machines in. And don't get me wrong, I like those kind of games, but that's not what monhun was to me.  Regardless of whether future monsters do more damage and take longer to kill, that won't change the fact that focus mode makes positioning nearly redundant, that every single weapon has get-out-of-jail-free moves, that the big moves just aren't hard to pull off anymore given they're either twice as fast or have super armour or both and even if you do screw it up completely you can roll out of it before it's even gone off, that your seikret ensures it's nearly impossible to get combo'd out, that the absolute worst the game can do is put up a Quest Failed screen and take away the 5 mega potions you used on the fight from your stash of 800.  I said at the start of this that I don't necessarily not recommend the game. But, at present, I would definitely recommend you to play World first. Too many edges got sanded down, I think. It's lacking the franchise's usual weirdness, and its abrasiveness. You can give the upcoming update monsters 10 times more HP, but it won't bring back the feeling of satisfaction that overcoming those rough edges brought.  In retrospect Monster Hunter Wilds is a very ironic name for something that feels so completely toothless.  EDIT: I did not expect so much attention on this, let alone for it to all be positive. Thanks for that! Especially the people sharing their old hunting stories, so, lemme share one of my own nostalgic hunting stories as thanks.  I still hadn't 'got' monhun when Unite came out, despite playing 1, 2 and F2. Nargacuga was the flagship monster for that game and I really liked (and still like) its design. I got the quest to hunt it, suited up with my trusty old Akantor armour, and decided on dual blades for it. One of my weaker weapons but it felt appropriate. And, like, what's the worst that could happen? I wasn't even in G Rank yet.  I drastically underestimated how tough a fight it would be, and wasn't nearly good enough with DB for it. I carted twice quickly just from being blindsided. I played safer from then but was still getting knocked around.  I went through my entire potion supply. I kept fighting but got low on HP and ran off to actually use the tent to heal (a lot of people didn't even know you could do that in the older games lmao), and do some old fashioned on-field procurement of potion materials, despite being unfamiliar with the new map. I hadn't had to do that since monhun 1. I thought about going home for the hammer but despite the struggle I was just... having fun. It really did feel like I'd just met something that was my match and I had to knuckle down and learn it.  I somehow managed to keep surviving, but the timer was becoming an issue. I'd barely even remembered quests had a time limit. I basically had no hopes for finishing it off, I was just keeping up the fight as practice. But I kept swinging when I could. Past 45 minutes I stopped going off to gather even when I fell into fatal range. And with literally less than a minute on the clock, it died. Out of almost all my supplies, battered and broken, hanging onto my last life by a thread, but I managed it.  It's still my favourite monster hunter memory. As Wilds is, it's really hard to imagine it making a story, and a feeling, like this. World gave me some similar ones with some of the nastier monsters. Most of those memories were from Iceborne, though, so I do still think there's hope for Wilds to turn out some great moments with AT patches or the inevitable expansion, but like I say in the review, patches can up the numbers but they can't make Helmsplitter satisfying again.  But also like I said in the review, I didn't really like the games between Unite and World much. It's not the end of the world if Wilds still winds up mid after everything. I waited 9 years between monhuns I actually liked before and I can do it again.  Happy hunting, y'all."
191600679,english,0,2246340,"Optimized mess. Modern games need to stop using new PC parts as an excuse, there are games that look 5x as better as this that released years ago and run on older computers completely fine."
191935978,english,0,2246340,"Too hard. Too many Apex monsters use a new attack called ""GENERATE CRASH REPORT"" that can't be dodged and can't be blocked. And ends hunt, bypassing all carts.  Would be a great game once this attack is nerfed."
189006148,english,0,2246340,"Ignoring the glaring performance and networking issues, I don't understand how you managed to make the multiplayer so bad after publishing Rise.   When the multiplayer works, it has the same problems as World, like needing to start quests solo, find the objective, watch a cutscene, exit the quest, and join a friend to actually play the game together.  Why? You already had a good system in Rise. If you're going to do sequences and cutscenes, let me at least bring a friend along.  Also, link groups are a stupid mechanic. Why is progression not tied to the lobby?   For the brief minutes where I do manage to fight the monster with friends, it's a really fun experience. This game may very well have the best combat in the series. I genuinely don't know why you designed the multiplayer this way.  Edit: A lot of you mentioned playing from a squad lobby, and it did make joining after the cutscene much more bearable, but I still don't like the game's singleplayer oriented design for the story quests, especially when Rise and GU story quests both work flawlessly with multiplayer. (Haven't played the older games yet)  Happy to report that non-story missions work with multiplayer almost flawlessly in Wilds. I'm hoping once my group reaches high-rank things will open up a bit more."
192286286,english,1,2246340,"Disclaimer: I played a ton of Monster Hunter so my thoughts come from that position. I'm not a 'purist' who outright dismisses modern MonHun, there's design decisions I have problems with but my focus is mostly on the product. I'm mostly comparing Wilds to World considering these are ""A team"" games (stuff like rise/sunbreak is the B team).  4 key points: Content, Performance, Story, Gameplay.  Content Is always iffy on new Monster Hunter releases. The games are being treated like Pokemon, with an eventual big update dlc/expansion basically making the game feel complete. This is one of the more unfinished feeling experiences I've had with Monster Hunter. I don't say this just from the wealth of Monsters to fight, Tri probably had less, but there's a lot of gaps particularily in the endgame. The fact that the open beta had you fight the de-facto final boss of the game is mad to me. I genuinely had my final boss fight before the game released, it was way harder too which was super satisfying once I beat it. The game is also pushing stuff that feels like it should be basegame into content updates. The first big content update is huge but it also definitely should have been there in the first place.   Performance sucks. The game took 0 lessons from World (And the A team worked on this prior). There's just no two ways about it. You can watch someones youtube footage on a 5090 and they still get texture pop-in. World had massive performance issues at launch and the ones here feel especially eggregious considering World probably is a better looking game too. Try the benchmark.  Story I'm only mentioning because of how forced it is. They definitely wanted to focus on it more this time around but the problem is that it's just not good. It's painfully formulaic and the twist in the middle actually made me laugh out loud with how silly it is. My multiplayer experience with friends was hampered multiple times by one of us having to go through a forced walk-and-talk that you cannot skip. I don't think a strong story would not work in a monster hunter, quite the opposite, but it's definitely not exploring anything interesting with the setting.  Your character this time is fully voiced and also a total badass during cutscenes right from the get-go. Very hard to immerse yourself that way. I cannot understate how egregious it is that your character is being treated like a newgame+++ gigachad from minute 1. Usually monster hunter treats your guy fresh meat straight outta the academy, and you earn your badass status by working your way through challenges. Nata (the kid) gets introduced as the surrogate protagonist because you need a character who is even remotely vulnerable to have some stakes. The confrontation with the final boss may as well have had linkin park playing with how badass/edgy the setup was.  Gameplay. Lotta things I could talk about here. There's plenty of smaller nitpicks between a really awkward multiplayer lobby system and questionable weapon balance, but if I had to summarize the biggest issue with Wilds it would be something like this: This is the Monster Hunter game where they want you to feel like a badass. Hunter movesets are far too powerful, Monsters did not compensate enough for this. You are consistently overpowering monsters at every stage of the game. As others have pointed out before, the game feels like you are beating low-rank monsters with high-rank gear. Hunter movesets were made to be a lot more mobile which is definitely fun, but it also means that positioning matters less. Why reposition for a big attack when you can just press the parry/counter that is completely reaction based, on a very very easy reaction no less. Parries definitely do not come at a premium in this one. A lot of talk was made about how the Seikret was an improvement over the wirebug from rise, but I think people underestimate how powerful the Seikret is. The game doesn't outright say this but you can get knocked down and still call your bird, completely saving you with plenty of invulnerability, making it functionally impossible to die given how calling it is free. This is by far the easiest monster hunter.  My guess is this is also why the Story treats you like a badass from the get-go. I think this is a deliberate decision by the devs. This is the game about the power fantasy of being a monster hunter, but it feels unearned if the challenges aren't really there (or your character does something badass in a cutscene).  The content and difficulty in this game are intertwined. The grind in Monster Hunter primarily functions as the endgame and replayability, giving you goals to do micro-optimizations to your gear, try different weapon loadouts, etc. Problem is they hand you everything way too quickly. An armorset can be completed in 2 hunts. Jewels you basically get shoved down your throat (and I didn't even do the farming exploit that was meta for a while). And why grind anyway if I'm already demolishing monsters. I don't really feel the improvements to my gear when fights are easy and they are still easy with better gear. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of the series, I'm not expecting to get challenged the same way here as I am with late-stage content of older games. But this is the only monster hunter where I just feel ""done"" with the game. I've seen it all.  The future for this game is a little iffy. They clearly shipped the game too early and are introducing more stuff with their scheduled content updates. I'm not certain they will fix core issues with the game however. They talk about looking into balancing and I certainly hope their 'careful language' there will bring the overall powerlevel of hunters down, but I doubt it.  I'm probably coming back to it once the big ""rise2"" expansion releases, but until then, as I said, I've seen it all. I would still recommend this game as an entrypoint for newcomers if you have the PC hardware to properly run it. It's still monster hunter. It's still fun with friends and all. But after finishing wilds we went back to revisit sunbreak and had a much better time overall."

Capcom you really showed those dirty repackers and pirates a lesson by locking me out of the game I paid you close to one hundred American dollars for. You really saved me there--I don't know what i would do if were able to play with my friends for the one game we have all been excited about for half a year. You know what? You're right I don't need friends anyway. Hopefully they will all get locked out too.

189044441,english,0,2246340,"[h1][b]Here's the most relevant reasons the game feels so bad until high-rank:[/b][/h1]  [b]1. Performance, and fidelity.[/b] Reasonable framerates on everything but the latest GPUs come at the cost of textures that look straight out of a ps2 game half the time. Why do my scoutflies look like minecraft particle effects when I'm not 2 inches from them? Why does having more than 2 entities on screen, or rotating my camera at all, cause stuttering? The difference in quality between this and other recent AAA titles is staggering. Wilds has such good designs and animations, which get severely neutered by the absolutely broken performance.  [b]2. Multiplayer cohesion.[/b] It is miserable to have to re-join a quest, only after someone has actively started the hunting portion of the quest, when you have played along the exact same questline. Not only that, even if you're playing in tandem, you have to ACTIVELY run away from the hunt you're trying to complete together in order to even re-join your friends, since the game gives you a connection error if you get hit by the monster you were immediately forced to fight. It's crazy that they managed to un-fix a problem I thought they'd resolved in other titles.  [b]3. Pacing.[/b] Good lord, it's miserable. Are you going to get a cutscene that forces you to leave the area immediately after a quest? Or maybe a dialogue sequence you have to skip through one message at a time? Or an unskippable auto-walk at the slowest possible movement rate on your seikret? After 2-4 of these, randomly chosen, you will be immediately thrust into a hunt that lasts all of 5 minutes. Repeat until the credits roll.  [b]4.  Difficulty.[/b] Worlds and Rise both had significantly harder monsters than anything in Wilds. They have tiny health pools that make it so you barely engage a monster before it's dead. Their attacks do negligable damage that is healed with 1 potion (or better yet by your palico which you no longer have any choices to make regarding their tools), and there's no threatening follow-ups to the monster attacks on the off-chance they even get you low enough to care. Wounds spawn constantly, and borderline stunlock monsters when you proc them. I never, ever felt anything that could qualify as a challenge, not even on the final boss, and so I felt like I had to rush the game to even have a chance at enjoying any gameplay, because HOPEFULLY high-rank is a little less trivial.  [b]5. Exploration.[/b] There is literally no reason to do any exploring, at all, ever. The closest you could get to an incentive would be for pop-up camp locations. Your seikret transports you to all but two destinations automatically, and the entire map and all of it's resources are revealed. There's no gameplay-driven reason to hunt for anything, and it is so sad because the artists put tremendous work into the scope and detail of the world, and the monsters, and the environments, and it all gets wasted because you're never made to gather monster tracks, or do an expedition, or hunt for gathering spots.  When you combine all of these factors, you get a game that feels like it's trying to say [b]""Hey, actually, please don't engage with me until the postgame, because every single system I'm built on is working together to make the process of getting there nothing but a chore.""[/b] It's insane how many systems they discarded that validated the entire experience of Monster Hunter. God, I hope high-rank has some challenge to it at least. It's unforgiveable how badly they designed this game in totality. Bless the artists, and the combat designers, but every director in charge of the rest of the game should be ashamed of the experience they've provided us."

It was fine in the 1st beta, but since the 2nd beta it has been causing crashes, freezes and insane FPS drops for me. - Without the frame generation, the game runs quite poorly on RTX 4070Ti. The optimization is absolutely horrible. - Enabling highest resolution textures causes constant pop-in, despite GPU having more than enough memory to store textures. What's the point in offering ab optional high-quality texture pack as a DLC if texture streaming is so broken?   I'm sorry, but I am done giving publishers a pass simply because I like their games.

189462918,english,1,2246340,"[h1]Preface[/h1] Ever since our beloved series reached the eyes and ears of rest of the world, Capcom has made a valiant effort to keep Monster Hunter titles in check with various innovations to keep the series fresh and appealing to a wider audience. Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.  In this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I'm not even looking at you this time, Rise. You're third place no matter what.  [h1]Positives[/h1] [b]Core Gameplay[/b] The core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I've been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it's all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we're all here for it.  [b]Multiplayer & Questing[/b] The lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn't hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I've seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don't see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to ""load in"" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of ""not taking us out of the immersion.""  [b]The Monsters[/b] The bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren't as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don't seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an ""identity"" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.  [h1]Negatives[/h1] [b]Repetitive Flow - For the first time ever[/b] Although the weapons feature numerous ""gimmicks"" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don't get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what's with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...  [b]Items and Builds - Unnecessary?[/b] I have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I'm almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don't really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.  [b]Lack of Central Hub[/b] The number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!  [b]Bland Story[/b] If I don't mention this category, I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with ""Acknowledged"" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] [b]Final Verdict: 8/10 B[/b] Although the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn't a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state. As I mentioned in the preface, Wilds is more of the same in this humble veteran's eyes, and you can sit comfortably in front of your screen and take heart in knowing that even if you don't buy it now, the game isn't going anywhere. The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the ""gotta play the new game"" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven't tried it yet.  Better yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal. One final note in that regard: aside from the achievement that requires online hunting, I still prefer to solo everything without any issue just because I want get those focus attacks in without interruption. Who knows? You might feel the same way, fellow hunter."
189435988,english,0,2246340,"Extremely fun gameplay but cant recommend in its current state.  Exploding polygons/vertices, horrible texture pop-ins, network errors galore. Generally horrid optimization.  There are also some bugged skills that currently do not work with Heavy and Light Bowguns  Burst - Only boosts raw and not elemental Flayer - Doesn't make it easier to create wounds Partbreaker - Doesn't increase damage of focus strikes  Elemental Ammo Tick Rate: Capping your FPS to 35 or 144 FPS gives you more Elemental Ammo Hits (7 instead of 5)   Info taken from Phemeto's latest video on Bowguns   Also a certain gigantic ice monster sometimes gets stuck between arena transitions and vibrates rapidly for a few minutes before it finally gets itself unstuck from the terrain.  If you have a good enough PC or are ok with some frustration along the way its a great MH game. Will change review once Capcom (hopefully) fixes these issues."

188932474,english,0,2246340,Gameplay is great but the optimization is terrible. Frame gen should not be a requirement to hit 60fps. I've played games that look a lot better than Wilds and they ran so much better.
188915753,english,0,2246340,"Absolutely atrocious performance for how the game looks. Runs even worse than the beta. For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. The game does not look nearly good enough to warrant this performance. Everything is covered in a grimy texture with assets that look like you straight took them out of a PS3 game. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this. Embarrassing. Wait for a sale and/or optimization updates. I've played games on my Deck that look better than this. When I was kid I couldn't believe how good MHFU looked on my PSP, an entire world in my hands. And now they release a game like this. It saddens me the mediocrity that Capcom has fallen into. But what do I know, maybe I'm just a little silly billy and my 4070 toaster is just outdated at this point. Guess I'll go back to playing better looking games on ultra."
189138464,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. I have 3000+ hours across the recent titles. I played World/Iceborne on Playstation and then PC over again when the PC versions launched. I did the same for Rise/Sunbreak.  I want to preface that I've finished the main story & beaten every monster the game has to offer.   This game, wholeheartedly, is a downgrade in almost every aspect when compared to the previous titles. It's ""OK"" - but there's a lot of things that are just... bad decisions. They'll sell ""fixes"" through an expansion, like they did with Rise, but it's still NOT GOOD in the current state.  We lost SO many quality of life changes. ---------------------------------   Graphical downgrade and terrible optimization. The game looks brown. Everything looks brown. There's filters/settings enabled that just makes it look *bad* - Sometimes, like in the lush forest, it looks incredible when the fog is off... but everywhere else it looks washed out. The FPS is awful (There's a typo in the config file you can fix to add a little more) and you will struggle to get over 60 FPS on average/decent computers.  No idea what happened in testing.  ---------------------------------  Multiplayer is terribly implemented. There's lobbies, link parties, environment links, and a billion other things you need to juggle just to play with people. We seriously went from >make lobby >join lobby >post quests and play... to whatever this is. Even if you're IN THE ENVIRONMENT LINK WITH FRIENDS you still get disconnected sometimes after defeating a single monster. It makes no sense.   You're forced into 'cutscene gates' where you can't do things with people until you see certain things.. something that was FIXED in World because it was SO HATED AND ANNOYING. It's back! Playing with friends is ROUGH until you're at the end of the game.  ---------------------------------  The game is incredibly theme-parky and ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES exploration. You are tethered to certain areas while doing any story mode missions. World encouraged vertical exploration and players to go around on their own, but on here everything is listed, shown, and auto-pathed to by your mount.   There is no central hub, so it feels like you're constantly jumping around ""exhibits"" to find NPC's, quests, turn things in, and do whatever. It's very broken up, sparse, and feels incredibly clunky and jarring to navigate compared to the previous two titles (and even older ones). I guess they're adding a central hub eventually but didn't have enough time? Sucks.  It feels like they took Frontiers and mutilated it, trying to have an ""MMO FEEL"" without any MMO mechanics. I cannot tell you the number of times I've had to look everywhere to find where to turn in quests.   Even things like MAP MARKERS for camps are buried by other markers IN CAMPS and they're really difficult to see/fast travel to. The way the list of camps were shown in World made it *brain dead easy* to find... How did we go to this?  ---------------------------------  The story is very bland. I'd even say that it's awful. I won't go into spoilers or specifics, but there's absolutely no ""big catastrophe"" you're trying to avert or anything major that's being built up to.   Most of the dialogue is patronizing, condescending, or very ""life is special"" - and it just rings really hokey. There's also not even a dragonator anywhere in the entire game. I'd put it on the same level as ""base"" Rise's story, which says a lot.  There's very few memorable characters, moments, or anything along those lines. Part of what makes some of the story of the previous titles so good is how extra and over the top some of the characters are. Again, no dragonator moments.  It can also be completed in less than 10 hours without rushing. It just kinda.. ends.  ---------------------------------  The experience feels soulless. I dunno how else to put it other than feeling like nothing is inspired, and more like everything was ""lets do this again"" in Wilds. It feels like there was no vision beyond ""Make another World game"" and Capcom executives yelling at the developers to do so. The phrase I've heard a LOT of friends using (who are veterans of MH far longer than I am, since the original) is that it feels *incredibly* corporate.  You kinda just get it as a vibe. As you play through, the longer you play through, you'll understand what I mean.  ---------------------------------  Monster variety is very limited, and there's nothing really ""stand out"". Even the flagship monster is uninspired compared to previous title flagship monsters. Going through the entire game, killing every single monster available, I cannot think of a single one that impressed me or made me go ""woah"" on the same level of things like Vaal Hazak, Velkhana, Malzeno, Xeno'Jiiva, etc had to offer. It feels like you're fighting three archetypes the entire game.  A lot of monsters are repeats from previous games, including the movesets and skeletons (which have been used on a few of the new ones), which is a bit disappointing considering how few actually exist.  I'm actually worried about future content because most of the announced monsters are just filler/mid tier monsters... and the game's already done. The escalation wont be there unless they add things like Alatreon, etc, alongside smaller threats.  ---------------------------------  There's no endgame. You farm two or three tempered monsters at the end and that's it. There's no carrot on a stick to pursue and you'll be done as a dedicated player within a few days.  I won't go into extreme detail but yeah, nada.  ---------------------------------  Decorations are really weird now. Most attack based ones can only be put on weapons (Such as ballistics, etc), which means only 3 slot weapons can fit them. Three slot slots on armor/etc CANNOT wear the same decorations as weapons. This severely limits builds. Most armor sets also are just *incredibly* lackluster when it comes to skills provided.  I get this limits player power but.. it just feels really clunky on how they did it.  ---------------------------------  The entire new wound system is just clutch claw from Iceborne but way more auto-pilot. You do huge amounts of damage while wounding, get free materials, and CONSTANTLY KNOCK DOWN MONSTERS from applying wounds. There's fights you're going to do later once you're geared where monsters cannot get up off of the ground.   People complained about the clutch-claw gameplay and this is just the exact thing.. but WAY more  overtuned and broken. Even the hardest monsters the game has to offer kinda get destroyed by any sort of wound mechanic.  ---------------------------------  The food system is a downgrade. I get what they were going for but in simplifying it they've made it kinda awful. Getting materials sucks, the stores that sell/offer ingredients only seem to give you rations, and the bonuses from food are lackluster. We went from having major defense up, attack up, ammo conservation, and all these other awesome things to just basic buffs.   NOT TO MENTION THERE'S NO PALICO CUTSCENES FOR FOOD COOKING. RIP Grandma food cat.  ---------------------------------  The camera is awful. Monsters are bigger than your screen and tracking is bad. Can't count the number of times later that bigger monsters are just 95% of your screen and you can't see what they're doing fast enough. Even at max zoom/focus it's a downgrade from World.  ---------------------------------  I *want* this game to be better than it is and I know they'll make it better in the future, but man, I wouldn't be surprised if I see lots of people going back to play World/Iceborne after a couple of weeks of Wilds.  Monster Hunter fans will still find enjoyment in the game but the entire way through you'll probably be thinking ""I miss this"" or ""This is clunky"" or ""This was done better"" - and that's just sad to me."

Exploration and becoming familiar with a location, its details and secrets were given similar importance to learning the behaviors and patterns of the monster you hunted because of how they - and you - are intertwined. Your understanding is personal and ropes you into feeling part of the world. Since environmental hazards came out, this saw explicit gameplay reward too.  3) [b]Tracking.[/b] Before World it was your way to secure your combat reward for good scouting, with light management because paintballs wore off. World made it an additional reason to engage with the environment; how well it was done is up to interpretation.  4) [b]Combat and chase.[/b] Self explanatory. The meat of the game and main reward for locating the target monster.  You may notice these are simplified steps to actual hunting.   [h3]So which of these are attacked exactly?[/h3]  [b]Scouting:[/b] Immediately knowing where everything is defeats the need and incentive to explore. How the hell are we expected to care for cool spots we never discovered ourselves? Stray too far and the game yanks you away for daring to look at something new. Somehow they removed joy and wonder from higher tier environment design. At least they let us physically ignore 90% of the world by holding a button to laser focus on text in the most braindead iteration of gathering to ever grace us.  [b]Tracking:[/b] This is what's removed outright, replaced by the tacky magic objective marker. Tracks still exist but only give you currency. Scout flies became useless by World's endgame so that's why? [b]Well there's a clear rework they could've done:[/b]  Believe it or not sneak attacks and bushes exist as afterthoughts to some basic stealth system. If they wanted to remove tracking, [b]why wasn't the level design built with engaging stalking in mind, where some monsters only stayed to fight or could lose their special power if we snuck up on them first?[/b] What if our ""intelligent"" seikret could be taught to help with this? Why didn't they replace scoutflies with the raptor following scents?   Wanted to keep the flies and tracking anyway? Have them trained to only follow monsters tagged by paint for the whole hunt. Ruin hiding tactics or some amazing camouflage that's hard to see with the naked eye. It's reason to care about rain too.  Right now, only having prep for battle sounds like a glorified boxing ring. [b]""Monster Brawler"" is not the name of the series.[/b]  [h3]Anything else of value?[/h3]  Each of these are so far absent:  -Home customisation -Endemic life as pets -Mounts engaging in combat -Collectables -Raids  Cooking skill variety is pretty sad compared to every other game too.  MH games always offered 'extra'. (Raids would need improving)  [h2]But the combat's still good, right? How does this affect me?[/h2]  [h3]Lazy choices disrespecting core identity lead to lazy choices disrespecting you and this is present throughout. Not just in boring navigation, backwards menus or some nightmare 4-5 steps with recursive loop to playing multiplayer with friends. So how does combat fare...?[/h3]  [h1]Low Rank is Hell.[/h1]  The mind-numbing kind.  1) [b]A top complaint is hunts being too short.[/b] The devs failed to develop a new, fun, gameplay buildup to engage with before fighting, nor have they balanced the combat to really let you partake in this part's stellar system. 5-10 minutes when hours deep is immensely dissatisfying. It's a potato chip experience: tastes great but is gone too soon. Rise and World got it just right.  2) [b]Build crafting.[/b] Decorations are segregated on whether they're a 'weapon gem' or 'armor gem', removing creative slot management and the satisfaction of optimal builds how [i]you[/i] wanted. Very old games would add to one skill and take from another. Balancing that prevented OP builds better than this restrictive, over-corrective mess.  3) [b]Then there's the story.[/b] World let you breathe - Wilds crushes your windpipe. Progression for ~75% of your first 8-16Hrs is stuck in the most shallow, uninspired nothingburger drivel, forcibly handholding you throughout it all. Some interesting lore and that's it. Frequent are shacklings to tiny spaces just in case you wanted to - God forbid - play the game. Combine how [i]short[/i] the hunts are and the bore drills deep.  [h2]So what's the recurring problem here?[/h2]  [h3]Everything is designed to stop you engaging with the game, both implicitly and explicitly. Going so far as to hollow the experience out and prescribe you a narrow vision on how to interact until finally opening up by endgame. Dozens of hours in.[/h3]  Unlike any other MonHun, you can't really look, learn or enjoy outside combat. Minimal side content. Constant nags on where to go, where to stand, who to speak to and when play's allowed between each. And every. Quest... Sounds like a school - that fun to you?  And it's tragic because there are cool, fun little details with beauty to witness. Again, combat is fantastic. But for all these efforts to make the game worth playing, someone in Capcom's out of touch management either refused to let the game cook or stirred the pot, thinking MH as 'just another action game' when the legs are built on so much more. Now sloppy and missing features encroach on what gives it character.  World:Iceborne remains king. Sunbreak is queen."

188939251,english,0,2246340,"AMD BEWARE  I generally dislike leaving negative reviews when a game just released because I'm afraid it'll seem like jumping on the ""hate the popular thing"" bandwagon etc. However. The perfomances are one thing I can ignore, it doesn't run good but it runs well enough on my machine, I can wait for updates for that  What I cannot ignore however is the inability of the game working on top of the line AMD GPUs, I have a 7900XT and the game crashed on startup, until I figured I had to turn on WINDOWS 7/8 COMPATIBILITY MODE IN THE EXECUTABLE PRORIETIES   And that's where the huge problem lies, if you turn on Comp mode, half of the textures shit themselves, I'm not talking about a lttle artifact here and there, I'm talking about a MASSIVE artifact covering the ENTIRE screen as soon as there's a rock in frame, this is unnacceptable especially for the flagship product of a company  And you cannot turn it off once you booted, you'd think maybe the issue was shaders compiling, or something But no. Turning off comp mode brings the game back to crash on startup  I still put up with it considering it's either that or no monstie at all, but the review is a solid negative and will stay as is until the problem get hotfixed.  AMD BEWARE unless you're ready to have your eyes bleed. For now at least.  Those armour sets are banging though."
189223176,english,0,2246340,"This might get drowned out by all the reviews about performance, but there are many issues I had with the game past that.  Difficulty: I used pc controls and the lance for the first time for my playthrough and didn't even need to craft armor until Guardian Doshagama, going from 11 defense to 131. From there it was a cake walk just by using what random materials I had from doing quests, even beating a tempered Arkveld right after beating the main story with no problem still using random bs. I understand wanting to make a game accessible to all skill levels, but doing it to this degree gives most players no reason to interact with the open world at all during the story, and considering the lack of postgame, basically invalidates the open world as a whole.  Weapon and combat changes: Counter reliance is bad for monster hunter, and every weapon has some form of counter in this game, with certain weapons revolving around spamming counters now. Plus, certain overtuned attacks have made some weapons lose nuance in gameplay, and in conjunction with wound attacks, makes the combat feel really spammy. Also, the combination of wounds, clashes, and offsets really thrashes the monsters around, making even returning threats feel more pathetic than ever. The majority of combat changes seem to prioritize making the game more cinematic and satisfying over giving it mechanical depth, which I can enjoy for one game, but I hope that design philosophy is a one time thing. [Additional minor nitpick: what kind of logic makes wounds go away when you hit them, and makes it so you can only do certain combos if you start them by hitting a wound?]  Content and pacing: I beat every main quest, side quest, and monster available at launch in 27~ hours of gameplay, and I wasn’t really in much of a rush. What’s arguably worse is that you pretty much fight the final boss in low rank, and the entirety of high rank feels like postgame, with its final fight being a rematch from low rank. Then, there is basically no actual post game other than fighting a handful of tempered monsters harder than what you get from doing the main high rank quests.  Monsters: The new monsters are fine. Since it's a subjective topic, all I care to mention is that the movesets of some seem shallow, and many of their moves plus the new moves given to old monsters seem poor at indicating the direction and space they’re gonna take up. I also think they lack the charm found in many classic monster hunter monsters, but that can be applied to monsters from rise and world as well.  The environment: It's decent, which is devastating in comparison to how amazing the locales were in world. Not including graphical issues, it can be ugly and dark and boring at times, but can certainly be beautiful, especially in the ruins. However, the level of creativity pales in comparison to the fantastical coral highlands and rotten veil. Even the clever use of every single imaginable shape and form of ice in the hoarfrost impressed me more than anything shown in this game. Plus, the endemic life was kind of lame, with many of them being slightly altered, real world lizards. Also, having to catch something for a quest that I already caught previously was annoying.  My general opinion: This game is deeply disappointing to me, not because it's objectively bad, but because I expected much more. It seems like they learned from the feedback given to world, but forgot a lot of what they did to make that game as good as it was in the first place. Also, as I was playing, many aspects of the game seemed like a collection of many good-but-underdeveloped ideas, lacking the depth and attention to detail I was looking forward to from this team. Aside from negative feelings, I was able to make a decent amount of fun of it, but cannot recommend buying this game before beating the majority of worldborne."
192319039,english,0,2246340,"What's so strange about this game is, they've sanded it down with the intent of finding an even broader audience, but the result would be mystifying to me if I was a new player. The game picks a healing item for me automatically, so what is the point of the plethora of different healing items? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) Sharpening my weapon just amounts to pressing a button whenever I remember it, so what is the point of the sharpening mechanic? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) You can beat any fight with any equipment, so what is the point of all these complicated weapon stats? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) It feels like, if Capcom were designing this game from scratch, 75% of these systems wouldn't even be in it. Because they all add friction and Capcom doesn't want there to be any friction any more. In that sense, it's kind of a mess.  Beyond that, the point about the equipment sums up how Wilds has broken the loop that made previous MH games so satisfying (already an issue in Rise but absolutely terminal here). Your impetus for hunting the same monsters again and again is supposed to be that you NEED those materials to win your next fight – and you need to master your weapon for the same reason. But in Wilds none of that matters. I will admit that combat feels great. But WINNING doesn't feel great, because it's no longer the culmination of anything except mashing buttons. The reason I want a real challenge isn't to prove how skilled I am, it's because a challenge makes you engage with the game more deeply, and so gives you a richer, more sustained experience, which you think about even when you're not playing. Without that, you're left with a nicer-looking but much shallower retread of Monster Hunter World, and that hasn't been worth £60 to me. And even if they redeem it to an extent through title updates and DLC, that won't restore purpose to all these legacy mechanics that now drag behind the game like a dead limb."
190858070,english,0,2246340,"It's a fun game. The combat feels nice. The new monster designs are all awesome, and the game's open world has serious potential.  But the frog has been boiled. What started as ""Quality of Life"" changes in World have slowly morphed the series into something totally different than what I think of when I think of Monster Hunter. So many legacy mechanics feel like they're in the game due to obligation. The Seikret trivializes mid-hunt maintenance, I had basically unlimited Mega Potions, Barrel Bombs, anything I needed, and without the need to gather materials or craft much. No more tracking. Wounding makes Hit-Zones irrelevant. The game does everything in it's power to push you back into combat,  which is also easier than it's ever been and is no longer about thoughtful positioning and commitment. Just sit on your Seikret and let it autopilot you to your destination. I did not fail a single quest my entire play-through. I had fun, but I am sad to see the series give up on it's own identity."

Dragon's Dogma incident repeated. You do not deserve the love from the MH community Capcom. You do not.   After more hours i keep my review negative as people think it would change anything. No. Game looks like ass, runs like ass. Shimmer cause by dlss, frame generation on ground, can't run in native resolution without AI upscalers.

189505316,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is a great game ... just not yet and hopefully with some updates my review might change.  The Good  Let’s start with the positives. Visually, Wilds is stunning. Its environments are beautifully crafted, and the combat remains impeccable, carrying forward the deep, rewarding mechanics that define the series. The thrill of the hunt is still here, with weapons feeling satisfying to use and monsters providing exhilarating challenges.  The fishing is also kinda cool now. (Yes, that’s actually a highlight.)  The Issues  However, despite its strengths, Wilds stumbles in nearly every other aspect. Performance has been unnecessarily poor for many players, and while optimizations will likely come in future patches, they won’t fix the game’s more fundamental problems. Wilds takes multiple steps back from the series' core identity, creating an experience that is frustratingly obstructive and unfinished.  UI and Navigation  The user interface is a mess. Something as simple as adding a friend without joining the same lobby is an ordeal. The game’s multiplayer is somehow more obtuse than World’s already clunky system, requiring unnecessary steps just to play with friends.  The HUD is cluttered with unnecessary markers and information overload, stealing attention from the world and combat. Instead of immersing players, it bombards them with visual noise that detracts from exploration.  Loss of Core Monster Hunter Identity  Monster Hunter has always been about preparation, scouting, tracking, and finally engaging in combat. Wilds strips away these core gameplay elements in favor of shallow, modern open-world tropes.  Scouting is undermined by objective markers that tell you exactly where everything is, removing the joy of discovery.  Tracking is gone, replaced by an ever-present magic marker that directs you to your target without effort.  Exploration is actively discouraged, as the game yanks you back if you stray too far.  Combat, while still strong, is hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of hand-holding.  Rather than enhancing the experience, these changes reduce Monster Hunter to a streamlined action game, stripping away the depth that made past titles special.  Low-Rank Experience and Story  Early-game progression is a slog. Hunts are too short, often lasting only 5-10 minutes, making combat feel rushed rather than rewarding. Build crafting has been oversimplified with restrictive gem slotting, eliminating the creativity and satisfaction of optimizing a setup.  The story, meanwhile, is both forgettable and frustratingly intrusive. Unlike World, which gave players room to breathe, Wilds constantly shackles players with excessive handholding, preventing them from engaging with the game on their own terms. The first 10 hours feel like a prolonged tutorial, suffocating any sense of freedom.  What’s Missing?  Many beloved features from past games are either absent or underwhelming:  No home customization  No endemic life as pets  No meaningful mounts in combat  No significant collectibles  No raids  Cooking lacks variety compared to previous titles  These missing elements further dilute the experience, making the world feel emptier and less engaging.  The Verdict  Monster Hunter Wilds has immense potential. Its combat remains excellent, and its world is breathtaking. However, its misguided design choices, frustrating UI, lack of core Monster Hunter elements, and poor pacing make it a difficult game to recommend at launch. If Capcom can address these issues through updates and expansions, Wilds could eventually become a worthy successor to past titles."
189796037,english,1,2246340,"The game's optimization could use some work. Frame rate drops and occasional stuttering are present even on high-end systems.

Despite the optimization issues, MH Wilds is still a fantastic title and worth checking out."

190185699,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds had a lot to live up to, especially after the success of World and Rise. After spending over 60 hours in the game, I have a lot of thoughts. Some things are fantastic, others are frustrating, and a few are just downright disappointing.  At its core, Wilds is still a Monster Hunter game, which means the thrill of the hunt is there. The weapons feel great, the monsters are well-designed, and the gameplay can be really fun. But… there are some major issues that hold it back. So let’s break it down.  Gameplay - Fun in Its Own Way Monster Hunter Wilds delivers a solid gameplay experience that feels unique and engaging. Despite its flaws, I find myself enjoying the core mechanics, and there’s definitely a lot of potential here.  Weapon Improvements - A Step Forward One of the best things about Wilds is the weapon system. Every weapon feels like a refined and improved version of its Monster Hunter World counterpart. The movesets, mechanics, and overall polish make them incredibly satisfying to use.  Combat - Slow and Clunky Compared to Rise Coming from Monster Hunter Rise, the combat in Wilds feels painfully slow. Rise had a level of fluidity that made the hunts exciting and dynamic, whereas Wilds feels sluggish in comparison. It doesn’t even come close to the sheer fun factor I experienced in Rise.  Multiplayer - No Real Sense of Community Technically, there are plenty of ways to communicate, but the problem is nobody does. The game doesn’t naturally bring players together for multiple hunts; instead, it has this vague ""join a party"" option, which almost nobody uses.  Right now, it's basically: play with real-life friends or hunt alone with randoms who join through the SOS system. There’s no real way to meet new players organically, no sense of community where you can team up for an entire evening, discuss tactics, or just chat about real life. The old hub system encouraged bonding and teamwork—Wilds completely lacks that, and it really hurts the multiplayer experience.  Graphics - Unacceptable for the System Requirements The visuals are an absolute disaster considering how demanding the game is. It feels like a downgrade from Monster Hunter World—everything looks blocky and grainy. At first, I thought it was an issue on my end, but after checking the forums, I realized this is a widespread problem. For a big company like Capcom, this is just unacceptable. My PC is well above the recommended requirements, yet the game still looks underwhelming.  Modding - Almost a Necessity As it stands, mods feel like a requirement to make the game look decent. The fact that the community has to step in and fix visual issues that shouldn’t exist in the first place is frustrating.  Typos in the Config Files?! This one is just baffling. There are actual typos in the config .ini files. It’s a small issue, but it speaks volumes about the lack of polish in some areas.  Final Verdict Despite all its issues, the gameplay itself is REALLY good. But right now, it just barely makes up for the game's many shortcomings. Capcom needs to step up and fix these problems, because as it stands, Wilds is a flawed but enjoyable experience."
189122412,english,1,2246340,"This is my first monster hunter game. I spent about 20 hours in the various beta tests. during my time in the beta tests i went from saying ""i've decided this game isn't for me"" to being one of the ones who stayed up way too late on launch night to finally get to play it again. It took me a bit of time to get accustomed to the controls and figure out how to use my character, but once i had it, it hooked me.  is it a perfect game? no. it has its problems. but for the most part the problems are more nuisances than anything. To be fair, i have a fairly high end PC built in 2019, and i upgraded my graphics card to a 4080 a couple years ago. I haven't had any problems with performance so far. i feel bad for those that are having issues, but my experience has been virtually flawless.  Since this is my first monster hunter i can't really compare it to older monster hunter games. I will say that so far i have enjoyed learning the combat, learning monster patterns and finding new tricks and traps along the way. I have not completed the game, so i have not started into end game, but i don't foresee many problems in end game for my type of play. i don't mind grinding games. i have nearly 700 hours into granblue fantasy relink on PS5 and 200 - 300 in granblue fantasy relink on steam. i enjoy grinding and getting more powerful. so i anticipate the end game will be just fine for me. i will edit my review if that changes.  the couple of problems i have with the game are fairly minor. i get tired of monsters running away. and sometimes running for miles before finally stopping; even when they are near death. it gets so old trying to chase them down as your fully healthy bird can't even catch up with something that is hobbling and stumbling away with broken legs and wounds all over it.  the other problem is with trying to get into a group with friends. the system is beyond complicated. private lobbies are not easy to use and very complex for your friends to try to join. link parties aren't well explained and make no real sense. squads seem to be something akin to guilds. my friend and i are greatly confused every time we try to pair up. joining a lobby with each other often leads to us not being able to see one another. also, even if we are in the same lobby we aren't able to do quests together, you need to be in a link party for that (maybe? since i really don't have a clue) so it's to the point where we join a squad, a lobby, a link party, and then start a quest. for quests in the storyline if you are trying to do the campaign together, you can fight the monsters as a pair, but its janky. when fighting campaign monsters whoever joins the other one gets sent back to the main camp and from there they have to run all the way to the monster to take part in the quest. a monster that is probably half dead by the time you manage to join their quest and load their version of the map and run from camp to the monster; very cumbersome.   i have no doubt that these things will be slowly ironed out over time. it's too bad they weren't solved before launch, but ultimately it doesn't take enough away from the game for me to stop playing it. i am completely enjoying my experience in monster hunter wilds so far and i look forward to putting in many more hours."

I have just submitted a refund request for Wilds, as even on fully LOW settings with DLSS performance mode my 3070/Ryzen 7 7800x3D/32gb 6000mhz build is not enough to reach a stable 60 fps in what is genuinely the WORST looking game I have played in recent memory. The game looks terrible. Which is honestly not a deal breaker, but it also FEELS terrible. Constant frame drops during hunts and in the village areas make what is already a poor experience an unplayable one. Even switching to FSR and enabling frame gen DOES NOT HELP, as I can peak 90 fps but still chug down to 30 when turning my character around, making the dips even more jarring.   Monster Hunter World looks gorgeous, miles better than Wilds, and runs at a rock solid 120+ fps, no dips, no stutters, no smeary PS2 textures, and no ai upscaling or generated frames.  Elden Ring, a beautiful open world game runs buttery smooth with visuals that put this game to shame.  Sadly both World and Elden Ring had performance issues at launch that had to be addressed through multiple patches, which seems to be the industry standard now. Hopefully the same happens with Wilds, but until then please DO NOT buy this game. Save yourself the time, energy, and money. I spent 2+ hours fiddling with settings and updating drivers for nothing.  I want to love this game, I really do, but in its current state I wouldn't play it even if it was free. Please do better Capcom"
189024025,english,1,2246340,"Aside from the optimization, this game is amazing. Hopefully they release a patch to optimize it so it isn't terrible for people without high end pcs. Runs fine for me, RADEON RX 7700XT and AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, but i can definitely see the bad perf on worse specs."
190519181,english,1,2246340,From the little time I've been playing MH Wilds I can say that i'm having a fun time hunting.  My enjoyment from the game reminds me and is comparable to when i played MH World I love both games but i do have to say that MH Wilds has its issues so i hope the issues get addressed sooner rather than later.   The game has so much potential and I'm excited for future monsters and collabs!!!
188977098,english,0,2246340,"Extremely promising game, but the performance and lack of optimization makes every form of good will garnered from the gameplay obsolete as the frame rate and stuttering is unbareable.   The recommended specs to run this game that the developers had provided is completely inaccurate and more accurately represents the minimum requirements to play the game. The recommended specs would get 30 fps on the best of days. With an i5-14400F, RTX 4060, and 64 GB of RAM this game STRUGGLES to maintain 60 fps and often sits at 45 fps on high settings at 1080p. Even lowering the graphics quality does not consistently improve frame rate."
189619533,english,0,2246340,"I really wanted this game to be good. I built a new PC primarily just to play this, so I won't speak of the performance issues as they didn't affect me at all. And there were also some positive things that stand out. Weapons feel smoother to play than ever, thanks to focus mode allowing to readjust where you are hitting, being able to skip the quest end countdown is something that was finally added as well, etc. But even considering that, there are just too many issues to wholeheartedly recommend the game.  My main grievances are:  1. Hunters have too much control. Thanks to the wound system basically adding a free stagger that any weapon can initiate at will so long as there is a wound makes the monsters look like clowns. Hunting Arkveld, the currently ""toughest"" monster in the game, is more akin to watching slapstick comedy. Between wound breaks, offset attacks, power clashes, flashes, regular topples, and natural traps if you use them, the monster spends more time on the ground or standing still than actively fighting. This also leads to hunts rarely taking longer than 10 minutes, usually averaging 7 at most.  2. Monsters are not dangerous anymore. If a monster does actually manage to break out of a hunters CC chain, it is till no threat. Be it the generally low damage of monster attacks, the lack of blights, wind pressure, and god forbid tremor (a literal landwhale belly flop and we don't get tremored standing next to it?), there's nothing a well timed offset attack of guard doesn't solve.  3. You cannot repeat the coolest fight in the game. [spoiler]You fight Zoh Shia once at the end of LR and that's it? No way to repeat the quest, no optional, no HR variant? We can't wear it's skin or use it's weapons? I'm sure i can hear the designers crying because they didn't get to make a nephilim themed armour with the whole Black and white theme going on in the fight.[/spoiler]  4. The absolute state of skills. I think the idea of taking a new approach to weapon and armour skills is nice. But the execution is severely lacking.  Locking certain weapons into a skill that is just objectively unusable on it is ridiculous (looking at you, crit draw lances).  But even if the skill would be usable, it might just straight up not work because a lot of them are bugged (e.g. Critical Element, Burst for HBG, ...). Locking a weapon into a specific skill is too restrictive either way in my opinion, but that's subjective.  5. The artian system feels very lacklustre. These weapons are the best in the game for the most part. The actual look of the weapons is at best mid though, especially compared to the other weapons in the game which are absolute peak design. And even if artian weapons have different elements, they all look the same. The way you build them as well feels very shallow and not engaging at all. It never makes sense not to go for element, there is no downside to just going 3 of the same element, you can't forgo element for a boost in raw/crit/sharpness or whatever. You always aim for the same thing. And when enhancing, you mostly just hope for a bunch of attack. And if you are unlucky, all you have to do is chuck the weapon into the ether and try again.  6. There is basically no endgame grind. The artian stuff feels like it was chucked on at the end just to have an excuse for an endgame. But in reality, parts are readily available from tempered quests that take no longer than regular hunts. If you are not planning on making a weapon of every type and element, you'll be done in no time at all. Same goes for decorations. It is obvious that the focus of grinding was supposed to be on something different compared to World. This in turn means, that getting all decorations is very quickly done as well, assuming RNGesus doesn't hate you. There is also no new mantles to unlock. You get a grand total of 4 thrown at you during the story and that's it. No doing all optional quests for a new mantle. Nothing.  While writing this review, I realised that some of these decisions may be to make the barrier of entry for new players to the series easier. But I feel like that is no excuse to leave existing fans of the series by the wayside. In World, i really enjoyed struggling with my friends to find a way to beat a certain monster, or a hunt coming down to the wire with 2 unfortunate carts. I enjoyed finding ways to make certain grinds faster with the variety of tools we had at hand. Finding something new to work towards way into the endgame. In Wilds, there's just nothing.  This game left a void in me. I was looking forward to it. I enjoyed playing through the story, albeit it feeling too easy, but I told myself ""Surely it will get harder in HR/Endgame"". And then I get to the end of HR. I beat Arkveld again. I am excited for what is to come when I hit HR50. What fight will be next? Will we get an elder dragon to fight? Zoh Shia again? What are these artian weapons preparing me for? And then ... nothing. I am left sitting in a mountain of unused relics, decorations and artian weapons. Okay, maybe it's HR60 this time around. I check. Nothing. There's nothing else to do. Hunt Arkveld 30 more times to reach HR100 to unlock more melding that I don't even need? That's it. That's the game done.  It may sound like I don't like the game. That couldn't be further from the truth. I still love the game, I see the vision, and I am looking forward to what the game will become in the future. But right now, I just cannot give the game a positive review. I will revisit this review once we see some more content and these issues addressed.  If you've read this far, thank you for tolerating my rambling. I'm done yelling into the void now."
189877669,english,0,2246340,"[h3]Not recommended with its current state (v1.0).[/h3]  It's a good game (not great). My overall rating is 7/10. Wait until Title Update 4~5 first before buying. Some points of the review is in comparsion with the base game World and Rise when they were first released.  First thing I'm gonna say is what I really like about the game. [list]     [*]Focus Mechanic - With Focus Aim you can freely aim anywhere now. This helps a lot especially melee weapons.     [*]Offset Attacks and Power Clashes - Great way of parrying monster attacks and addition to perfect guards.     [*]Slinger Gathering - No need to go the herbs and pick them up.     [*]New way of story progression. Not just: Hub - Post Hub Quest - Hunt. [/list]  With all the stuff below I hope all of them will get fixed and improve in the future updates!  [b]1. Optimization Issues.[/b] Game doesn't use the latest DLSS & DirectStorage versions for better and stable performance. For texture loading problems, it's as stated by one of the modders as well that capcom devs avoided using RAM/VRAM by streaming things when needed from storage instead of at boot time. All of these has been fixed by modders. And I hope Capcom will fix this on their side.  [b]2. Pop-Up Camps.[/b] There are a lot of QoL improvements but there are some changes that are questionable like the pop-up camps. What's the point of pop-up camps getting destroyed if you just need 75 points to fix them? And with the maps that are much larger than previous Monster Hunter games why not just make all the camps available and not have a limit of five. I do like that you can customize the camps now.  [b]3. Bad UX Design.[/b]  [b]First Alma (Quest/Lobby NPC)[/b] Before with the fixed Hub you always know where to go when you want to do a hunt or do something with the lobby. Because the NPC will not move and the NPC will always be there. Right now at least maybe more than half of the time since your Handler is the same as the Hub NPC, with her coming along with you on hunts, She will not always be beside the Base Camp Tent. She will most of the time walk around the Base Camp and you need to go look for her in order for you to interact with her.  [b]There is no bell sound anymore when someone posts a hunt in the lobby.[/b] Right now in order for you to get notified, when someone posted a hunt is through link party. Link party is good I'll be honest even when you are not in the same lobby you can still hunt with other link party members. But when you and your friends are in the same lobby and not in a link party there is no other way to know that someone posted a hunt aside from saying it through VC if you are in a call or manually typing it in game.  [b]Layered Armor/Equipment[/b] Back in MH World when we got Layered Armor you could link your layered armor set with the equipment loadout you are equipping. But now in order for you to change equipment appearance you need to get out of the Change Equipment and Navigate to Equipment Appearance. This is about 10 button presses average if your equipment appearance loadout is in the first page. Also for the Appearance Menu, they should move the Change Appearance below the Equipment Appearance because you will not always change how your character(face) will look. When changing equipment appearance, me and most people I know accidentally pressed this most of the time instead of moving down below first. For listed menu designs you will always put first the ones that will mostly be chosen to the least one.   In MH Rise the Layered Loadouts are in the Equipment Loadouts already. Even though they are not linked you can just switch between Equipment and Layered with LB/RB or L1/R1. They introduced Hunter Loadouts in Title Update 4 in Rise though. This is a loadout with equipment and layered link and an additional link for item loadout. This is really great especially for gunners since they have different ammos for different weapons.  [b]Raising Kinsect[/b] There is no Kinsect Tree. In order for you to know which Kinsect is better is after you nurture all of them. Back in World there are three tabs when you are crafting/updraging equipment and raising a kinsect. These are the list , tree and zoom view. Right now the one for Kinsect is default into a list view only.  [b]No Abandon Quest/No Mantle Reset on each Quest/Investigation[/b] I get that mantles will continue to cooldown when you are doing a Field Survey but when you are doing a specific quest or investigation from Alma the cooldown should reset. This specific review is not for everyone. But mainly who do speedruns or testing some things on a specific quest. The only available option now is ""Return from Quest"" and doing that uses up everything that you did during the quest (i.e. might pill or traps). You need to replenish the items everytime you do the run again. You also need to wait for the mantles to cooldown. Thus making it inefficient to do runs.   [b]No Copy Lobby/Hunter ID[/b] This is a simple feature to add and the Copy Session ID was already present in the Communication menu in World. There was also a shortcut key to view the Player List before in World when view the menu.  [b]Chat Log Notifications and how it disrupts viewing the Map[/b] The game taught us and it has always been the select key to view the map even from the previous game. In Wilds if there are monster notifications in chat, the select key will be the shortcut to skip the monster and to view the map you need to hold the start key. Every UX Designer knows that this is just bad for ""Navigation Familiarity""  [b]4. Story and Progression[/b] We all know that playing Monster Hunter games is always been the never ending hunting of monsters so I am fine with the story being so simple. I like how the story progresses now than before where you post the main story quest in hub and depart on the quest. I think they are moving close to a RPG type of main story progression with the maps connected to each other. And with locked out paths when you are being accompanied by NPC when you guys are riding a Seikret. And speaking of Seikret...  [b]5. Seikret[/b] Seikret AI is kinda junky at the moment. For sure this will be fixed in the future. Palamutes are the best. Change my mind.  [b]6. Endgame Stuff[/b] [table]     [tr]         [th]Game[/th]         [th]Deco[/th] 	[th]Talisman[/th] 	[th]Weapon Aug[/th]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]World[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]Selectable Augments[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Rise[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Selectable Ramp Upgrades, you can ramp up upgrades every weapon not only rampage weapons[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Wilds[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG, you can only reinforce Artian Weapons (Can save scum)[/td]     [/tr] [/table]  Right now base endgame hunting, there is only one monster that is worth hunting with the rewards. And that is mostly Arkveld. For full hunt rewards he will get paired up with a random monster and that is a way for you to hunt a different monster aside from him. Half of my saved investigations are Arkveld since other monsters don't have the same amount of rewards. The other half are those monsters with their Gem as rewards. But if you already crafted a lot of equipments that needs a monster gem. You will just go back to Arkveld.  Back in Base World you could always hunt almost every monster in High Rank since you are looking for Investigations with Gold Rewards and every monster investigation can have that reward. Also why couldn't we fight [spoiler]Zoh Shia again. There's no available investigation you couldn't repeat assigned quests.[/spoiler]  [b]Bounties.[/b] Before you could select bounties (optional subquests in Rise) that you want to do while hunting. And then choose a different bounty when you finish them. Now there is only Limited Bounty and they only reset weekly afaik."
190885605,english,0,2246340,"Never in my mind did I ever think I'd have to, at any point in my life, write a negative review for a monster hunter game. As a disclaimer - I am not a hater. I LOVE the franchise. Started back in Tri, buying the game completely by accident. Just by the art on the cover box, having no idea what I am getting into.  I fell in love with it, despite it's clunkyness and the game doing a poor job of explaining itself, but, by the time I finally fell my first Great Jaggi, I was hooked. The constant gameplay loop of killing a big monster, to make gear out of it, to prepare myself for yet another, even stronger monster - it's a magical code for my brain that keeps me coming back to this series.  BUT... It's not present in this one. Game has amazing fundamentals. The movement never felt this good. The weapon movesets have never been this fluid.  It's just a shame that all of it doesn't really matter, when the core aspect of a ""monster hunter"" game has been streamlined OUT of the game and now it's just a generic ""monster fighter"".  Where as the series started as a ""hunting expierience"" with player having to commit on every step, because there were stakes - now there are no stakes and no commitment. Before, you had to prepare your pouch for the hunt, carefully chosing items and stocking up on them. You had to position well during combat, because if you just go out swinging hands, at best you could whiff an attack and deal no damage, at worst you would get punished by the monster and get hit instead (and remember, your amount of potions on a hunt was limited, so you're being tested my friend).  Now, no matter if im running Dual Blades or Great Sword, as long as I am in range of the monster, it's gonna ALWAYS land, thx to the FOCUS mode, which ironically makes your brain lose focus, kinda zone out and let your hands just go through the motions. Feeling like you're fighting on autopilot, completely disengaged. Add to it the wound mechanic, which lets you stunlock the monster. The Palico that makes sure you don't have to bring healing items ever again and magically lays down a trap exactly at the moment that the monster is capturable. All those little things, and suddenly the game fails to provide any challenge. I could go on and on, but big content creators are finally catching up to what I've been heralding since World came out (because World started the trend, but wasn't nearly as sinful as this is) and they have already said everything.  Mechanics such as wind pressure, tremors, seem to not exist. They probably do but I finished all the content (which is not a lot if you skip all the cutscenes and if you COULD skip all the walkie-talkie sections) and I don't remember wind pressure/tremors or such things happening at all. Now - before you come at me, I did watch all the cutscenes, I didn't skip a single one of them, but my friend wanting to catch up to me, did, and he finished ""the story"" in 7 hours, where as I did so in around 20, and it's never a good sign if 13 hours out of your entire 20 for A GAME are filled with cutscenes.   I keep seeing these claims of the game's director that MH Wilds is a great success because of the story... No my friend. It's a great success despite the story, and mostly because World was a huge success. You are kind of getting the benefit of the doubt here, but you are quickly burning it.  This game has very little to do with what an actual ""Monster Hunter"" series was always about.  Expierience-wise: It's a game about hunting monsters, and as a hunter, preparing traps, tracking, doing what a hunter does. Gameplay-wise: Fight a monster, get it's parts, craft better armor, to be able to fight a bigger monster - that is what we would call ""gameplay loop"" in video game design, sadly, it's non-existant here.  Monster Hunter has lost it's soul and it's an extremly sad thing to witness. Because this used to be one of my most beloved things in the world, alongside Zelda, Mario, Metroid, all these big, passion-filled creations. And now, one of them is getting destroyed.   I might stick around to see Wilds getting it's G-rank expansion, but If the series doesn't change the course to revert some of it's streamlining, this might be the last monster hunter game I ever play."
188928667,english,0,2246340,"I was crashing a TON on a high-end rig, but changed my XMP profile in BIOS to normal, reverting my RAM to its normal speed, and the crashes are almost non-existent now.  Hoping they keep working on fixing performance issues so every hunter, old and new, can have a smooth and fun experience with this game, cus it is REALLY fun. Will change to positive after they address these glaring issues.  I think Wilds improves upon World in almost every way. The combat feels great with the new additions. The music and sound design are spectacular. Monster designs are REALLY cool so far. I don't care too much about the open-world aspect. It's kinda cool, but zones have always been fine. Almost out of low rank and looking forward to more monsters to fight! (pls let me put endemic life on display in a customizable house again PLEASE!!!)  Capcom, when will you stop adding so many hoops to jump through just to play with people!?"

However, it's impossible for me to leave a positive review for this game at its current state. It's probably one of the most unoptimized games in the last 5 years and Cyberpunk came out during this period. This speaks volumes! Capcom needs to pull their sh#t together and fix their game."
188913845,english,1,2246340,"""Monster Hunter Wilds: I'm Ready"" But RE engine is definitely not ready tho. Don't worry, even though it looks bad, at least it runs poorly. Trying to brute force RE engine into open world games clearly just does not work."

Such a shame because you can see the gameplay is there, the combat is there, the environment is there... would just be amazing if you could actually play it. I think a privately hired dude showing you each frame on flashcards as fast as he can be arsed to would give you a smoother experience.  Refunded and i'll be back when you make this obviously great game playable."
191400647,english,1,2246340,"[h2]Monster Hunter Wilds[/h2]  I have to say that I personally haven’t had any performance issues with the game. However, I acknowledge that I have a powerful system, and weaker configurations might struggle. Still, I can’t criticize the game for problems that I haven’t experienced myself. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3438993521 Just like with Dragon’s Dogma 2, I’m so happy to see a AAA project that isn’t running on Unreal Engine that I’m willing to forgive some of RE Engine’s quirks, even though it’s clearly not the best for open-world games. It’s a shame that developers like CD Projekt Red decided to abandon their own RED Engine in favor of the more popular Unreal Engine. Cyberpunk 2077 is literally the most beautiful game right now, while Unreal Engine games often look similar to each other. If you play them back to back, it sometimes feels like you’re playing the same game over and over again. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3437765725 As for Monster Hunter, the combat in this game is absolute cinema. There aren’t that many monsters yet, but the developers have clearly focused on quality. The fights feel well-designed and polished. The game itself plays and controls very well. I think they’ll improve performance over the year, and there’s no doubt they’ll deliver more content. Fans have shown massive support by buying a huge number of copies at launch, so Capcom has no excuse not to support the game - unlike Dragon’s Dogma 2 (which, unfortunately, probably won’t be getting any DLC). https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3436312302 The story campaign is fairly short and simple, but it does a good job of introducing newcomers to the game’s overall vibe. However, while they made things easier for newcomers in that regard, the co-op experience (group creation, frequent disconnects, and inconvenient rejoining) could really use some improvements. A more seamless co-op system would be great. Overall, the game is fantastic. The combat is exciting, though maybe a bit easier at launch (some mechanics have been simplified compared to Monster Hunter: World), but it’s still highly addictive!"
191390519,english,1,2246340,"This game feels like a fine dining experience—elegant, delightful, and entertaining, but also pricey and a bit lacking in portion size. Still, with frequent updates and improvements, it could remain fun and engaging for a long time."

191069105,english,0,2246340,"[u]This is a review from a veteran who started way back in MH3U and having played every single mainline/portable series ever since.[/u]  This is an unfinished game, unoptimized mess. With the developer intention of going mainstream the game just become way too easy with so much handholding in the early part of the game to the point that the difficulty is almost nonexistence and while still having an unchallenging endgame, being forced to jump through multiple hoops just to play with friends with the bloated co-op menu, monotonous and confusing map design, seriously i cant even memorized most of the map yet after 100 hours in and after already platinum'ed 200 hours later. make no mistake this is a still good game but seriously need more time in the oven for it to be great. in this current state i would say this game is still a ""premium"" beta. if ur new to the series and wants somewhat of a challenge go for World or if you really want a challenging experience go for Rise instead. Wilds is really just walk in the park.  p.s this review will be edited if the game gets better with updates in the future."
188998422,english,0,2246340,"Denuvo locked me out while I was troubleshooting start up crashes. Apparently, it counts every time you switch Proton versions as a separate installation. Thanks, Capcom, for using such an aggressive DRM!"
190336674,english,0,2246340,"The game is WILDly underperforming even on high-end hardware. Frankly, I have little to say that hasn't already been said by others. Performance aside...  1. There's a strange pivot away from the ""hunting"" aesthetic in this title. There's no more tracking, monsters are always seen on the map and you can automatically run to them (without any input, really). I can appreciate QoL that speeds up the game a bit, but these are key aspects that are required for proper gameplay pacing and made other Monster Hunter games feel the way they do. 2. The game is lacking some serious gameplay variety through features like the Private Quarters (from World). Because the pacing of hunts is already cranked to an all-time high, having nothing else to do makes the game turn into this boss rush with no meaningful breaks. To me this made it much easier to burn out on this game than on World. 3. I wouldn't expect an endgame given that there is no Master Rank yet, but I do want to point out that the game's existing endgame doesn't offer all that much. It's an upgrade from base World's endgame grind, but that's not saying much given how tedious World's was.  Overall, while it's a good new entry in the series, its problems currently vastly outweigh its strengths and I would recommend players to wait for updates. A lot could be done to address these concerns and I have high hopes that Capcom will listen to the players post-launch to release some much needed changes.  If you're still interested in playing the game, I'd say only buy the game if you're very certain that you can run it properly. The Benchmark tool, according to many, is not an accurate assessment of final performance, so do take it with a grain of salt.   I will change my review once Capcom has committed to addressing aforementioned issues."
188945286,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. World is one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay in this is good, because it's Monster Hunter.  However, if you aren't already a MH fan - I would stay away:  This game looks and runs like absolute dogshit. Actually, worse. It's pretty impressive that this team was able to take such INCREDIBLE assets like the character models, monster designs, and animations - just to take them all out back, smear them in horseshit and weigh them down with stones until they flatten into a miserable experience that is barely playable. With a 4070 and i7 14700kf 32gb of RAM I NEED to use a third party program (shout out Lossless Scaling) to make the game playable on medium settings. It looks HORRIBLE. The textures are muddied over from the (again, necessary) upscaling and everything turns into a ghosting mess. FPS will swing +/- 40 frames when nothing is happening at all.   Making the deliberate choice to use the RE engine for this after the absolutely abysmal fuckup that was Dragons Dogma 2 is fucking astounding to me. The level of disconnect between people who actually played this thing before launch and the reality in which we all live has reached a point that it should be studied by psychologists and philosophers alike as an example of incredible survival within a complete delusion and degredation of the mind. It's an affront to the effot of everyone who worked on rest of the game.   Don't plan on playing this with friends either, the system for joining and creating parties is, once again, a miserable and complicated experience that's buried within layers upon layers of disconnected menus and constantly changing hotkeys, with three different types of ""party"" for you to be in or out of at any time. If you are looking to pull up a friends list, hit ""invite."" and then start playing? Find a game that respects your time in that regard.  I know they still ""got my money,"" and I'm victim to ""I love thing and want thing so I'll play it anyway."" But companies need to stop releasing games like this. I don't think I'll be on board for another one. If you don't love Monster Hunter enough that you'll deal with hating yourself for this purchase because you just NEED IT - DO NOT BUY"

Absolute blast early game and the stories been pretty interesting so far, just beat Chapter 1. As always, the quest for drip tops all - and I will be doing Fashion Hunting, as always.  One small issue I have is the story is very rails - the Seikret and game pretends im in control as we go between points, but I am not at all. Would rather the game didnt lie to me rather than have me diagnostics check whether my controller is responding.  As always, dont appreciate the cost of changing character appearance and Palico, but Seikret seems to be free. Game is beautiful without any need for the HD Texture downloadable.  Can you believe it, dynamic weather?! Weather! In my Monster Hunter Game? Weather!!!"

190184163,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is an absolute blast. The environments are breathtaking, the monsters are incredible, and the combat feels buttery smooth. On top of that, the armor and weapons look amazing, making every new set feel exciting to craft and wear.  If I had to nitpick, I’d say the monsters could use a bit more health. Some fights feel like they end too quickly, and I’d love to have longer, more drawn-out battles to really enjoy the depth of the combat.  But honestly? That’s a small complaint in an otherwise fantastic game. Whether you're a longtime fan or brand new to the series, Wilds delivers an unforgettable hunting experience."
188970297,english,0,2246340,Built a new PC for this well above the recommended specs. Getting less than 30 frames in the plains. I know there's a magical game hiding under this wreckage. Capcom needs to dig it out.
188916638,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is the next major instalment in the Monster Hunter series. What Monster Hunter Worlds had, Wilds sadly, just falls short on what World's had. Not completely in a bad way but it is missing the ""good"" stuff about worlds - the end-game. After playing for 30 hours I can now tell you what I think about it!  EDIT: Review is up-to-date as of 18/03/25  Below I will state any issues, my pros and cons but first a quick disclaimer!  [b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b]   [h1][b] Pros[/b][/h1]  ⚫Monster Hunter Rise let you ride around on a palamute, in Monster Hunter Wilds you get to ride around on a Seikret that can GLIDE!?!?!?! I love it!!! ⚫So far, the improvements to weapons are amazing! Got my gunlance ready to be mastered again and now you can carry ANOTHER WEAPON!?!?!?! Now to swap between my bow and Gunlance whenever I want!!! ⚫Cooking has had an overhaul. Now, when you eat food buffs last a set time and they don't go away until the timer runs out, a bonus with this - the timer does not count down when you are in your camp... AMAZING!!! So much smoother now!! ⚫Each area is seamless so far. Full of life and stunning locales. Not only that, each area has weather that changes which adds to land itself. It really makes the land feel alive!! ⚫The monsters look stunning and all of their animations are just... spot on. I cannot tell you how much I love their animations and how amazing they look, especially with the HD texture pack. ⚫You can craft Artisan weapons which are insanely fun to use and to top it off these weapons deal devastating blows to monsters.  [h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1]  ⚫I have seen a lot of people say that the game is ""TO EASY"" - okay, it is much easier. MUCH easier, BUT it's only just out. Give it time. They can always add in Tempered or Arch tempered monsters or heck... a new difficulty bump setting at a later date.  ⚫Charging almost £10 for character edit vouchers is... not right. I am sorry but that's disgusting.  ⚫I have had a few ""performance"" issues here and there. A bit of lag, stutter and occasionally my textures turn to playdough. Another case of ""RELEASE NOW - PATCH LATER"". ⚫The end-game is a disappointment. You are forced to hunt the same 6 monsters over and over again - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna.... making the other 22 monsters completely useless. You will hunt the other 22 about... 1-3 times each and then never have to fight them again. Read about the end-game below!  [h1][b] How the End-Game works [/b][/h1]  So, don't hate me if I got this wrong - You open your map, look for 1 of the 6 TEMPERED monsters you are ONLY allowed to hunt - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna - if one is there, you save it as an investigation and you go do 1 field survey of it, then do the 3 investigations.   If none is there, you go back into your tent, rest (set weather and time to your liking) and then open your map and have a look again. If none is there, repeat. If one is there do the step above.  I am sorry... but this is the worst part of MH: Worlds.   [h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]  Coming from Monster Hunter Worlds and Monster Hunter Rise, Monster Hunter Wilds is definitely a step forward in some aspects but in others... 2 steps backwards, end-game and difficulty being the negatives.  If you are looking for a GOOD end-game, wilds sadly does not offer that, unless you don't mind brainlessly hunting the same 6 monsters for hundreds of hours for that one artisan weapon piece you need.  They have made Monster Hunter Wilds so much more approachable by making it easier for newer players. Do not judge it to harshly just now on that, its only just out, think towards the future for a DLC like Iceborne!!  [h1][b] 7.5/10! Many improvements but a lacklustre end-game makes for a dull experience sadly  [/b][/h1]"
190777174,english,0,2246340,"The game is fine but the challenge has been scraped away and the story is rather not desired. If you're thinking this is worlds 2 then you'll find it isn't.   It's a 70$ base game. It can handle a thumb down review especially since when it'll become ""good"" is when we all pay for a 30-50$ expansion."
188971275,english,0,2246340,Leaving this a Negative Review until they address the performance issues. Game constantly crashes and the frame rate is almost half of what I was able to get with the same settings running the benchmark prior to release.
188977489,english,0,2246340,"As others have started, optimization issues are the death of this game.  Honestly, I'm think the game ran better on the Steam Deck during the OBT than it did on release day.   I love this franchise, while I would love to give it a better score, I cannot experience the game.   A lack of modern hardware isn't an excuse for leaving a game unoptimized. There's no reason why my RTX3090 should be struggling, or for there not to be Steam Deck specific settings to let it run on there.  I will gladly change this review when the issues are resolved."
189974174,english,0,2246340,"Wait a year for the real version of the game to be released.   Also, Artian weapons are hideous."
189114692,english,0,2246340,"I've never returned a Monster Hunter game, but I'm really considering it for this one. Monster Hunter World is my most played game ever, followed by Monster Hunter Rise. I love these games. Even MHW had teething issues when it first released, and it was eventually improved and I was willing to upgrade my hardware to run it better. Wilds doesn't feel that way because:  1. It just doesn't look good. Textures are muddy and often incredibly pixelated. Hair, clothing, tents, wood structures, you name it, all look like a phoned-in effort at best. Once in a while you see a really nice texture, which only makes the rest look worse.  2. Despite the low quality textures and muddy sheen, performance is miserable. For reference, I'm on a 3080, and no matter what I set my options to, I can't break 60 fps. And once monsters come on screen, or any action happens, it's stutter city.  3. I know Capcom is capable of doing better. MHW and MHR both, IMHO, looked better and performed smoother than this one. It hurts to know they can do so much better, but didn't.  4. Co-op play is only ""sorta"" there. I buy these games to play with friends, and the way co-op works, you can't play through the story with them. You ""kinda"" can, but not really. It became frustrating enough that everyone basically said they'd just play through solo and consider multiplay when they all finish the campaign. Not the worse issue. Just an annoying one.  5. A loss of exploration. They touted that it was a big open world, however it's almost pointless to explore anywhere so far. When playing the story, if you wander too far from where they want you to be, they forcefully rotate your camera back around and tell you, ""no."" They don't tell you where to go, just where not to go. Frustrating.  6. Critics have seemingly ignored all of this. I don't why this bothers me so much. I myself am considering holding onto the game just because I love Monster Hunter so much. But the numerous glowing reviews seem very ""off"" to me for all of the aforementioned reasons.  Your mileage may vary. I wish you luck. If you have beefy hardware with all the framegen necessary to smooth out this mess, then all the power to you. I tried using the ""Lossless Scaling"" app to add framegen to my own setup, and it helped substantially. Though it still stuttered in battles, with the game looking worse than any previous Monster Hunter title I've played."
188953758,english,0,2246340,"I very rarely write reviews but i was looking forward to MH: Wilds as it looked closer to the only MH i enjoyed, MH World.  The fact is, the game is in a state that is not playable or acceptable for me at this current price.  3080 + Ryzen 5900x not being able to run the game at steady 60fps with Medium settings and DLSS on Performance is what it's actually WILD....  Will buy the game again when these glaring optimization issues are fixed.  In the current day and age where I can run just as incredible looking games, if not better, at Max Settings with 144fps, this is just simply unacceptable for me at the current state & price."
191947794,english,0,2246340,"[h1] Amazing Game-play, Horrible Performance [/h1]   I love how this game plays, but it doesn't love me back in terms of stuttering, frame drops, and the absurd lengths I have to go to get it to run even semi-smoothly. Despite all my efforts, setting everything to low or off in the settings, I can get maybe 60 FPS if I'm lucky, and the game looks like garbage to boot. The problem is it uses the CPU to render graphics instead of, y'know, the Graphics Processing Unit, so people like me who have a pretty good graphics card are punished for having a cheaper CPU to compensate. It seriously sucks that I can't enjoy a game I've been waiting years for just because I don't have the money for an expensive CPU for just this game. Save your money, wait until they finally do something about this, and if you already bought it, complain like me so we can force them to do something. This is ridiculous."

189602451,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter World's successor with incredible gameplay, possibly the best story a monster hunter ever provided (even if still just barely okay by normal standards), and hours upon hours upon hours of fun...  Anything wrong with the game is not gameplay but optimization. Performances are not great all around, and you will need need to run Reframework mod if you want not just better perfs but also perfect ultrawide support.  Outside of that I have a few caveats with the game: -Limited number of camps. Why? -Many bugs when it comes to skills. -Skills, as usual, don't tell you the value of what they give you most of the time, which is dumb.  Anyway, buy it, mod it, and enjoy the ride. It's a good game."
188988343,english,0,2246340,"Complain and let them hear you. This game rocks, but the performance feels sloppily done. This can be great, just need the devs to slot in peak performance for the optimization"
189253854,english,0,2246340,"+ loads of QoL changes added compared to world + Voice acting on player character - horrendous performance - lack of end game content - story is a walking simulator - no personal room - have less monster count vs world ( 29 vs 30 ), and there is reuse from world - alpha & beta set is just a color change, not a design variation - blowgun bind recoil to ammo type, and can no longer reduce it through customization  In conclusion this is a half finished product, somehow Capcom have a worse launch than MHRise, In its current state I don't recommend this game"
189012561,english,0,2246340,"Thanks Capcom and Denuvo, I love buying a 70 dollar game and being slapped by Denuvo saying they can't validate it. I don't give a damn I paid for this game and it's already been a nightmare to get this unoptomized mess running!"

189075115,english,0,2246340,"So two things, this game in terms of game-play is impeccable, easily one of the best monster hunters they have ever made if we are talking strictly in terms of how the game plays. However this game runs really, really bad unless you have a supercomputer, horrible FPS and poorly optimized, this game needs a few patches for sure and hopefully Capcom will do them unlike Dragons Dogma 2. Great game on the merit of the game itself, but runs absolutely awful, I think we can say by now the RE engine was not made with games like this in mind."

189110461,english,0,2246340,"Love this game, for me its easily a 9/10 maybe even a 10/10 I have beaten LR and rolled credits and I'm currently making my way through HR. But I cannot, under any circumstances recommend this game to anyone in its current state due to performance and I'm primarily writing this review to add to the discourse in a way that Capcom can respond to and hopefully address.   I am running a 3070ti and Im managing anywhere from 70 - 110 fps on high preset setting with some tweaks, how you might ask? By leaning on AMD's FSR with framegen enabled and dropping my resolution down to 1080p. This works to create a somewhat smooth experience, especially on controller where I feel input lag less, but what it does not create is a beautiful experience. The game is stunning and I say that as someone that thought the game was a washed out mess at first. When they allow it to during different in game 'seasons' colours begin to pop and areas really come to life. Unfortunately due to my settings FSR tends to make textures blurry and muddy, especially at a distance, so until they can fix the absolutely terrible optimisation my game will continue to look like this.  I will update my review if and when fixes come through, the more I look at it, the more I am certain this game was rushed out the door before it was ready. Do not buy this game if you aren't a fan of the series already, wait for the updates and by then there might even be a discount."
189002811,english,1,2246340,"Yes. The game is poorly optimized, who knows why Capcom went with the RE engine making a giant open world game, but it is seriously not that bad if you play on Medium settings. I was trying to play on high and it was terrible after playing for roughly 3 hours before I changed it to Medium. Once I did change it, it worked perfectly fine with no hiccups. Capcom do better, but absolutely stellar game nonetheless.  32GB Ram AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600 NVIDIA 4060ti"
188997656,english,0,2246340,"I'm enjoying it, but the presence of Denuvo means that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the game on anything less than very recent technology (RTX 40 series, Intel 13th gen, etc.)  To be honest, the game is just poorly optimized. I am able to achieve higher than 60 FPS on my own setup without frame generation, but I can still tell something is just not quite right. It runs worse than the betas did, but there's one word that easily explains this.  Denuvo. Denuvo is that word. Why is anyone still using this garbage?  If something changes on this front (I don't expect it will, Capcom is notoriously stubborn on this point) then I may consider changing this review.  Again, I am enjoying the game. But for the purposes of recommending this game to the wider public, I feel the need to leave this red so that people REALLY consider whether this is a worthwhile purchase for them."
188983287,english,0,2246340,optimization is so bad benchtest score was above 20k but crashes whenever the game enters a cut scene when actually playing. i can start the game but cant play past slaying the first monster. new update of review 3.14.2025 game still crashes alot have checked all drives and reinstalled the game. will update review after game has been updated again.

189333958,english,1,2246340,"I have played every monster hunter game since Tri at least twice, and I usually play to complete the HR100 or equivalent boss on every save. I also played the older live service games, Monster hunter frontier and Monster hunter online. Here are my thoughts on wilds (HR70/50 hours in game at time of writing):   Positives-  POOGIE IS BACK  Monster hunter wilds is really fun, and anyone familiar with the series will like it a lot. The gameplay loop hasn't changed, and capcom has implemented a ton of quality of life changes that make it more accessible to people who want to hunt more and grind materials less.  The new monsters are all really cool, along with their weapon and armor designs. Capcom does not miss when it comes to aesthetics in these games.  As a veteran hunter, I was worried the combat in this game would not be as enjoyable as previous titles, and while hunts are the easiest they have ever been, the attacks and animations in this game FEEL SO GOOD you basically don't notice. I have not used seikret or mantels during combat to make it more challenging, and used un-upgraded starting armor through LR6, but throughout the whole story (both low and high rank) I only carted [died] about 3 times, and did not fail a single quest. I was planning on avoiding using focus mode and exploiting wounds as well, but honestly they are so fun and satisfying to use I would sacrifice the difficulty for the satisfaction. Despite the lack of difficulty, the gameplay loop and game feel is worth 70$ to me personally.  The story in this game is... an improvement from previous entries. The characters, cutscenes, and storyline are more involved and compelling than previous installments, but to be honest, I don't think many people are playing monster hunter for a compelling story. unga bunga hammer go bonk, and all that  Overall, the game feel is impeccable, and I will probably end up putting at least a couple hundred hours into it before its G/Master rank expansion releases in a couple years. Capcom has already promised half a dozen or more free title updates over the next year that will include new monsters and loads of event quests and other things to do in the game. For me at least, the $70 is worth it to satiate my addiction to this series.   Negatives-  Performance is really bad. I have a Ryzen 9 5950x and a 3090 and I am playing this game at 4k high, raytracing off and getting 45FPS. This is playable for me because I spent a decade playing on a 3ds outdoors at 20 fps, but understandably many people are not willing to play a 70$ game below 60fps or able to afford a PC capable of more than 30fps.  On top of the low framerates, graphical bugs are not uncommon either. I personally have experienced the ""black triangle"" 3 or 4 times in my 45 hours of gameplay, which causes a flashing black triangle to fill about a quarter of your screen for 20 seconds or so for no apparent reason, which makes the game almost unplayable while its happening. I have also seen the ""PS2 graphics"" bug, where some models appear to have about 100 polygons like OG Final Fantasy 7. For me this happened once after fast travelling and it resolved itself after about 3 seconds. I personally have not experienced any game crashes (I'm on the latest version of Windows 11 with the latest graphics drivers).  In classic capcom fashion, the menus in this game are heinous.  in particular, setting up multiplayer is particularly problematic until you figure out the system, so I will explain what you need to do to get it working the way you expect it too:  Basically, you want to have your friends in a lobby AND a link party at the same time. The lobby is basically how you can see your friends in the overworld, while a link party allows you to go on quests together as a group. you can go on quests together using either one, but for the best experience, you want both. To set it up: 1. you want one person to create a private lobby after selecting their save data on the home screen. 2. after loading in to the game, that player should get the lobby ID by going to the member list screen (start -> tab 4, labelled ""communication"" -> member list). The lobby ID will be displayed on the right. This player should send that lobby ID to everyone they want to play with. 3. The other players should select ""lobby search"" and then ""find a lobby based on ID"". (finding from in game or steam friends lists seems to have a 30% or less success rate, lobby ID works every time in my experience). 4. After loading in to the lobby, one player should go back to the member list mentioned before, and go to the ""lobby"" tab, then select and invite the other players to a link party. 5. The other players then need to accept the link party invite, either by holding the plus button on their controller after they receive the notification, or by going to start -> communication -> invites -> received invites.  From here, players will be able to see eachother in the overworld (because they are in the same lobby) and will automatically be able to join quests the other players post (because of the link party). Keep in mind a private lobby can have 16 players but a link party is only 4, so your lobby can have 4 groups of 4. You can also join quests from outside a link party by talking to Alma, so you can do quests with anyone else in the lobby, its just less convenient. You can have a link party between players in different lobbies and a lobby with no link parties, but you probably want both.  lastly, I personally found the music to be a little underwhelming compared to previous entries.  None of the negatives are severe enough to be a deal breaker to me, especially since most of them will (hopefully) be patched out.  EDIT:  After thinking about it a while last night, I realized that what really sets the old world games (everything before Monster hunter world) apart from the more recent ones is the feeling that you are really in an intense fight with a monster. I cant really put my finger on what makes that difference, but it has something to do with the players ability to move more freely in current games.  Old world games required a lot more intentionality and commitment to attacks because a poorly timed or spaced attack could cost a cart. I feel like I can get through basically any hunt in Wilds by mashing buttons on my controller while wielding a sword and shield, but I do look WAY cooler doing it in wilds than in any other game.  Part of what I enjoy about monster hunter is the community aspect. Joining a random quest to get materials you need and finding people spamming stickers and gestures and having fun in post game is as relevant as the combat itself to me. Those kinds of interactions aren't as accessible in old world games as they used to be (albiet not impossible to find).  I'm playing with 2 different groups of friends so I am having fun helping them progress through the game while using my own time to do fashion hunting and grind materials for melding armor spheres and artian upgrades. Capcom added event quests and more weekly challenges today. Even if I don't enjoy this game the same way I did old world games, I am still having a lot of fun playing it and it still feels like there is enough for me to do (although I wish there was more).  While it doesn't impact my review of this game at all, I would encourage anyone that enjoys wilds as their first monster hunter to play an old world game like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.   Update as of HR100/~60 hours in game: I was at steam review character limit so I put it on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7acuo/"
190034181,english,1,2246340,"After 60 hours, hunting every monster, and hitting HR 75, I think I can say this is a good entry into the Monster Hunter franchise.   The elephant in the room is of course being the performance and technical state of the game. Quite frankly, this launch is unacceptable. There's no reason for my new rig with a 4070ti and a Ryzen 5 7600x should be struggling to hit 60fps at 1080p. It seems like they really want you to use frame generation on your first bootup as a magic bandaid, but that's not how this works. Bad performance is bad performance. This alone would normally get me to give it a negative review.  But dammit, this game is so fun. It's all I've been thinking about lately. In terms of the core gameplay, this is the best monster hunter has ever been. Everything feels good to use, every weapon is fun, every fight is cinematic, and every monster is diverse, and in my opinion, more interesting than the monsters in base world.  That being said, it's not all fantastic. The other elephant in the room is the difficulty of the game, which has been a hot topic, and has been since World even. This was my experience: I played most of the game solo or with a buddy, and I honestly didn't see much issue with the difficulty. I'm not a Monster Hunter expert, but I'm not a beginner either, so I expected low rank to be a pushover and it was, no problem with that. High rank saw a boost in difficulty, primarily with the Apex Predators, that I was happy with. Not too hard (which will come in master rank I'm sure) but not brain dead. I rarely carted throughout the game, but I also played previous Monster Hunters and still had to actually fight. From my memory this is about the experience I had in World as well.   But then I decided to play some 4-player SOS missions, and the dynamic changed entirely. Most monsters rarely attacked since they were constantly getting hammered, wounded, and stunned, including late monsters. World wasn't entirely difficult either, but this slaughter wasn't as common place even with 4 other players. It feels like the game was balanced for solo and duo play and not much else, the monster health is super low and the wound status rate is too high, which just creates scenarios where 4 players wail on the monster creating perpetual wounds. A big appeal of Monster Hunter is the multiplayer, which makes this a bit of a disappointment. Teaming up in Monster Hunter usually always makes it easier, but it really shouldn't be this much of a leap to where hunts end almost as soon as you reach the monster. This WASN'T the case in World, I still felt like 4-player hunts were fun in that game even if it was a tad easier.   In general, multiplayer is the weak point of this. Needlessly complicated to even get into a game, in some cases even a downgrade from prior games in terms of accessibility. I don't see the reason for the distinction between Lobbies, Link Groups, and Environment Links. It just seems overly complicated and poorly explained. And of course, the famous communication error makes a grand return.  Arena missions are missing as well, which is unfortunate. Some of my favorite memories of previous Monster Hunter games were teaming with a friend to get the best time with the pre-selected gear setups, but that aspect of the game is gone. Hopefully it makes a return in a future title update or in the Master Rank expansion. (EDIT: Confirmed for title update 1!!)  And then there's some general gameplay changes, i.e. the Seikret mount, no monster tracking, easy escapes and heals. To be fair, most of these were introduced in Rise and were just brought back to this, but generally I don't think they were needed and likelycontribute to the lack of challenge veterans are experiencing. Hunters and Palicoes have more tools now than ever before, but the monsters haven't been buffed to match (yet) and it's starting to show the divide. Again, low and high rank are all that's available, so I can't say whether this is necessarily good or bad yet, but I can't deny some of the Monster Hunter identity seems to be lost. Tracking and searching may have been shallow, boring, and frustrating in the other entries, but it was a part of the charm of actually hunting the monster. You could argue with that gone you can get right to the good bit, which is the fights, but then it just ends up feeling like a boss rush game and less like a hunt, especially when ""prep-time"" feels like more of an afterthought now more than ever.   That being said, I have still thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game (and not done yet!) and think it's still some of the best gameplay the series has to offer, which at the end of the day is what draws me in. This is the perfect starting point for a new hunter and has a lot to offer. Just keep in mind Monster Hunter is famous for confusing progression and menus, and just have fun with it without getting bogged down too much. Looking forward to crown hunting (yes I'm crazy), updates, and Master Rank!"
189066635,english,1,2246340,"Guys, I like the gameplay and all, but could you add more menus to the game? I feel like there are not enough menus in the game. I would like at least 2x more menus for each interaction. Also, I think 2-3 types of party aren't enough to play with a friend. We need at least 5-6 types. Maybe with 2-3 menus each. Also, could you add 2-3 submenus in the main-menu?"
190904134,english,1,2246340,"To say I've put in quite a few hours over the past few weeks would be an understatement, so obviously I had a good time. If I take away some of my bias, it barely passes the recommended line though, and definitely with some caveats.  [h3]Caveat 1: Optimization[/h3] Let's start with the elephant in the room. The game runs worse than QWOP. You need a top of the line rig and preferably 2 to 3 mods in order to ensure it runs smooth enough on higher graphic settings. If you own a more affordable PC, there are about 10 different optimization guides and a reddit megathreat to help you out with making the game playable.  If that's not your cup of tea, don't buy the game until they fix this premium priced mess.  [h3]Caveat 2: Difficulty[/h3] I started with Monster Hunter Rise, and it was the same story back then. The new mechanic made the game too easy. Now I hear similar arguments about Seikrets making the game too easy.  I think a lot of people understate the fact that escape mechanics are relatively trivial in the long run. When I started in Rise, I needed that escape to succeed quests. As I got more experienced at hunting monsters, it started to feel like an easy escape button. After hundreds of hours the ability became trivial since I had mastered my dodges and evades.  When I started in Wilds, I very rarely used my Seikret escape button. It's because I came in with thousands of hours of experience. Experience that translates to this game, because at its core it's still a Monster Hunter game. As the title updates and eventually master rank will arrive, we will see a bump in difficulty, until we min-maxed those end game builds. Then everyone will be complaining again that it's too easy.  I don't think the same applies to new players though, or the ones that play every now and then. Monster Hunter in general is very overwhelming if it's your first entry into the series, and I believe Wilds strikes a good balance between difficulty, survivability and most importantly...fun. There is very little that stops you from playing the game. There is almost always something you can do through skills, items or abilities.  In other words, if you are a veteran looking for a difficult Monster Hunter game, I can't recommend this one. If you are new to series, and have a NASA PC at home, and are willing to install mods, I can recommend this game.  [h3]Caveat 3: Purpose of Monster Hunter[/h3] I hear a lot of complaints about how the series is turning away from its original purpose. I can't account for that myself because this is my second Monster Hunter game. What I can account for is my own reason for why I boot up the game. It's to hunt monsters. And in my opinion, that's the most important part of a Monster Hunter game.  Hunts may or may not last shorter. Tools may or may not be unlocked quicker. I don't know. What I do know, is that the fights are amazing. In between the 10 million stutters, frame freezes and disconnects of course. Whether that's 4 veterans absolutely destroying a monster, or just you, your weapon and your skills. There is also a good variety of monsters, given that this is only the starting roster.  In order to get to the fun part you do need to put in some hours though. Monster Hunter is notorious for feeling clunky at first. There is a flow which most people only start to appreciate after they have spend a substantial amount of time with the combat mechanics. Once you have found the weapon that fits with your flow, hunts starts to feel like dances with the monsters, and it feels great. That's why I keep playing.  If you're down for that, then I can recommend this game. Again, provided you have a NASA PC at home and a Nexus account for some optimization mods. If you are looking for elaborate preparation rituals and a deep understanding of the game in order to beat monsters, then this is not the game for you.  [h3]Caveat 4: Multiplayer[/h3] If you want to play with friends, there are lobbies, squads, link parties, hunter friends and two different voice chat channels. It's a confusing mess. Once you know where to look it's quite simple of course, but you need a 5 step guide to help you do this for the first time.  If you are more of a solo player, you can't cue up for SOS quests. Instead the game shows you a list of all the SOS quests that are ''available.'' You have to manually click on one, request to join, wait, click away a message that says you can't join the session, click away another message that says you can't join the quest, back out of the quest menu, select another quest from the list, and repeat the process. Just host your own quests, it's much better for your mental health.  [h3]Story and Music[/h3] Lastly I want to touch on 2 more points. The story is alright. It actually ties into the locales you visit and the monsters you hunt. It also has some cool lore bits if you are into that. But it's nothing to write home about. The monster themes on the other hand are absolute bangers.  [h3]In Conclusion[/h3] If you want to have some fun hunting monsters with or without others, then I can recommend this game. It has a good starting roster of monsters and there is more to come. The combat will take some time to get used to, but after that there is a lot of fun to be had if you ask me. Even when you got fights down to a science. Aside from the actual fights, it has little else going for it. Hopefully, for now.  However, the game is optimized so badly that I can only recommend it in good faith if you have a very solid PC. If that's not the case, I would wait until they have rolled out enough patches to at least make the optimization mods obsolete.  [i]Edits: spotted some grammar mistakes.[/i]"
189304061,english,1,2246340,"Incredible Game. After 60 and just hitting HR 100 I can say that - while I think the basegame DOES lack a bit of content compared to the release of the other Titles I played:  - Investigations are insanely fun - Farming for Items be it Armor or Decos is incredibly fun and feels like a rewarding loop that didnt get stale for me so far - Outside of 2 Figths every Monster in this Game on release for me is a good and fun one.   THE PC PORT HOWEVER LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED. Lots of graphical issues and the game crashes for me at least like once a day. To however complains about the difficulty: Yes the Game isnt that hard, but its fights are fun and imo thats what matters way more"

188928780,english,0,2246340,"Ok, I'll say this Capcom. I love your games, I even loved this game so far, it has a lot of incredible stuff in it. I can see why people are giving it 8/10, 9/10, even 10/10. I'm even able to play it at a comfortable stable framerate with good visuals, because thankfully I'm blessed with quite a decent setup. But WHAT THE HELL is this lack of optimization and you trying to force Framegen on us? Not everyone is even able to use this tech. I saw how the game runs and looks on consoles, also not the best situation there.   You'd think that the whole situation with Dragon's Dogma 2 would change smth for the better, and instead we have this.   As of now, unless you have a beefy PC or an absolute MH fan, who'd play this game at a low locked framerate with possible sacrifices in terms of visuals, do NOT buy this game. Wait for a sale, better optimization, or whenever you have an amazing rig. This is the worst AAA product in terms of it's technical state that I've seen in a LONG time man."

I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point.  I am by no means saying the game is bad, but in its current state, you should probably consider waiting for a more stable release."
190708376,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter has been my favorite franchise for a long time, and I am very excited for the new generation of Monster Hunter.   My first impression after 20 hours of game time, I feel like there are a lot of aspects that have been simplified.   There are no more hunting monster tracks. You just get on your mount, and it will carry you to your target automatically.  Another aspects I like in Monster Hunter is how important preparation is, but in Wild, that doesn't realy matter. You forgot to bring a warming potion, oh don't worry, the game has you covered.   I could write a lot of paragraphs complaining about how much easier this game is compared to its predecessor, but maybe people are tired of it.    However after 80 hours. I finally realized that Wild is a better game for me, at least now, since I don't have much time to play games anymore, let alone having to hunt one monster for up to 60 minutes.  I hope that with so many QOL's that make hunting easier, Capcom can balance it by providing new, more challenging monsters."
190363900,english,0,2246340,"This is being written before any of the game's major updates, about three weeks after launch. And it's being written by an insane old lady who started playing this franchise on her Playstation 2 in 2005, who cares about it more than she ought to. I also had a lot of fun in my 50 hours so far. Hitting 'no' on whether I recommend it isn't really a literal 'I do not recommend the game'. It also has nothing to do with the extremely valid criticisms of the game's extremely dogwater performance. Keep all that in mind.  I don't think my take on Wilds is going to be a popular one, even with as many critics as it's building up. Which is fine, I'm used to that, World is the first time I've actually agreed with majority consensus on this franchise, while before that I would have still insisted Unite was the best in the series. That isn't a popular take. But I really can't help but feel like Wilds has gone in a bad direction for the long-term health of the series. Not because of the shorter hunts or the 'lack of content' that you may have already heard complaints about, especially that latter one. I DO think there's some truth to it, I think even at launch World had a lot more to do, but zero question that perception is mostly from people remembering World in its final state.  My issue is that this game feels completely frictionless. The game doesn't feel like it ever stops me, it doesn't feel like it ever trips me up. Everything is so easy to do, not just the fights but supplies and food and inventories and unlocks and layered gear and, just everything. Your mount automatically sends you to where you need to go and everything you'd ever need is put in your pocket then the big monster dies after tapping you on the wrist a couple times and that's that. Even that example I gave before, there's just as many palico gadgets and we obviously still have a mount, but you just kinda. Get them. I didn't have to explore some weirdo unmarked nook of the map to do a weirdo unmarked quest for some random unmarked cats, I just kinda got it. Everything is laid out for you, handed to you.  There's good and bad to the friction being gone. I love that sharpening is actually possible to do mid-fight solo now, but I feel like it's too generous that my seikret can just pick me up to bail me out of anything at all ever. I'm not going to miss Nergigante's 'roar which stuns you for long enough that you don't have time to sheathe your weapon to superman dive away from his now undodgeable attack' garbage, but I'm not sure I like that trade if it means NOTHING feels threatening. Nobody liked the old deco drop rates but... I dunno, it feels a little hollow finishing my build 50 hours into the game. Half of this stuff wouldn't be bad on its own, and half of it is actively good, but all at once? Remove ALL the friction, good and bad, at once? It makes it feel aimless, insubstantial, braindead. The game is so devoid of ANY sort of friction that I'm sitting over here feeling nostalgic about paintballs and mid-fight combining, for gods sake. Those were NOT good mechanics, but in a room full of padded walls I'm craving something concrete, something with some weight to it.  I think my biggest gripe - and I KNOW this take is going to be super unpopular - is focus mode. I just don't think I should be able to throw out attacks nonstop without thinking about them and relying on focus mode's 180s to trivialize positioning. To me, the essence of monhun is the need for commitment, for planning, the fact that having to consider so many things regarding monsters and your own movement and positioning in advance not only necessitated deeply learning monsters' behaviours, but rewarded you massively for it. Landing a TCS on a mobile monster used to be a thing of mastery and beauty and now it's just... Nothing.  The game honestly kinda feels more adjacent to Helldivers than World. A party game that exists purely for small groups of friends to roll loot slot machines in. And don't get me wrong, I like those kind of games, but that's not what monhun was to me.  Regardless of whether future monsters do more damage and take longer to kill, that won't change the fact that focus mode makes positioning nearly redundant, that every single weapon has get-out-of-jail-free moves, that the big moves just aren't hard to pull off anymore given they're either twice as fast or have super armour or both and even if you do screw it up completely you can roll out of it before it's even gone off, that your seikret ensures it's nearly impossible to get combo'd out, that the absolute worst the game can do is put up a Quest Failed screen and take away the 5 mega potions you used on the fight from your stash of 800.  I said at the start of this that I don't necessarily not recommend the game. But, at present, I would definitely recommend you to play World first. Too many edges got sanded down, I think. It's lacking the franchise's usual weirdness, and its abrasiveness. You can give the upcoming update monsters 10 times more HP, but it won't bring back the feeling of satisfaction that overcoming those rough edges brought.  In retrospect Monster Hunter Wilds is a very ironic name for something that feels so completely toothless.  EDIT: I did not expect so much attention on this, let alone for it to all be positive. Thanks for that! Especially the people sharing their old hunting stories, so, lemme share one of my own nostalgic hunting stories as thanks.  I still hadn't 'got' monhun when Unite came out, despite playing 1, 2 and F2. Nargacuga was the flagship monster for that game and I really liked (and still like) its design. I got the quest to hunt it, suited up with my trusty old Akantor armour, and decided on dual blades for it. One of my weaker weapons but it felt appropriate. And, like, what's the worst that could happen? I wasn't even in G Rank yet.  I drastically underestimated how tough a fight it would be, and wasn't nearly good enough with DB for it. I carted twice quickly just from being blindsided. I played safer from then but was still getting knocked around.  I went through my entire potion supply. I kept fighting but got low on HP and ran off to actually use the tent to heal (a lot of people didn't even know you could do that in the older games lmao), and do some old fashioned on-field procurement of potion materials, despite being unfamiliar with the new map. I hadn't had to do that since monhun 1. I thought about going home for the hammer but despite the struggle I was just... having fun. It really did feel like I'd just met something that was my match and I had to knuckle down and learn it.  I somehow managed to keep surviving, but the timer was becoming an issue. I'd barely even remembered quests had a time limit. I basically had no hopes for finishing it off, I was just keeping up the fight as practice. But I kept swinging when I could. Past 45 minutes I stopped going off to gather even when I fell into fatal range. And with literally less than a minute on the clock, it died. Out of almost all my supplies, battered and broken, hanging onto my last life by a thread, but I managed it.  It's still my favourite monster hunter memory. As Wilds is, it's really hard to imagine it making a story, and a feeling, like this. World gave me some similar ones with some of the nastier monsters. Most of those memories were from Iceborne, though, so I do still think there's hope for Wilds to turn out some great moments with AT patches or the inevitable expansion, but like I say in the review, patches can up the numbers but they can't make Helmsplitter satisfying again.  But also like I said in the review, I didn't really like the games between Unite and World much. It's not the end of the world if Wilds still winds up mid after everything. I waited 9 years between monhuns I actually liked before and I can do it again.  Happy hunting, y'all."
191600679,english,0,2246340,"Optimized mess. Modern games need to stop using new PC parts as an excuse, there are games that look 5x as better as this that released years ago and run on older computers completely fine."
191935978,english,0,2246340,"Too hard. Too many Apex monsters use a new attack called ""GENERATE CRASH REPORT"" that can't be dodged and can't be blocked. And ends hunt, bypassing all carts.  Would be a great game once this attack is nerfed."
189006148,english,0,2246340,"Ignoring the glaring performance and networking issues, I don't understand how you managed to make the multiplayer so bad after publishing Rise.   When the multiplayer works, it has the same problems as World, like needing to start quests solo, find the objective, watch a cutscene, exit the quest, and join a friend to actually play the game together.  Why? You already had a good system in Rise. If you're going to do sequences and cutscenes, let me at least bring a friend along.  Also, link groups are a stupid mechanic. Why is progression not tied to the lobby?   For the brief minutes where I do manage to fight the monster with friends, it's a really fun experience. This game may very well have the best combat in the series. I genuinely don't know why you designed the multiplayer this way.  Edit: A lot of you mentioned playing from a squad lobby, and it did make joining after the cutscene much more bearable, but I still don't like the game's singleplayer oriented design for the story quests, especially when Rise and GU story quests both work flawlessly with multiplayer. (Haven't played the older games yet)  Happy to report that non-story missions work with multiplayer almost flawlessly in Wilds. I'm hoping once my group reaches high-rank things will open up a bit more."
192286286,english,1,2246340,"Disclaimer: I played a ton of Monster Hunter so my thoughts come from that position. I'm not a 'purist' who outright dismisses modern MonHun, there's design decisions I have problems with but my focus is mostly on the product. I'm mostly comparing Wilds to World considering these are ""A team"" games (stuff like rise/sunbreak is the B team).  4 key points: Content, Performance, Story, Gameplay.  Content Is always iffy on new Monster Hunter releases. The games are being treated like Pokemon, with an eventual big update dlc/expansion basically making the game feel complete. This is one of the more unfinished feeling experiences I've had with Monster Hunter. I don't say this just from the wealth of Monsters to fight, Tri probably had less, but there's a lot of gaps particularily in the endgame. The fact that the open beta had you fight the de-facto final boss of the game is mad to me. I genuinely had my final boss fight before the game released, it was way harder too which was super satisfying once I beat it. The game is also pushing stuff that feels like it should be basegame into content updates. The first big content update is huge but it also definitely should have been there in the first place.   Performance sucks. The game took 0 lessons from World (And the A team worked on this prior). There's just no two ways about it. You can watch someones youtube footage on a 5090 and they still get texture pop-in. World had massive performance issues at launch and the ones here feel especially eggregious considering World probably is a better looking game too. Try the benchmark.  Story I'm only mentioning because of how forced it is. They definitely wanted to focus on it more this time around but the problem is that it's just not good. It's painfully formulaic and the twist in the middle actually made me laugh out loud with how silly it is. My multiplayer experience with friends was hampered multiple times by one of us having to go through a forced walk-and-talk that you cannot skip. I don't think a strong story would not work in a monster hunter, quite the opposite, but it's definitely not exploring anything interesting with the setting.  Your character this time is fully voiced and also a total badass during cutscenes right from the get-go. Very hard to immerse yourself that way. I cannot understate how egregious it is that your character is being treated like a newgame+++ gigachad from minute 1. Usually monster hunter treats your guy fresh meat straight outta the academy, and you earn your badass status by working your way through challenges. Nata (the kid) gets introduced as the surrogate protagonist because you need a character who is even remotely vulnerable to have some stakes. The confrontation with the final boss may as well have had linkin park playing with how badass/edgy the setup was.  Gameplay. Lotta things I could talk about here. There's plenty of smaller nitpicks between a really awkward multiplayer lobby system and questionable weapon balance, but if I had to summarize the biggest issue with Wilds it would be something like this: This is the Monster Hunter game where they want you to feel like a badass. Hunter movesets are far too powerful, Monsters did not compensate enough for this. You are consistently overpowering monsters at every stage of the game. As others have pointed out before, the game feels like you are beating low-rank monsters with high-rank gear. Hunter movesets were made to be a lot more mobile which is definitely fun, but it also means that positioning matters less. Why reposition for a big attack when you can just press the parry/counter that is completely reaction based, on a very very easy reaction no less. Parries definitely do not come at a premium in this one. A lot of talk was made about how the Seikret was an improvement over the wirebug from rise, but I think people underestimate how powerful the Seikret is. The game doesn't outright say this but you can get knocked down and still call your bird, completely saving you with plenty of invulnerability, making it functionally impossible to die given how calling it is free. This is by far the easiest monster hunter.  My guess is this is also why the Story treats you like a badass from the get-go. I think this is a deliberate decision by the devs. This is the game about the power fantasy of being a monster hunter, but it feels unearned if the challenges aren't really there (or your character does something badass in a cutscene).  The content and difficulty in this game are intertwined. The grind in Monster Hunter primarily functions as the endgame and replayability, giving you goals to do micro-optimizations to your gear, try different weapon loadouts, etc. Problem is they hand you everything way too quickly. An armorset can be completed in 2 hunts. Jewels you basically get shoved down your throat (and I didn't even do the farming exploit that was meta for a while). And why grind anyway if I'm already demolishing monsters. I don't really feel the improvements to my gear when fights are easy and they are still easy with better gear. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of the series, I'm not expecting to get challenged the same way here as I am with late-stage content of older games. But this is the only monster hunter where I just feel ""done"" with the game. I've seen it all.  The future for this game is a little iffy. They clearly shipped the game too early and are introducing more stuff with their scheduled content updates. I'm not certain they will fix core issues with the game however. They talk about looking into balancing and I certainly hope their 'careful language' there will bring the overall powerlevel of hunters down, but I doubt it.  I'm probably coming back to it once the big ""rise2"" expansion releases, but until then, as I said, I've seen it all. I would still recommend this game as an entrypoint for newcomers if you have the PC hardware to properly run it. It's still monster hunter. It's still fun with friends and all. But after finishing wilds we went back to revisit sunbreak and had a much better time overall."

189044441,english,0,2246340,"[h1][b]Here's the most relevant reasons the game feels so bad until high-rank:[/b][/h1]  [b]1. Performance, and fidelity.[/b] Reasonable framerates on everything but the latest GPUs come at the cost of textures that look straight out of a ps2 game half the time. Why do my scoutflies look like minecraft particle effects when I'm not 2 inches from them? Why does having more than 2 entities on screen, or rotating my camera at all, cause stuttering? The difference in quality between this and other recent AAA titles is staggering. Wilds has such good designs and animations, which get severely neutered by the absolutely broken performance.  [b]2. Multiplayer cohesion.[/b] It is miserable to have to re-join a quest, only after someone has actively started the hunting portion of the quest, when you have played along the exact same questline. Not only that, even if you're playing in tandem, you have to ACTIVELY run away from the hunt you're trying to complete together in order to even re-join your friends, since the game gives you a connection error if you get hit by the monster you were immediately forced to fight. It's crazy that they managed to un-fix a problem I thought they'd resolved in other titles.  [b]3. Pacing.[/b] Good lord, it's miserable. Are you going to get a cutscene that forces you to leave the area immediately after a quest? Or maybe a dialogue sequence you have to skip through one message at a time? Or an unskippable auto-walk at the slowest possible movement rate on your seikret? After 2-4 of these, randomly chosen, you will be immediately thrust into a hunt that lasts all of 5 minutes. Repeat until the credits roll.  [b]4.  Difficulty.[/b] Worlds and Rise both had significantly harder monsters than anything in Wilds. They have tiny health pools that make it so you barely engage a monster before it's dead. Their attacks do negligable damage that is healed with 1 potion (or better yet by your palico which you no longer have any choices to make regarding their tools), and there's no threatening follow-ups to the monster attacks on the off-chance they even get you low enough to care. Wounds spawn constantly, and borderline stunlock monsters when you proc them. I never, ever felt anything that could qualify as a challenge, not even on the final boss, and so I felt like I had to rush the game to even have a chance at enjoying any gameplay, because HOPEFULLY high-rank is a little less trivial.  [b]5. Exploration.[/b] There is literally no reason to do any exploring, at all, ever. The closest you could get to an incentive would be for pop-up camp locations. Your seikret transports you to all but two destinations automatically, and the entire map and all of it's resources are revealed. There's no gameplay-driven reason to hunt for anything, and it is so sad because the artists put tremendous work into the scope and detail of the world, and the monsters, and the environments, and it all gets wasted because you're never made to gather monster tracks, or do an expedition, or hunt for gathering spots.  When you combine all of these factors, you get a game that feels like it's trying to say [b]""Hey, actually, please don't engage with me until the postgame, because every single system I'm built on is working together to make the process of getting there nothing but a chore.""[/b] It's insane how many systems they discarded that validated the entire experience of Monster Hunter. God, I hope high-rank has some challenge to it at least. It's unforgiveable how badly they designed this game in totality. Bless the artists, and the combat designers, but every director in charge of the rest of the game should be ashamed of the experience they've provided us."

It was fine in the 1st beta, but since the 2nd beta it has been causing crashes, freezes and insane FPS drops for me. - Without the frame generation, the game runs quite poorly on RTX 4070Ti. The optimization is absolutely horrible. - Enabling highest resolution textures causes constant pop-in, despite GPU having more than enough memory to store textures.

189462918,english,1,2246340,"[h1]Preface[/h1] Ever since our beloved series reached the eyes and ears of rest of the world, Capcom has made a valiant effort to keep Monster Hunter titles in check with various innovations to keep the series fresh and appealing to a wider audience. Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.  In this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I'm not even looking at you this time, Rise. You're third place no matter what.  [h1]Positives[/h1] [b]Core Gameplay[/b] The core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I've been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it's all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we're all here for it.  [b]Multiplayer & Questing[/b] The lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn't hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I've seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don't see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to ""load in"" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of ""not taking us out of the immersion.""  [b]The Monsters[/b] The bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren't as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don't seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an ""identity"" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.  [h1]Negatives[/h1] [b]Repetitive Flow - For the first time ever[/b] Although the weapons feature numerous ""gimmicks"" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don't get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what's with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...  [b]Items and Builds - Unnecessary?[/b] I have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I'm almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don't really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.  [b]Lack of Central Hub[/b] The number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!  [b]Bland Story[/b] If I don't mention this category, I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with ""Acknowledged"" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] [b]Final Verdict: 8/10 B[/b] Although the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn't a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state. As I mentioned in the preface, Wilds is more of the same in this humble veteran's eyes, and you can sit comfortably in front of your screen and take heart in knowing that even if you don't buy it now, the game isn't going anywhere. The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the ""gotta play the new game"" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven't tried it yet.  Better yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal. One final note in that regard: aside from the achievement that requires online hunting, I still prefer to solo everything without any issue just because I want get those focus attacks in without interruption. Who knows? You might feel the same way, fellow hunter."
189435988,english,0,2246340,"Extremely fun gameplay but cant recommend in its current state.  Exploding polygons/vertices, horrible texture pop-ins, network errors galore. Generally horrid optimization.  There are also some bugged skills that currently do not work with Heavy and Light Bowguns  Burst - Only boosts raw and not elemental Flayer - Doesn't make it easier to create wounds Partbreaker - Doesn't increase damage of focus strikes  Elemental Ammo Tick Rate: Capping your FPS to 35 or 144 FPS gives you more Elemental Ammo Hits (7 instead of 5)   Info taken from Phemeto's latest video on Bowguns   Also a certain gigantic ice monster sometimes gets stuck between arena transitions and vibrates rapidly for a few minutes before it finally gets itself unstuck from the terrain.  If you have a good enough PC or are ok with some frustration along the way its a great MH game. Will change review once Capcom (hopefully) fixes these issues."
188913799,english,1,2246340,This game is a solid 10..... [spoiler] frames per second [/spoiler] on steam deck damn If you close your eyes it look nice  Steam Deck Terrified ✅
189625009,english,0,2246340,"As much as I enjoy the gameplay, I can't recommend it with the current performance issues. Remove Denuvo and work on increasing performance."
188992259,english,1,2246340,"Giving the game a bad review because of performance problems is fair, that said, beyond the technical issues. I am absolutely loving the game. If you enjoyed world and the betas you will love this as well."
188932474,english,0,2246340,Gameplay is great but the optimization is terrible. Frame gen should not be a requirement to hit 60fps. I've played games that look a lot better than Wilds and they ran so much better.
188915753,english,0,2246340,"Absolutely atrocious performance for how the game looks. Runs even worse than the beta. For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. The game does not look nearly good enough to warrant this performance. Everything is covered in a grimy texture with assets that look like you straight took them out of a PS3 game. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this. Embarrassing. Wait for a sale and/or optimization updates. I've played games on my Deck that look better than this. When I was kid I couldn't believe how good MHFU looked on my PSP, an entire world in my hands. And now they release a game like this. It saddens me the mediocrity that Capcom has fallen into. But what do I know, maybe I'm just a little silly billy and my 4070 toaster is just outdated at this point. Guess I'll go back to playing better looking games on ultra."
189138464,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. I have 3000+ hours across the recent titles. I played World/Iceborne on Playstation and then PC over again when the PC versions launched. I did the same for Rise/Sunbreak.  I want to preface that I've finished the main story & beaten every monster the game has to offer.   This game, wholeheartedly, is a downgrade in almost every aspect when compared to the previous titles. It's ""OK"" - but there's a lot of things that are just... bad decisions. They'll sell ""fixes"" through an expansion, like they did with Rise, but it's still NOT GOOD in the current state.  We lost SO many quality of life changes. ---------------------------------   Graphical downgrade and terrible optimization. The game looks brown. Everything looks brown. There's filters/settings enabled that just makes it look *bad* - Sometimes, like in the lush forest, it looks incredible when the fog is off... but everywhere else it looks washed out. The FPS is awful (There's a typo in the config file you can fix to add a little more) and you will struggle to get over 60 FPS on average/decent computers.  No idea what happened in testing.  ---------------------------------  Multiplayer is terribly implemented. There's lobbies, link parties, environment links, and a billion other things you need to juggle just to play with people. We seriously went from >make lobby >join lobby >post quests and play... to whatever this is. Even if you're IN THE ENVIRONMENT LINK WITH FRIENDS you still get disconnected sometimes after defeating a single monster. It makes no sense.   You're forced into 'cutscene gates' where you can't do things with people until you see certain things.. something that was FIXED in World because it was SO HATED AND ANNOYING. It's back! Playing with friends is ROUGH until you're at the end of the game.  ---------------------------------  The game is incredibly theme-parky and ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES exploration. You are tethered to certain areas while doing any story mode missions. World encouraged vertical exploration and players to go around on their own, but on here everything is listed, shown, and auto-pathed to by your mount.   There is no central hub, so it feels like you're constantly jumping around ""exhibits"" to find NPC's, quests, turn things in, and do whatever. It's very broken up, sparse, and feels incredibly clunky and jarring to navigate compared to the previous two titles (and even older ones). I guess they're adding a central hub eventually but didn't have enough time? Sucks.  It feels like they took Frontiers and mutilated it, trying to have an ""MMO FEEL"" without any MMO mechanics. I cannot tell you the number of times I've had to look everywhere to find where to turn in quests.   Even things like MAP MARKERS for camps are buried by other markers IN CAMPS and they're really difficult to see/fast travel to. The way the list of camps were shown in World made it *brain dead easy* to find... How did we go to this?  ---------------------------------  The story is very bland. I'd even say that it's awful. I won't go into spoilers or specifics, but there's absolutely no ""big catastrophe"" you're trying to avert or anything major that's being built up to.   Most of the dialogue is patronizing, condescending, or very ""life is special"" - and it just rings really hokey. There's also not even a dragonator anywhere in the entire game. I'd put it on the same level as ""base"" Rise's story, which says a lot.  There's very few memorable characters, moments, or anything along those lines. Part of what makes some of the story of the previous titles so good is how extra and over the top some of the characters are. Again, no dragonator moments.  It can also be completed in less than 10 hours without rushing. It just kinda.. ends.  ---------------------------------  The experience feels soulless. I dunno how else to put it other than feeling like nothing is inspired, and more like everything was ""lets do this again"" in Wilds. It feels like there was no vision beyond ""Make another World game"" and Capcom executives yelling at the developers to do so. The phrase I've heard a LOT of friends using (who are veterans of MH far longer than I am, since the original) is that it feels *incredibly* corporate.  You kinda just get it as a vibe. As you play through, the longer you play through, you'll understand what I mean.  ---------------------------------  Monster variety is very limited, and there's nothing really ""stand out"". Even the flagship monster is uninspired compared to previous title flagship monsters. Going through the entire game, killing every single monster available, I cannot think of a single one that impressed me or made me go ""woah"" on the same level of things like Vaal Hazak, Velkhana, Malzeno, Xeno'Jiiva, etc had to offer. It feels like you're fighting three archetypes the entire game.  A lot of monsters are repeats from previous games, including the movesets and skeletons (which have been used on a few of the new ones), which is a bit disappointing considering how few actually exist.  I'm actually worried about future content because most of the announced monsters are just filler/mid tier monsters... and the game's already done. The escalation wont be there unless they add things like Alatreon, etc, alongside smaller threats.  ---------------------------------  There's no endgame. You farm two or three tempered monsters at the end and that's it. There's no carrot on a stick to pursue and you'll be done as a dedicated player within a few days.  I won't go into extreme detail but yeah, nada.  ---------------------------------  Decorations are really weird now. Most attack based ones can only be put on weapons (Such as ballistics, etc), which means only 3 slot weapons can fit them. Three slot slots on armor/etc CANNOT wear the same decorations as weapons. This severely limits builds. Most armor sets also are just *incredibly* lackluster when it comes to skills provided.  I get this limits player power but.. it just feels really clunky on how they did it.  ---------------------------------  The entire new wound system is just clutch claw from Iceborne but way more auto-pilot. You do huge amounts of damage while wounding, get free materials, and CONSTANTLY KNOCK DOWN MONSTERS from applying wounds. There's fights you're going to do later once you're geared where monsters cannot get up off of the ground.   People complained about the clutch-claw gameplay and this is just the exact thing.. but WAY more  overtuned and broken. Even the hardest monsters the game has to offer kinda get destroyed by any sort of wound mechanic.  ---------------------------------  The food system is a downgrade. I get what they were going for but in simplifying it they've made it kinda awful. Getting materials sucks, the stores that sell/offer ingredients only seem to give you rations, and the bonuses from food are lackluster. We went from having major defense up, attack up, ammo conservation, and all these other awesome things to just basic buffs.   NOT TO MENTION THERE'S NO PALICO CUTSCENES FOR FOOD COOKING. RIP Grandma food cat.  ---------------------------------  The camera is awful. Monsters are bigger than your screen and tracking is bad. Can't count the number of times later that bigger monsters are just 95% of your screen and you can't see what they're doing fast enough. Even at max zoom/focus it's a downgrade from World.  ---------------------------------  I *want* this game to be better than it is and I know they'll make it better in the future, but man, I wouldn't be surprised if I see lots of people going back to play World/Iceborne after a couple of weeks of Wilds.  Monster Hunter fans will still find enjoyment in the game but the entire way through you'll probably be thinking ""I miss this"" or ""This is clunky"" or ""This was done better"" - and that's just sad to me."
190077988,english,0,2246340,"After two weeks since the game's release, I am still unable to play it at all. As far as I can tell, no patch has been released to fix these issues.

191081501,english,0,2246340,"For a €70 game in 2025, the optimization is seriously disappointing. Performance issues make it hard to enjoy, and for the price, that’s just not acceptable. I wouldn’t recommend this game."
189044542,english,0,2246340,"The game is really good, but the performance is horrible for most people; a lot of it can be traced to bad I/O and streaming. Some of it can be attributed to the overly active anti-tamper; there's more FPS correlation when installing the game on a fast NVMe SSD than having a 500 vs 1000 dollar GPU, which is ridiculous.  The game runs well on my machine but that's no excuse for how badly it runs on most machines, especially when this is a game that you play with friends. Avoid buying until you hear that Capcom has made the game actually run well on your machine; make sure to check with the benchmark before you buy. I won't be surprised if/when a crack comes out and the game runs way better with it."

189397727,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter is my childhood series of nearly 16 years,  [h1]Optimisations are not the sole issue.[/h1]  Performance [i]has been[/i] unnecessarily poor for many people. However, [b]fixing this will not solve the game's frustrating nature.[/b]  [h3]Visual design is great. Combat has been truly impeccable. However, every other sect of direction has lain the devil in the details, creating a grossly obstructive and discouraging experience while taking multiple steps back from the whole series. It's clear the game is unfinished.[/h3]  As a whole package, when only one of the main components established over 20+ years is done well and worthwhile side content is summed up by 'the fishing's kinda cool now', there is a huge problem.  So TL;DR: Roundabout and cluttered UI, [b]a gutting of series mechanics without fun, appropriate replacements[/b] and a story whose beats are brief and forgettable on purpose, yet is frustratingly paced, stretched and ground down rails like something worth telling - handholding far exceeding time actually spent hunting. Insult to injury comes from ignoring Rise for an obtuse multiplayer worse than World's painful 'leave and restart the quest to let friends join' system.   All to imprison you in a title whose major innovation is finally being open world for 'player freedom'.  [h2]So how does this begin to come together?[/h2]  On UI:  Try adding a friend you already know through this game without joining the same lobby. There's no dedicated ""Friends"" menu. You will probably take 10 minutes. Wanna play together? Go to the same lobby. Now you need a link party. Now you need to...  It is [i]all[/i] a sub menu jungle: poorly planned, explained and labelled.  More importantly, there's a HUD ripped from a 'corporate open world slop' mockup you'd find around Elden Ring's release. Most of it can be customised, but there's a beady, omnipresent and unremovable objective marker, duplicated on the un-customisable minimap telling you where everything is through visual barf; it all blends together.  [h3]These features are notorious for stealing your attention from a game. Perhaps forgivable elsewhere, but 2 of Monster Hunter's core components are attacked by this. One by being cheaply replaced. It actually [b]strips the series' special identity.[/b] [/h3]  [h2]What are they and why are they important then?[/h2]  1) [b]Preparation.[/b] Straight forward step. Pick out your items and equipment. Eat. Head out. It's a light strategic phase relying on memory and your personal preference. Without it you make life 10x harder.  2) [b]Scouting and foraging.[/b] Huge part of what makes MH special. Exploration and becoming familiar with a location, its details and secrets were given similar importance to learning the behaviors and patterns of the monster you hunted because of how they - and you - are intertwined. Your understanding is personal and ropes you into feeling part of the world. Since environmental hazards came out, this saw explicit gameplay reward too.  3) [b]Tracking.[/b] Before World it was your way to secure your combat reward for good scouting, with light management because paintballs wore off. World made it an additional reason to engage with the environment; how well it was done is up to interpretation.  4) [b]Combat and chase.[/b] Self explanatory. The meat of the game and main reward for locating the target monster.  You may notice these are simplified steps to actual hunting.   [h3]So which of these are attacked exactly?[/h3]  [b]Scouting:[/b] Immediately knowing where everything is defeats the need and incentive to explore. How the hell are we expected to care for cool spots we never discovered ourselves? Stray too far and the game yanks you away for daring to look at something new. Somehow they removed joy and wonder from higher tier environment design. At least they let us physically ignore 90% of the world by holding a button to laser focus on text in the most braindead iteration of gathering to ever grace us.  [b]Tracking:[/b] This is what's removed outright, replaced by the tacky magic objective marker. Tracks still exist but only give you currency. Scout flies became useless by World's endgame so that's why? [b]Well there's a clear rework they could've done:[/b]  Believe it or not sneak attacks and bushes exist as afterthoughts to some basic stealth system. If they wanted to remove tracking, [b]why wasn't the level design built with engaging stalking in mind, where some monsters only stayed to fight or could lose their special power if we snuck up on them first?[/b] What if our ""intelligent"" seikret could be taught to help with this? Why didn't they replace scoutflies with the raptor following scents?   Wanted to keep the flies and tracking anyway? Have them trained to only follow monsters tagged by paint for the whole hunt. Ruin hiding tactics or some amazing camouflage that's hard to see with the naked eye. It's reason to care about rain too.  Right now, only having prep for battle sounds like a glorified boxing ring. [b]""Monster Brawler"" is not the name of the series.[/b]  [h3]Anything else of value?[/h3]  Each of these are so far absent:  -Home customisation -Endemic life as pets -Mounts engaging in combat -Collectables -Raids  Cooking skill variety is pretty sad compared to every other game too.  MH games always offered 'extra'. (Raids would need improving)  [h2]But the combat's still good, right? How does this affect me?[/h2]  [h3]Lazy choices disrespecting core identity lead to lazy choices disrespecting you and this is present throughout. Not just in boring navigation, backwards menus or some nightmare 4-5 steps with recursive loop to playing multiplayer with friends. So how does combat fare...?[/h3]  [h1]Low Rank is Hell.[/h1]  The mind-numbing kind.  1) [b]A top complaint is hunts being too short.[/b] The devs failed to develop a new, fun, gameplay buildup to engage with before fighting, nor have they balanced the combat to really let you partake in this part's stellar system. 5-10 minutes when hours deep is immensely dissatisfying. It's a potato chip experience: tastes great but is gone too soon. Rise and World got it just right.  2) [b]Build crafting.[/b] Decorations are segregated on whether they're a 'weapon gem' or 'armor gem', removing creative slot management and the satisfaction of optimal builds how [i]you[/i] wanted. Very old games would add to one skill and take from another. Balancing that prevented OP builds better than this restrictive, over-corrective mess.  3) [b]Then there's the story.[/b] World let you breathe - Wilds crushes your windpipe. Progression for ~75% of your first 8-16Hrs is stuck in the most shallow, uninspired nothingburger drivel, forcibly handholding you throughout it all. Some interesting lore and that's it. Frequent are shacklings to tiny spaces just in case you wanted to - God forbid - play the game. Combine how [i]short[/i] the hunts are and the bore drills deep.  [h2]So what's the recurring problem here?[/h2]  [h3]Everything is designed to stop you engaging with the game, both implicitly and explicitly. Going so far as to hollow the experience out and prescribe you a narrow vision on how to interact until finally opening up by endgame. Dozens of hours in.[/h3]  Unlike any other MonHun, you can't really look, learn or enjoy outside combat. Minimal side content. Constant nags on where to go, where to stand, who to speak to and when play's allowed between each. And every. Quest... Sounds like a school - that fun to you?  And it's tragic because there are cool, fun little details with beauty to witness. Again, combat is fantastic. But for all these efforts to make the game worth playing, someone in Capcom's out of touch management either refused to let the game cook or stirred the pot, thinking MH as 'just another action game' when the legs are built on so much more. Now sloppy and missing features encroach on what gives it character.  World:Iceborne remains king. Sunbreak is queen."

188939251,english,0,2246340,"AMD BEWARE  I generally dislike leaving negative reviews when a game just released because I'm afraid it'll seem like jumping on the ""hate the popular thing"" bandwagon etc. However. The perfomances are one thing I can ignore, it doesn't run good but it runs well enough on my machine, I can wait for updates for that  What I cannot ignore however is the inability of the game working on top of the line AMD GPUs, I have a 7900XT and the game crashed on startup, until I figured I had to turn on WINDOWS 7/8 COMPATIBILITY MODE IN THE EXECUTABLE PRORIETIES   And that's where the huge problem lies, if you turn on Comp mode, half of the textures shit themselves, I'm not talking about a lttle artifact here and there, I'm talking about a MASSIVE artifact covering the ENTIRE screen as soon as there's a rock in frame, this is unnacceptable especially for the flagship product of a company  And you cannot turn it off once you booted, you'd think maybe the issue was shaders compiling, or something But no. Turning off comp mode brings the game back to crash on startup  I still put up with it considering it's either that or no monstie at all, but the review is a solid negative and will stay as is until the problem get hotfixed.  AMD BEWARE unless you're ready to have your eyes bleed. For now at least.  Those armour sets are banging though."
189223176,english,0,2246340,"This might get drowned out by all the reviews about performance, but there are many issues I had with the game past that.  Difficulty: I used pc controls and the lance for the first time for my playthrough and didn't even need to craft armor until Guardian Doshagama, going from 11 defense to 131. From there it was a cake walk just by using what random materials I had from doing quests, even beating a tempered Arkveld right after beating the main story with no problem still using random bs. I understand wanting to make a game accessible to all skill levels, but doing it to this degree gives most players no reason to interact with the open world at all during the story, and considering the lack of postgame, basically invalidates the open world as a whole.  Weapon and combat changes: Counter reliance is bad for monster hunter, and every weapon has some form of counter in this game, with certain weapons revolving around spamming counters now. Plus, certain overtuned attacks have made some weapons lose nuance in gameplay, and in conjunction with wound attacks, makes the combat feel really spammy. Also, the combination of wounds, clashes, and offsets really thrashes the monsters around, making even returning threats feel more pathetic than ever. The majority of combat changes seem to prioritize making the game more cinematic and satisfying over giving it mechanical depth, which I can enjoy for one game, but I hope that design philosophy is a one time thing. [Additional minor nitpick: what kind of logic makes wounds go away when you hit them, and makes it so you can only do certain combos if you start them by hitting a wound?]  Content and pacing: I beat every main quest, side quest, and monster available at launch in 27~ hours of gameplay, and I wasn’t really in much of a rush. What’s arguably worse is that you pretty much fight the final boss in low rank, and the entirety of high rank feels like postgame, with its final fight being a rematch from low rank. Then, there is basically no actual post game other than fighting a handful of tempered monsters harder than what you get from doing the main high rank quests.  Monsters: The new monsters are fine. Since it's a subjective topic, all I care to mention is that the movesets of some seem shallow, and many of their moves plus the new moves given to old monsters seem poor at indicating the direction and space they’re gonna take up. I also think they lack the charm found in many classic monster hunter monsters, but that can be applied to monsters from rise and world as well.  The environment: It's decent, which is devastating in comparison to how amazing the locales were in world. Not including graphical issues, it can be ugly and dark and boring at times, but can certainly be beautiful, especially in the ruins. However, the level of creativity pales in comparison to the fantastical coral highlands and rotten veil. Even the clever use of every single imaginable shape and form of ice in the hoarfrost impressed me more than anything shown in this game. Plus, the endemic life was kind of lame, with many of them being slightly altered, real world lizards. Also, having to catch something for a quest that I already caught previously was annoying.  My general opinion: This game is deeply disappointing to me, not because it's objectively bad, but because I expected much more. It seems like they learned from the feedback given to world, but forgot a lot of what they did to make that game as good as it was in the first place. Also, as I was playing, many aspects of the game seemed like a collection of many good-but-underdeveloped ideas, lacking the depth and attention to detail I was looking forward to from this team. Aside from negative feelings, I was able to make a decent amount of fun of it, but cannot recommend buying this game before beating the majority of worldborne."
192319039,english,0,2246340,"What's so strange about this game is, they've sanded it down with the intent of finding an even broader audience, but the result would be mystifying to me if I was a new player. The game picks a healing item for me automatically, so what is the point of the plethora of different healing items? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) Sharpening my weapon just amounts to pressing a button whenever I remember it, so what is the point of the sharpening mechanic? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) You can beat any fight with any equipment, so what is the point of all these complicated weapon stats? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) It feels like, if Capcom were designing this game from scratch, 75% of these systems wouldn't even be in it. Because they all add friction and Capcom doesn't want there to be any friction any more. In that sense, it's kind of a mess.  Beyond that, the point about the equipment sums up how Wilds has broken the loop that made previous MH games so satisfying (already an issue in Rise but absolutely terminal here). Your impetus for hunting the same monsters again and again is supposed to be that you NEED those materials to win your next fight – and you need to master your weapon for the same reason. But in Wilds none of that matters. I will admit that combat feels great. But WINNING doesn't feel great, because it's no longer the culmination of anything except mashing buttons. The reason I want a real challenge isn't to prove how skilled I am, it's because a challenge makes you engage with the game more deeply, and so gives you a richer, more sustained experience, which you think about even when you're not playing. Without that, you're left with a nicer-looking but much shallower retread of Monster Hunter World, and that hasn't been worth £60 to me. And even if they redeem it to an extent through title updates and DLC, that won't restore purpose to all these legacy mechanics that now drag behind the game like a dead limb."
190858070,english,0,2246340,"It's a fun game. The combat feels nice. The new monster designs are all awesome, and the game's open world has serious potential.  But the frog has been boiled. What started as ""Quality of Life"" changes in World have slowly morphed the series into something totally different than what I think of when I think of Monster Hunter. So many legacy mechanics feel like they're in the game due to obligation. The Seikret trivializes mid-hunt maintenance, I had basically unlimited Mega Potions, Barrel Bombs, anything I needed, and without the need to gather materials or craft much. No more tracking. Wounding makes Hit-Zones irrelevant. The game does everything in it's power to push you back into combat,  which is also easier than it's ever been and is no longer about thoughtful positioning and commitment. Just sit on your Seikret and let it autopilot you to your destination. I did not fail a single quest my entire play-through. I had fun, but I am sad to see the series give up on it's own identity."

Having a NEW release looking worse than it's 2018 Worlds and not being able to run smoothly - developers deserve a long wooden log shoved right in their greedy arseholes. having 3080 with barely 60 fps in a desert landscape while Worlds offered so much in just first 5 minutes needing less and looking better says a lot of today's state of the industry. Dragon's Dogma incident repeated. You do not deserve the love from the MH community Capcom. You do not.   After more hours i keep my review negative as people think it would change anything. No. Game looks like ass, runs like ass. Shimmer cause by dlss, frame generation on ground, can't run in native resolution without AI upscalers.

189505316,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is a great game ... just not yet and hopefully with some updates my review might change.  The Good  Let’s start with the positives. Visually, Wilds is stunning. Its environments are beautifully crafted, and the combat remains impeccable, carrying forward the deep, rewarding mechanics that define the series. The thrill of the hunt is still here, with weapons feeling satisfying to use and monsters providing exhilarating challenges.  The fishing is also kinda cool now. (Yes, that’s actually a highlight.)  The Issues  However, despite its strengths, Wilds stumbles in nearly every other aspect. Performance has been unnecessarily poor for many players, and while optimizations will likely come in future patches, they won’t fix the game’s more fundamental problems. Wilds takes multiple steps back from the series' core identity, creating an experience that is frustratingly obstructive and unfinished.  UI and Navigation  The user interface is a mess. Something as simple as adding a friend without joining the same lobby is an ordeal. The game’s multiplayer is somehow more obtuse than World’s already clunky system, requiring unnecessary steps just to play with friends.  The HUD is cluttered with unnecessary markers and information overload, stealing attention from the world and combat. Instead of immersing players, it bombards them with visual noise that detracts from exploration.  Loss of Core Monster Hunter Identity  Monster Hunter has always been about preparation, scouting, tracking, and finally engaging in combat. Wilds strips away these core gameplay elements in favor of shallow, modern open-world tropes.  Scouting is undermined by objective markers that tell you exactly where everything is, removing the joy of discovery.  Tracking is gone, replaced by an ever-present magic marker that directs you to your target without effort.  Exploration is actively discouraged, as the game yanks you back if you stray too far.  Combat, while still strong, is hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of hand-holding.  Rather than enhancing the experience, these changes reduce Monster Hunter to a streamlined action game, stripping away the depth that made past titles special.  Low-Rank Experience and Story  Early-game progression is a slog. Hunts are too short, often lasting only 5-10 minutes, making combat feel rushed rather than rewarding. Build crafting has been oversimplified with restrictive gem slotting, eliminating the creativity and satisfaction of optimizing a setup.  The story, meanwhile, is both forgettable and frustratingly intrusive. Unlike World, which gave players room to breathe, Wilds constantly shackles players with excessive handholding, preventing them from engaging with the game on their own terms. The first 10 hours feel like a prolonged tutorial, suffocating any sense of freedom.  What’s Missing?  Many beloved features from past games are either absent or underwhelming:  No home customization  No endemic life as pets  No meaningful mounts in combat  No significant collectibles  No raids  Cooking lacks variety compared to previous titles  These missing elements further dilute the experience, making the world feel emptier and less engaging.  The Verdict  Monster Hunter Wilds has immense potential. Its combat remains excellent, and its world is breathtaking. However, its misguided design choices, frustrating UI, lack of core Monster Hunter elements, and poor pacing make it a difficult game to recommend at launch. If Capcom can address these issues through updates and expansions, Wilds could eventually become a worthy successor to past titles."
189796037,english,1,2246340,"The game's optimization could use some work. Frame rate drops and occasional stuttering are present even on high-end systems. There are also crashes caused by Frame Generation. That said, the combat in MH Wilds is fantastic, it is very fluid, strategic, and incredibly satisfying, with a variety of weapons and monster interactions. Despite the optimization issues, MH Wilds is still a fantastic title and worth checking out."

190185699,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds had a lot to live up to, especially after the success of World and Rise. After spending over 60 hours in the game, I have a lot of thoughts. Some things are fantastic, others are frustrating, and a few are just downright disappointing.  At its core, Wilds is still a Monster Hunter game, which means the thrill of the hunt is there. The weapons feel great, the monsters are well-designed, and the gameplay can be really fun. But… there are some major issues that hold it back. So let’s break it down.  Gameplay - Fun in Its Own Way Monster Hunter Wilds delivers a solid gameplay experience that feels unique and engaging. Despite its flaws, I find myself enjoying the core mechanics, and there’s definitely a lot of potential here.  Weapon Improvements - A Step Forward One of the best things about Wilds is the weapon system. Every weapon feels like a refined and improved version of its Monster Hunter World counterpart. The movesets, mechanics, and overall polish make them incredibly satisfying to use.  Combat - Slow and Clunky Compared to Rise Coming from Monster Hunter Rise, the combat in Wilds feels painfully slow. Rise had a level of fluidity that made the hunts exciting and dynamic, whereas Wilds feels sluggish in comparison. It doesn’t even come close to the sheer fun factor I experienced in Rise.  Multiplayer - No Real Sense of Community Technically, there are plenty of ways to communicate, but the problem is nobody does. The game doesn’t naturally bring players together for multiple hunts; instead, it has this vague ""join a party"" option, which almost nobody uses.  Right now, it's basically: play with real-life friends or hunt alone with randoms who join through the SOS system. There’s no real way to meet new players organically, no sense of community where you can team up for an entire evening, discuss tactics, or just chat about real life. The old hub system encouraged bonding and teamwork—Wilds completely lacks that, and it really hurts the multiplayer experience.  Graphics - Unacceptable for the System Requirements The visuals are an absolute disaster considering how demanding the game is. It feels like a downgrade from Monster Hunter World—everything looks blocky and grainy. At first, I thought it was an issue on my end, but after checking the forums, I realized this is a widespread problem. For a big company like Capcom, this is just unacceptable. My PC is well above the recommended requirements, yet the game still looks underwhelming.  Modding - Almost a Necessity As it stands, mods feel like a requirement to make the game look decent. The fact that the community has to step in and fix visual issues that shouldn’t exist in the first place is frustrating.  Typos in the Config Files?! This one is just baffling. There are actual typos in the config .ini files. It’s a small issue, but it speaks volumes about the lack of polish in some areas.  Final Verdict Despite all its issues, the gameplay itself is REALLY good. But right now, it just barely makes up for the game's many shortcomings. Capcom needs to step up and fix these problems, because as it stands, Wilds is a flawed but enjoyable experience."
189122412,english,1,2246340,"This is my first monster hunter game. I spent about 20 hours in the various beta tests. during my time in the beta tests i went from saying ""i've decided this game isn't for me"" to being one of the ones who stayed up way too late on launch night to finally get to play it again. It took me a bit of time to get accustomed to the controls and figure out how to use my character, but once i had it, it hooked me.  is it a perfect game? no. it has its problems. but for the most part the problems are more nuisances than anything. To be fair, i have a fairly high end PC built in 2019, and i upgraded my graphics card to a 4080 a couple years ago. I haven't had any problems with performance so far. i feel bad for those that are having issues, but my experience has been virtually flawless.  Since this is my first monster hunter i can't really compare it to older monster hunter games. I will say that so far i have enjoyed learning the combat, learning monster patterns and finding new tricks and traps along the way. I have not completed the game, so i have not started into end game, but i don't foresee many problems in end game for my type of play. i don't mind grinding games. i have nearly 700 hours into granblue fantasy relink on PS5 and 200 - 300 in granblue fantasy relink on steam. i enjoy grinding and getting more powerful. so i anticipate the end game will be just fine for me. i will edit my review if that changes.  the couple of problems i have with the game are fairly minor. i get tired of monsters running away. and sometimes running for miles before finally stopping; even when they are near death. it gets so old trying to chase them down as your fully healthy bird can't even catch up with something that is hobbling and stumbling away with broken legs and wounds all over it.  the other problem is with trying to get into a group with friends. the system is beyond complicated. private lobbies are not easy to use and very complex for your friends to try to join. link parties aren't well explained and make no real sense. squads seem to be something akin to guilds. my friend and i are greatly confused every time we try to pair up. joining a lobby with each other often leads to us not being able to see one another. also, even if we are in the same lobby we aren't able to do quests together, you need to be in a link party for that (maybe? since i really don't have a clue) so it's to the point where we join a squad, a lobby, a link party, and then start a quest. for quests in the storyline if you are trying to do the campaign together, you can fight the monsters as a pair, but its janky. when fighting campaign monsters whoever joins the other one gets sent back to the main camp and from there they have to run all the way to the monster to take part in the quest. a monster that is probably half dead by the time you manage to join their quest and load their version of the map and run from camp to the monster; very cumbersome.   i have no doubt that these things will be slowly ironed out over time. it's too bad they weren't solved before launch, but ultimately it doesn't take enough away from the game for me to stop playing it. i am completely enjoying my experience in monster hunter wilds so far and i look forward to putting in many more hours."

188944350,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wild Review: A Great Game Ruined by Poor Performance  Monster Hunter Wild offers fantastic gameplay that stays true to the series' core, but its performance is a massive letdown. Despite having a high-end PC, the game runs as if you're on standard hardware, completely undermining the investment in top-tier equipment. As a long-time fan, it's disappointing to see such potential wasted by technical issues. I can't recommend this game until significant performance improvements are made."
189320522,english,1,2246340,"Granted. I'm only about 14 hours into the game (realistically 10 hours discounting idle time), I don't know if I can recommend this game in it's current state. I'm running a Ryzen 7600X, 7800 XT, 32 gigs of 6000MT/s ram, and 60fps 1440p native is certainly not locked even WITHOUT ray tracing AND with some performance enhancing changes to the game's configuration file. The high res texture DLC exceeds 16 gigs vram and increases CPU utilization to hit 100% frequently, so I just leave textures at High rather than Very High.  So.... with all this in mind, I'm running the game on an SDR 1080p projector with everything turned up to ultra +rt with FSR nativeAA and having a very smooth, somewhat blurry but still buttery experience.    Performance aside....  +Combat is good +Weapons feel familiar and powerful +Monsters look amazing and intimidating +Doen't feel grindy, repeating missions is fun. The loop is real and never unfun +The core gameplay is simply addicting af +If you came here to kill monsties and wear their remains... this is the game  -THEY GOT RID OF THE CANTEEN! NO MORE PALICO COOKS! WTAF CAPCOM?? -Auto running Seikret mounts are somewhere between convenient and a gameplay sabotaging mechanic (maybe I'm misunderstanding how to control them) -I miss Palamutes, the gathering area, a lot of the home base features from Rise -Story heavy content is not engaging. Discovering lore is not rewarding, dialogue is bloated, and I don't care about this kid or his village. Sorry, not sorry.  -Graphics are meh especially for how much strain they put on hardware -This ditsy blonde smithy works red hot metal in a crop top, and has long ass hair near grinding wheels and large spinning gears like she wants to get scalped with 3rd degree burns, just saying -This game is $70  If you have the best hardware, go for it. If you love MH, go for it. If you are just looking for a new fun game... look elsewhere. It's a good game for those whole know what they are getting into.      +30 hour Update: I've made it all the way to end credits. I repeated a few missions several times. Never got old. It does feel sort of bad to hit end game so soon for a $70, but Monster Hunter always has a ton of end game content that I am looking forward to get into. My system never crashed FYI even tho others report differently. I played exclusively in single player online. Just a few additional thoughts to add.  +Ray tracing performance hit is way less than many other games, in my experience anyway. Typically its a 1-10% fps decrease from off to high on my AMD GPU +Some characters become more likable. I would have appreciated more interaction with Olivia especially +The monsters get so much better in the last half of the game. They were already good, the last handful of fights were super fun  -I do not like the Seikret mounts! Aesthetically, behaviorally, and in gameplay they are inferior to Palamutes -As a long sword and switch axe user.... combat was more dynamic and fun in Rise. Wirebugs had my flying around the screen doing insane combos and damage while staying out of danger -""Mount and strike the monstie"" is inferior to Rise's ""mount and drive the monstie"" mechanic  Sorry for the long exposition. TLDR- Good game. Gameplay good, not best of MH. Needs performance patches. Needs palico cooks."
189274464,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter World is my favorite game of all time, I have over one thousand hours logged on steam. So to say I was excited for Wilds and all the changes is an understatement.   I have just submitted a refund request for Wilds, as even on fully LOW settings with DLSS performance mode my 3070/Ryzen 7 7800x3D/32gb 6000mhz build is not enough to reach a stable 60 fps in what is genuinely the WORST looking game I have played in recent memory. The game looks terrible. Which is honestly not a deal breaker, but it also FEELS terrible. Constant frame drops during hunts and in the village areas make what is already a poor experience an unplayable one. Even switching to FSR and enabling frame gen DOES NOT HELP, as I can peak 90 fps but still chug down to 30 when turning my character around, making the dips even more jarring.   Monster Hunter World looks gorgeous, miles better than Wilds, and runs at a rock solid 120+ fps, no dips, no stutters, no smeary PS2 textures, and no ai upscaling or generated frames.  Elden Ring, a beautiful open world game runs buttery smooth with visuals that put this game to shame.  Sadly both World and Elden Ring had performance issues at launch that had to be addressed through multiple patches, which seems to be the industry standard now. Hopefully the same happens with Wilds, but until then please DO NOT buy this game. Save yourself the time, energy, and money. I spent 2+ hours fiddling with settings and updating drivers for nothing.  I want to love this game, I really do, but in its current state I wouldn't play it even if it was free. Please do better Capcom"
189024025,english,1,2246340,"Aside from the optimization, this game is amazing. Hopefully they release a patch to optimize it so it isn't terrible for people without high end pcs. Runs fine for me, RADEON RX 7700XT and AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, but i can definitely see the bad perf on worse specs."
190519181,english,1,2246340,From the little time I've been playing MH Wilds I can say that i'm having a fun time hunting.  My enjoyment from the game reminds me and is comparable to when i played MH World I love both games but i do have to say that MH Wilds has its issues so i hope the issues get addressed sooner rather than later.   The game has so much potential and I'm excited for future monsters and collabs!!!
188977098,english,0,2246340,"Extremely promising game, but the performance and lack of optimization makes every form of good will garnered from the gameplay obsolete as the frame rate and stuttering is unbareable.   The recommended specs to run this game that the developers had provided is completely inaccurate and more accurately represents the minimum requirements to play the game. The recommended specs would get 30 fps on the best of days. With an i5-14400F, RTX 4060, and 64 GB of RAM this game STRUGGLES to maintain 60 fps and often sits at 45 fps on high settings at 1080p. Even lowering the graphics quality does not consistently improve frame rate."
189619533,english,0,2246340,"I really wanted this game to be good. I built a new PC primarily just to play this, so I won't speak of the performance issues as they didn't affect me at all. And there were also some positive things that stand out. Weapons feel smoother to play than ever, thanks to focus mode allowing to readjust where you are hitting, being able to skip the quest end countdown is something that was finally added as well, etc. But even considering that, there are just too many issues to wholeheartedly recommend the game.  My main grievances are:  1. Hunters have too much control. Thanks to the wound system basically adding a free stagger that any weapon can initiate at will so long as there is a wound makes the monsters look like clowns. Hunting Arkveld, the currently ""toughest"" monster in the game, is more akin to watching slapstick comedy. Between wound breaks, offset attacks, power clashes, flashes, regular topples, and natural traps if you use them, the monster spends more time on the ground or standing still than actively fighting. This also leads to hunts rarely taking longer than 10 minutes, usually averaging 7 at most.  2. Monsters are not dangerous anymore. If a monster does actually manage to break out of a hunters CC chain, it is till no threat. Be it the generally low damage of monster attacks, the lack of blights, wind pressure, and god forbid tremor (a literal landwhale belly flop and we don't get tremored standing next to it?), there's nothing a well timed offset attack of guard doesn't solve.  3. You cannot repeat the coolest fight in the game. [spoiler]You fight Zoh Shia once at the end of LR and that's it? No way to repeat the quest, no optional, no HR variant? We can't wear it's skin or use it's weapons? I'm sure i can hear the designers crying because they didn't get to make a nephilim themed armour with the whole Black and white theme going on in the fight.[/spoiler]  4. The absolute state of skills. I think the idea of taking a new approach to weapon and armour skills is nice. But the execution is severely lacking.  Locking certain weapons into a skill that is just objectively unusable on it is ridiculous (looking at you, crit draw lances).  But even if the skill would be usable, it might just straight up not work because a lot of them are bugged (e.g. Critical Element, Burst for HBG, ...). Locking a weapon into a specific skill is too restrictive either way in my opinion, but that's subjective.  5. The artian system feels very lacklustre. These weapons are the best in the game for the most part. The actual look of the weapons is at best mid though, especially compared to the other weapons in the game which are absolute peak design. And even if artian weapons have different elements, they all look the same. The way you build them as well feels very shallow and not engaging at all. It never makes sense not to go for element, there is no downside to just going 3 of the same element, you can't forgo element for a boost in raw/crit/sharpness or whatever. You always aim for the same thing. And when enhancing, you mostly just hope for a bunch of attack. And if you are unlucky, all you have to do is chuck the weapon into the ether and try again.  6. There is basically no endgame grind. The artian stuff feels like it was chucked on at the end just to have an excuse for an endgame. But in reality, parts are readily available from tempered quests that take no longer than regular hunts. If you are not planning on making a weapon of every type and element, you'll be done in no time at all. Same goes for decorations. It is obvious that the focus of grinding was supposed to be on something different compared to World. This in turn means, that getting all decorations is very quickly done as well, assuming RNGesus doesn't hate you. There is also no new mantles to unlock. You get a grand total of 4 thrown at you during the story and that's it. No doing all optional quests for a new mantle. Nothing.  While writing this review, I realised that some of these decisions may be to make the barrier of entry for new players to the series easier. But I feel like that is no excuse to leave existing fans of the series by the wayside. In World, i really enjoyed struggling with my friends to find a way to beat a certain monster, or a hunt coming down to the wire with 2 unfortunate carts. I enjoyed finding ways to make certain grinds faster with the variety of tools we had at hand. Finding something new to work towards way into the endgame. In Wilds, there's just nothing.  This game left a void in me. I was looking forward to it. I enjoyed playing through the story, albeit it feeling too easy, but I told myself ""Surely it will get harder in HR/Endgame"". And then I get to the end of HR. I beat Arkveld again. I am excited for what is to come when I hit HR50. What fight will be next? Will we get an elder dragon to fight? Zoh Shia again? What are these artian weapons preparing me for? And then ... nothing. I am left sitting in a mountain of unused relics, decorations and artian weapons. Okay, maybe it's HR60 this time around. I check. Nothing. There's nothing else to do. Hunt Arkveld 30 more times to reach HR100 to unlock more melding that I don't even need? That's it. That's the game done.  It may sound like I don't like the game. That couldn't be further from the truth. I still love the game, I see the vision, and I am looking forward to what the game will become in the future. But right now, I just cannot give the game a positive review. I will revisit this review once we see some more content and these issues addressed.  If you've read this far, thank you for tolerating my rambling. I'm done yelling into the void now."
189877669,english,0,2246340,"[h3]Not recommended with its current state (v1.0).[/h3]  It's a good game (not great). My overall rating is 7/10. Wait until Title Update 4~5 first before buying. Some points of the review is in comparsion with the base game World and Rise when they were first released.  First thing I'm gonna say is what I really like about the game. [list]     [*]Focus Mechanic - With Focus Aim you can freely aim anywhere now. This helps a lot especially melee weapons.     [*]Offset Attacks and Power Clashes - Great way of parrying monster attacks and addition to perfect guards.     [*]Slinger Gathering - No need to go the herbs and pick them up.     [*]New way of story progression. Not just: Hub - Post Hub Quest - Hunt. [/list]  With all the stuff below I hope all of them will get fixed and improve in the future updates!  [b]1. Optimization Issues.[/b] Game doesn't use the latest DLSS & DirectStorage versions for better and stable performance. For texture loading problems, it's as stated by one of the modders as well that capcom devs avoided using RAM/VRAM by streaming things when needed from storage instead of at boot time. All of these has been fixed by modders. And I hope Capcom will fix this on their side.  [b]2. Pop-Up Camps.[/b] There are a lot of QoL improvements but there are some changes that are questionable like the pop-up camps. What's the point of pop-up camps getting destroyed if you just need 75 points to fix them? And with the maps that are much larger than previous Monster Hunter games why not just make all the camps available and not have a limit of five. I do like that you can customize the camps now.  [b]3. Bad UX Design.[/b]  [b]First Alma (Quest/Lobby NPC)[/b] Before with the fixed Hub you always know where to go when you want to do a hunt or do something with the lobby. Because the NPC will not move and the NPC will always be there. Right now at least maybe more than half of the time since your Handler is the same as the Hub NPC, with her coming along with you on hunts, She will not always be beside the Base Camp Tent. She will most of the time walk around the Base Camp and you need to go look for her in order for you to interact with her.  [b]There is no bell sound anymore when someone posts a hunt in the lobby.[/b] Right now in order for you to get notified, when someone posted a hunt is through link party. Link party is good I'll be honest even when you are not in the same lobby you can still hunt with other link party members. But when you and your friends are in the same lobby and not in a link party there is no other way to know that someone posted a hunt aside from saying it through VC if you are in a call or manually typing it in game.  [b]Layered Armor/Equipment[/b] Back in MH World when we got Layered Armor you could link your layered armor set with the equipment loadout you are equipping. But now in order for you to change equipment appearance you need to get out of the Change Equipment and Navigate to Equipment Appearance. This is about 10 button presses average if your equipment appearance loadout is in the first page. Also for the Appearance Menu, they should move the Change Appearance below the Equipment Appearance because you will not always change how your character(face) will look. When changing equipment appearance, me and most people I know accidentally pressed this most of the time instead of moving down below first. For listed menu designs you will always put first the ones that will mostly be chosen to the least one.   In MH Rise the Layered Loadouts are in the Equipment Loadouts already. Even though they are not linked you can just switch between Equipment and Layered with LB/RB or L1/R1. They introduced Hunter Loadouts in Title Update 4 in Rise though. This is a loadout with equipment and layered link and an additional link for item loadout. This is really great especially for gunners since they have different ammos for different weapons.  [b]Raising Kinsect[/b] There is no Kinsect Tree. In order for you to know which Kinsect is better is after you nurture all of them. Back in World there are three tabs when you are crafting/updraging equipment and raising a kinsect. These are the list , tree and zoom view. Right now the one for Kinsect is default into a list view only.  [b]No Abandon Quest/No Mantle Reset on each Quest/Investigation[/b] I get that mantles will continue to cooldown when you are doing a Field Survey but when you are doing a specific quest or investigation from Alma the cooldown should reset. This specific review is not for everyone. But mainly who do speedruns or testing some things on a specific quest. The only available option now is ""Return from Quest"" and doing that uses up everything that you did during the quest (i.e. might pill or traps). You need to replenish the items everytime you do the run again. You also need to wait for the mantles to cooldown. Thus making it inefficient to do runs.   [b]No Copy Lobby/Hunter ID[/b] This is a simple feature to add and the Copy Session ID was already present in the Communication menu in World. There was also a shortcut key to view the Player List before in World when view the menu.  [b]Chat Log Notifications and how it disrupts viewing the Map[/b] The game taught us and it has always been the select key to view the map even from the previous game. In Wilds if there are monster notifications in chat, the select key will be the shortcut to skip the monster and to view the map you need to hold the start key. Every UX Designer knows that this is just bad for ""Navigation Familiarity""  [b]4. Story and Progression[/b] We all know that playing Monster Hunter games is always been the never ending hunting of monsters so I am fine with the story being so simple. I like how the story progresses now than before where you post the main story quest in hub and depart on the quest. I think they are moving close to a RPG type of main story progression with the maps connected to each other. And with locked out paths when you are being accompanied by NPC when you guys are riding a Seikret. And speaking of Seikret...  [b]5. Seikret[/b] Seikret AI is kinda junky at the moment. For sure this will be fixed in the future. Palamutes are the best. Change my mind.  [b]6. Endgame Stuff[/b] [table]     [tr]         [th]Game[/th]         [th]Deco[/th] 	[th]Talisman[/th] 	[th]Weapon Aug[/th]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]World[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]Selectable Augments[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Rise[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Selectable Ramp Upgrades, you can ramp up upgrades every weapon not only rampage weapons[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Wilds[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG, you can only reinforce Artian Weapons (Can save scum)[/td]     [/tr] [/table]  Right now base endgame hunting, there is only one monster that is worth hunting with the rewards. And that is mostly Arkveld. For full hunt rewards he will get paired up with a random monster and that is a way for you to hunt a different monster aside from him. Half of my saved investigations are Arkveld since other monsters don't have the same amount of rewards. The other half are those monsters with their Gem as rewards. But if you already crafted a lot of equipments that needs a monster gem. You will just go back to Arkveld.  Back in Base World you could always hunt almost every monster in High Rank since you are looking for Investigations with Gold Rewards and every monster investigation can have that reward. Also why couldn't we fight [spoiler]Zoh Shia again. There's no available investigation you couldn't repeat assigned quests.[/spoiler]  [b]Bounties.[/b] Before you could select bounties (optional subquests in Rise) that you want to do while hunting. And then choose a different bounty when you finish them. Now there is only Limited Bounty and they only reset weekly afaik."
190885605,english,0,2246340,"Never in my mind did I ever think I'd have to, at any point in my life, write a negative review for a monster hunter game. As a disclaimer - I am not a hater. I LOVE the franchise. Started back in Tri, buying the game completely by accident. Just by the art on the cover box, having no idea what I am getting into.  I fell in love with it, despite it's clunkyness and the game doing a poor job of explaining itself, but, by the time I finally fell my first Great Jaggi, I was hooked. The constant gameplay loop of killing a big monster, to make gear out of it, to prepare myself for yet another, even stronger monster - it's a magical code for my brain that keeps me coming back to this series.  BUT... It's not present in this one. Game has amazing fundamentals. The movement never felt this good. The weapon movesets have never been this fluid.  It's just a shame that all of it doesn't really matter, when the core aspect of a ""monster hunter"" game has been streamlined OUT of the game and now it's just a generic ""monster fighter"".  Where as the series started as a ""hunting expierience"" with player having to commit on every step, because there were stakes - now there are no stakes and no commitment. Before, you had to prepare your pouch for the hunt, carefully chosing items and stocking up on them. You had to position well during combat, because if you just go out swinging hands, at best you could whiff an attack and deal no damage, at worst you would get punished by the monster and get hit instead (and remember, your amount of potions on a hunt was limited, so you're being tested my friend).  Now, no matter if im running Dual Blades or Great Sword, as long as I am in range of the monster, it's gonna ALWAYS land, thx to the FOCUS mode, which ironically makes your brain lose focus, kinda zone out and let your hands just go through the motions. Feeling like you're fighting on autopilot, completely disengaged. Add to it the wound mechanic, which lets you stunlock the monster. The Palico that makes sure you don't have to bring healing items ever again and magically lays down a trap exactly at the moment that the monster is capturable. All those little things, and suddenly the game fails to provide any challenge. I could go on and on, but big content creators are finally catching up to what I've been heralding since World came out (because World started the trend, but wasn't nearly as sinful as this is) and they have already said everything.  Mechanics such as wind pressure, tremors, seem to not exist. They probably do but I finished all the content (which is not a lot if you skip all the cutscenes and if you COULD skip all the walkie-talkie sections) and I don't remember wind pressure/tremors or such things happening at all. Now - before you come at me, I did watch all the cutscenes, I didn't skip a single one of them, but my friend wanting to catch up to me, did, and he finished ""the story"" in 7 hours, where as I did so in around 20, and it's never a good sign if 13 hours out of your entire 20 for A GAME are filled with cutscenes.   I keep seeing these claims of the game's director that MH Wilds is a great success because of the story... No my friend. It's a great success despite the story, and mostly because World was a huge success. You are kind of getting the benefit of the doubt here, but you are quickly burning it.  This game has very little to do with what an actual ""Monster Hunter"" series was always about.  Expierience-wise: It's a game about hunting monsters, and as a hunter, preparing traps, tracking, doing what a hunter does. Gameplay-wise: Fight a monster, get it's parts, craft better armor, to be able to fight a bigger monster - that is what we would call ""gameplay loop"" in video game design, sadly, it's non-existant here.  Monster Hunter has lost it's soul and it's an extremly sad thing to witness. Because this used to be one of my most beloved things in the world, alongside Zelda, Mario, Metroid, all these big, passion-filled creations. And now, one of them is getting destroyed.   I might stick around to see Wilds getting it's G-rank expansion, but If the series doesn't change the course to revert some of it's streamlining, this might be the last monster hunter game I ever play."
188928667,english,0,2246340,"I was crashing a TON on a high-end rig, but changed my XMP profile in BIOS to normal, reverting my RAM to its normal speed, and the crashes are almost non-existent now.  Hoping they keep working on fixing performance issues so every hunter, old and new, can have a smooth and fun experience with this game, cus it is REALLY fun. Will change to positive after they address these glaring issues.  I think Wilds improves upon World in almost every way. The combat feels great with the new additions. The music and sound design are spectacular. Monster designs are REALLY cool so far. I don't care too much about the open-world aspect. It's kinda cool, but zones have always been fine. Almost out of low rank and looking forward to more monsters to fight! (pls let me put endemic life on display in a customizable house again PLEASE!!!)  Capcom, when will you stop adding so many hoops to jump through just to play with people!?"
189375149,english,0,2246340,"I don't think I've had this much fun with a game in a long time. I absolutely love Wilds. It's not perfect, but I love it.   However, it's impossible for me to leave a positive review for this game at its current state. It's probably one of the most unoptimized games in the last 5 years and Cyberpunk came out during this period. This speaks volumes! Capcom needs to pull their sh#t together and fix their game."
188913845,english,1,2246340,"""Monster Hunter Wilds: I'm Ready"" But RE engine is definitely not ready tho. Don't worry, even though it looks bad, at least it runs poorly. Trying to brute force RE engine into open world games clearly just does not work."
188981574,english,0,2246340,"Played the beta, ran like ass. Hoped they'd fix it. Ran the benchmark, good results, thought they'd fixed it. Paid the silly price of games these days... didn't fix it. Such a shame because you can see the gameplay is there, the combat is there, the environment is there... would just be amazing if you could actually play it. I think a privately hired dude showing you each frame on flashcards as fast as he can be arsed to would give you a smoother experience.  Refunded and i'll be back when you make this obviously great game playable."
191400647,english,1,2246340,"[h2]Monster Hunter Wilds[/h2]  I have to say that I personally haven’t had any performance issues with the game. However, I acknowledge that I have a powerful system, and weaker configurations might struggle. Still, I can’t criticize the game for problems that I haven’t experienced myself. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3438993521 Just like with Dragon’s Dogma 2, I’m so happy to see a AAA project that isn’t running on Unreal Engine that I’m willing to forgive some of RE Engine’s quirks, even though it’s clearly not the best for open-world games. It’s a shame that developers like CD Projekt Red decided to abandon their own RED Engine in favor of the more popular Unreal Engine. Cyberpunk 2077 is literally the most beautiful game right now, while Unreal Engine games often look similar to each other. If you play them back to back, it sometimes feels like you’re playing the same game over and over again. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3437765725 As for Monster Hunter, the combat in this game is absolute cinema. There aren’t that many monsters yet, but the developers have clearly focused on quality. The fights feel well-designed and polished. The game itself plays and controls very well. I think they’ll improve performance over the year, and there’s no doubt they’ll deliver more content. Fans have shown massive support by buying a huge number of copies at launch, so Capcom has no excuse not to support the game - unlike Dragon’s Dogma 2 (which, unfortunately, probably won’t be getting any DLC). https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3436312302 The story campaign is fairly short and simple, but it does a good job of introducing newcomers to the game’s overall vibe. However, while they made things easier for newcomers in that regard, the co-op experience (group creation, frequent disconnects, and inconvenient rejoining) could really use some improvements. A more seamless co-op system would be great. Overall, the game is fantastic. The combat is exciting, though maybe a bit easier at launch (some mechanics have been simplified compared to Monster Hunter: World), but it’s still highly addictive!"
191390519,english,1,2246340,"This game feels like a fine dining experience—elegant, delightful, and entertaining, but also pricey and a bit lacking in portion size. Still, with frequent updates and improvements, it could remain fun and engaging for a long time."
189007625,english,0,2246340,This game needed another few months entirely dedicated to optimization and bug fixing. There is so much wrong with the performance of this game.
191069105,english,0,2246340,"[u]This is a review from a veteran who started way back in MH3U and having played every single mainline/portable series ever since.[/u]  This is an unfinished game, unoptimized mess. With the developer intention of going mainstream the game just become way too easy with so much handholding in the early part of the game to the point that the difficulty is almost nonexistence and while still having an unchallenging endgame, being forced to jump through multiple hoops just to play with friends with the bloated co-op menu, monotonous and confusing map design, seriously i cant even memorized most of the map yet after 100 hours in and after already platinum'ed 200 hours later. make no mistake this is a still good game but seriously need more time in the oven for it to be great. in this current state i would say this game is still a ""premium"" beta. if ur new to the series and wants somewhat of a challenge go for World or if you really want a challenging experience go for Rise instead. Wilds is really just walk in the park.  p.s this review will be edited if the game gets better with updates in the future."
188998422,english,0,2246340,"Denuvo locked me out while I was troubleshooting start up crashes. Apparently, it counts every time you switch Proton versions as a separate installation. Thanks, Capcom, for using such an aggressive DRM!"
190336674,english,0,2246340,"The game is WILDly underperforming even on high-end hardware. Frankly, I have little to say that hasn't already been said by others. Performance aside...  1. There's a strange pivot away from the ""hunting"" aesthetic in this title. There's no more tracking, monsters are always seen on the map and you can automatically run to them (without any input, really). I can appreciate QoL that speeds up the game a bit, but these are key aspects that are required for proper gameplay pacing and made other Monster Hunter games feel the way they do. 2. The game is lacking some serious gameplay variety through features like the Private Quarters (from World). Because the pacing of hunts is already cranked to an all-time high, having nothing else to do makes the game turn into this boss rush with no meaningful breaks. To me this made it much easier to burn out on this game than on World. 3. I wouldn't expect an endgame given that there is no Master Rank yet, but I do want to point out that the game's existing endgame doesn't offer all that much. It's an upgrade from base World's endgame grind, but that's not saying much given how tedious World's was.  Overall, while it's a good new entry in the series, its problems currently vastly outweigh its strengths and I would recommend players to wait for updates. A lot could be done to address these concerns and I have high hopes that Capcom will listen to the players post-launch to release some much needed changes.  If you're still interested in playing the game, I'd say only buy the game if you're very certain that you can run it properly. The Benchmark tool, according to many, is not an accurate assessment of final performance, so do take it with a grain of salt.   I will change my review once Capcom has committed to addressing aforementioned issues."
188945286,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. World is one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay in this is good, because it's Monster Hunter.  However, if you aren't already a MH fan - I would stay away:  This game looks and runs like absolute dogshit. Actually, worse. It's pretty impressive that this team was able to take such INCREDIBLE assets like the character models, monster designs, and animations - just to take them all out back, smear them in horseshit and weigh them down with stones until they flatten into a miserable experience that is barely playable. With a 4070 and i7 14700kf 32gb of RAM I NEED to use a third party program (shout out Lossless Scaling) to make the game playable on medium settings. It looks HORRIBLE. The textures are muddied over from the (again, necessary) upscaling and everything turns into a ghosting mess. FPS will swing +/- 40 frames when nothing is happening at all.   Making the deliberate choice to use the RE engine for this after the absolutely abysmal fuckup that was Dragons Dogma 2 is fucking astounding to me. The level of disconnect between people who actually played this thing before launch and the reality in which we all live has reached a point that it should be studied by psychologists and philosophers alike as an example of incredible survival within a complete delusion and degredation of the mind. It's an affront to the effot of everyone who worked on rest of the game.   Don't plan on playing this with friends either, the system for joining and creating parties is, once again, a miserable and complicated experience that's buried within layers upon layers of disconnected menus and constantly changing hotkeys, with three different types of ""party"" for you to be in or out of at any time. If you are looking to pull up a friends list, hit ""invite."" and then start playing? Find a game that respects your time in that regard.  I know they still ""got my money,"" and I'm victim to ""I love thing and want thing so I'll play it anyway."" But companies need to stop releasing games like this. I don't think I'll be on board for another one. If you don't love Monster Hunter enough that you'll deal with hating yourself for this purchase because you just NEED IT - DO NOT BUY"

One small issue I have is the story is very rails - the Seikret and game pretends im in control as we go between points, but I am not at all. Would rather the game didnt lie to me rather than have me diagnostics check whether my controller is responding.

Some fights feel like they end too quickly, and I’d love to have longer, more drawn-out battles to really enjoy the depth of the combat.  But honestly?

188916638,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is the next major instalment in the Monster Hunter series. What Monster Hunter Worlds had, Wilds sadly, just falls short on what World's had. Not completely in a bad way but it is missing the ""good"" stuff about worlds - the end-game. After playing for 30 hours I can now tell you what I think about it!  EDIT: Review is up-to-date as of 18/03/25  Below I will state any issues, my pros and cons but first a quick disclaimer!  [b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b]   [h1][b] Pros[/b][/h1]  ⚫Monster Hunter Rise let you ride around on a palamute, in Monster Hunter Wilds you get to ride around on a Seikret that can GLIDE!?!?!?! I love it!!! ⚫So far, the improvements to weapons are amazing! Got my gunlance ready to be mastered again and now you can carry ANOTHER WEAPON!?!?!?! Now to swap between my bow and Gunlance whenever I want!!! ⚫Cooking has had an overhaul. Now, when you eat food buffs last a set time and they don't go away until the timer runs out, a bonus with this - the timer does not count down when you are in your camp... AMAZING!!! So much smoother now!! ⚫Each area is seamless so far. Full of life and stunning locales. Not only that, each area has weather that changes which adds to land itself. It really makes the land feel alive!! ⚫The monsters look stunning and all of their animations are just... spot on. I cannot tell you how much I love their animations and how amazing they look, especially with the HD texture pack. ⚫You can craft Artisan weapons which are insanely fun to use and to top it off these weapons deal devastating blows to monsters.  [h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1]  ⚫I have seen a lot of people say that the game is ""TO EASY"" - okay, it is much easier. MUCH easier, BUT it's only just out. Give it time. They can always add in Tempered or Arch tempered monsters or heck... a new difficulty bump setting at a later date.  ⚫Charging almost £10 for character edit vouchers is... not right. I am sorry but that's disgusting.  ⚫I have had a few ""performance"" issues here and there. A bit of lag, stutter and occasionally my textures turn to playdough. Another case of ""RELEASE NOW - PATCH LATER"". ⚫The end-game is a disappointment. You are forced to hunt the same 6 monsters over and over again - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna.... making the other 22 monsters completely useless. You will hunt the other 22 about... 1-3 times each and then never have to fight them again. Read about the end-game below!  [h1][b] How the End-Game works [/b][/h1]  So, don't hate me if I got this wrong - You open your map, look for 1 of the 6 TEMPERED monsters you are ONLY allowed to hunt - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna - if one is there, you save it as an investigation and you go do 1 field survey of it, then do the 3 investigations.   If none is there, you go back into your tent, rest (set weather and time to your liking) and then open your map and have a look again. If none is there, repeat. If one is there do the step above.  I am sorry... but this is the worst part of MH: Worlds.   [h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]  Coming from Monster Hunter Worlds and Monster Hunter Rise, Monster Hunter Wilds is definitely a step forward in some aspects but in others... 2 steps backwards, end-game and difficulty being the negatives.  If you are looking for a GOOD end-game, wilds sadly does not offer that, unless you don't mind brainlessly hunting the same 6 monsters for hundreds of hours for that one artisan weapon piece you need.  They have made Monster Hunter Wilds so much more approachable by making it easier for newer players. Do not judge it to harshly just now on that, its only just out, think towards the future for a DLC like Iceborne!!  [h1][b] 7.5/10! Many improvements but a lacklustre end-game makes for a dull experience sadly  [/b][/h1]"

Honestly, I'm think the game ran better on the Steam Deck during the OBT than it did on release day.   I love this franchise, while I would love to give it a better score, I cannot experience the game.   A lack of modern hardware isn't an excuse for leaving a game unoptimized.

189974174,english,0,2246340,"Wait a year for the real version of the game to be released.   Also, Artian weapons are hideous."
189114692,english,0,2246340,"I've never returned a Monster Hunter game, but I'm really considering it for this one. Monster Hunter World is my most played game ever, followed by Monster Hunter Rise. I love these games. Even MHW had teething issues when it first released, and it was eventually improved and I was willing to upgrade my hardware to run it better. Wilds doesn't feel that way because:  1. It just doesn't look good. Textures are muddy and often incredibly pixelated. Hair, clothing, tents, wood structures, you name it, all look like a phoned-in effort at best. Once in a while you see a really nice texture, which only makes the rest look worse.  2. Despite the low quality textures and muddy sheen, performance is miserable. For reference, I'm on a 3080, and no matter what I set my options to, I can't break 60 fps. And once monsters come on screen, or any action happens, it's stutter city.  3. I know Capcom is capable of doing better. MHW and MHR both, IMHO, looked better and performed smoother than this one. It hurts to know they can do so much better, but didn't.  4. Co-op play is only ""sorta"" there. I buy these games to play with friends, and the way co-op works, you can't play through the story with them. You ""kinda"" can, but not really. It became frustrating enough that everyone basically said they'd just play through solo and consider multiplay when they all finish the campaign. Not the worse issue. Just an annoying one.  5. A loss of exploration. They touted that it was a big open world, however it's almost pointless to explore anywhere so far. When playing the story, if you wander too far from where they want you to be, they forcefully rotate your camera back around and tell you, ""no."" They don't tell you where to go, just where not to go. Frustrating.  6. Critics have seemingly ignored all of this. I don't why this bothers me so much. I myself am considering holding onto the game just because I love Monster Hunter so much. But the numerous glowing reviews seem very ""off"" to me for all of the aforementioned reasons.  Your mileage may vary. I wish you luck. If you have beefy hardware with all the framegen necessary to smooth out this mess, then all the power to you. I tried using the ""Lossless Scaling"" app to add framegen to my own setup, and it helped substantially. Though it still stuttered in battles, with the game looking worse than any previous Monster Hunter title I've played."

The problem is it uses the CPU to render graphics instead of, y'know, the Graphics Processing Unit, so people like me who have a pretty good graphics card are punished for having a cheaper CPU to compensate. It seriously sucks that I can't enjoy a game I've been waiting years for just because I don't have the money for an expensive CPU for just this game.

But I cannot, under any circumstances recommend this game to anyone in its current state due to performance and I'm primarily writing this review to add to the discourse in a way that Capcom can respond to and hopefully address.   I am running a 3070ti and Im managing anywhere from 70 - 110 fps on high preset setting with some tweaks, how you might ask? By leaning on AMD's FSR with framegen enabled and dropping my resolution down to 1080p. This works to create a somewhat smooth experience, especially on controller where I feel input lag less, but what it does not create is a beautiful experience. The game is stunning and I say that as someone that thought the game was a washed out mess at first. When they allow it to during different in game 'seasons' colours begin to pop and areas really come to life. Unfortunately due to my settings FSR tends to make textures blurry and muddy, especially at a distance, so until they can fix the absolutely terrible optimisation my game will continue to look like this.  I will update my review if and when fixes come through, the more I look at it, the more I am certain this game was rushed out the door before it was ready. Do not buy this game if you aren't a fan of the series already, wait for the updates and by then there might even be a discount."
189002811,english,1,2246340,"Yes. The game is poorly optimized, who knows why Capcom went with the RE engine making a giant open world game, but it is seriously not that bad if you play on Medium settings.

It runs worse than the betas did, but there's one word that easily explains this.  Denuvo. Denuvo is that word. Why is anyone still using this garbage?  If something changes on this front (I don't expect it will, Capcom is notoriously stubborn on this point) then I may consider changing this review.  Again, I am enjoying the game.

189333958,english,1,2246340,"I have played every monster hunter game since Tri at least twice, and I usually play to complete the HR100 or equivalent boss on every save. I also played the older live service games, Monster hunter frontier and Monster hunter online. Here are my thoughts on wilds (HR70/50 hours in game at time of writing):   Positives-  POOGIE IS BACK  Monster hunter wilds is really fun, and anyone familiar with the series will like it a lot. The gameplay loop hasn't changed, and capcom has implemented a ton of quality of life changes that make it more accessible to people who want to hunt more and grind materials less.  The new monsters are all really cool, along with their weapon and armor designs. Capcom does not miss when it comes to aesthetics in these games.  As a veteran hunter, I was worried the combat in this game would not be as enjoyable as previous titles, and while hunts are the easiest they have ever been, the attacks and animations in this game FEEL SO GOOD you basically don't notice. I have not used seikret or mantels during combat to make it more challenging, and used un-upgraded starting armor through LR6, but throughout the whole story (both low and high rank) I only carted [died] about 3 times, and did not fail a single quest. I was planning on avoiding using focus mode and exploiting wounds as well, but honestly they are so fun and satisfying to use I would sacrifice the difficulty for the satisfaction. Despite the lack of difficulty, the gameplay loop and game feel is worth 70$ to me personally.  The story in this game is... an improvement from previous entries. The characters, cutscenes, and storyline are more involved and compelling than previous installments, but to be honest, I don't think many people are playing monster hunter for a compelling story. unga bunga hammer go bonk, and all that  Overall, the game feel is impeccable, and I will probably end up putting at least a couple hundred hours into it before its G/Master rank expansion releases in a couple years. Capcom has already promised half a dozen or more free title updates over the next year that will include new monsters and loads of event quests and other things to do in the game. For me at least, the $70 is worth it to satiate my addiction to this series.   Negatives-  Performance is really bad. I have a Ryzen 9 5950x and a 3090 and I am playing this game at 4k high, raytracing off and getting 45FPS. This is playable for me because I spent a decade playing on a 3ds outdoors at 20 fps, but understandably many people are not willing to play a 70$ game below 60fps or able to afford a PC capable of more than 30fps.  On top of the low framerates, graphical bugs are not uncommon either. I personally have experienced the ""black triangle"" 3 or 4 times in my 45 hours of gameplay, which causes a flashing black triangle to fill about a quarter of your screen for 20 seconds or so for no apparent reason, which makes the game almost unplayable while its happening. I have also seen the ""PS2 graphics"" bug, where some models appear to have about 100 polygons like OG Final Fantasy 7. For me this happened once after fast travelling and it resolved itself after about 3 seconds. I personally have not experienced any game crashes (I'm on the latest version of Windows 11 with the latest graphics drivers).  In classic capcom fashion, the menus in this game are heinous.  in particular, setting up multiplayer is particularly problematic until you figure out the system, so I will explain what you need to do to get it working the way you expect it too:  Basically, you want to have your friends in a lobby AND a link party at the same time. The lobby is basically how you can see your friends in the overworld, while a link party allows you to go on quests together as a group. you can go on quests together using either one, but for the best experience, you want both. To set it up: 1. you want one person to create a private lobby after selecting their save data on the home screen. 2. after loading in to the game, that player should get the lobby ID by going to the member list screen (start -> tab 4, labelled ""communication"" -> member list). The lobby ID will be displayed on the right. This player should send that lobby ID to everyone they want to play with. 3. The other players should select ""lobby search"" and then ""find a lobby based on ID"". (finding from in game or steam friends lists seems to have a 30% or less success rate, lobby ID works every time in my experience). 4. After loading in to the lobby, one player should go back to the member list mentioned before, and go to the ""lobby"" tab, then select and invite the other players to a link party. 5. The other players then need to accept the link party invite, either by holding the plus button on their controller after they receive the notification, or by going to start -> communication -> invites -> received invites.  From here, players will be able to see eachother in the overworld (because they are in the same lobby) and will automatically be able to join quests the other players post (because of the link party). Keep in mind a private lobby can have 16 players but a link party is only 4, so your lobby can have 4 groups of 4. You can also join quests from outside a link party by talking to Alma, so you can do quests with anyone else in the lobby, its just less convenient. You can have a link party between players in different lobbies and a lobby with no link parties, but you probably want both.  lastly, I personally found the music to be a little underwhelming compared to previous entries.  None of the negatives are severe enough to be a deal breaker to me, especially since most of them will (hopefully) be patched out.  EDIT:  After thinking about it a while last night, I realized that what really sets the old world games (everything before Monster hunter world) apart from the more recent ones is the feeling that you are really in an intense fight with a monster. I cant really put my finger on what makes that difference, but it has something to do with the players ability to move more freely in current games.  Old world games required a lot more intentionality and commitment to attacks because a poorly timed or spaced attack could cost a cart. I feel like I can get through basically any hunt in Wilds by mashing buttons on my controller while wielding a sword and shield, but I do look WAY cooler doing it in wilds than in any other game.  Part of what I enjoy about monster hunter is the community aspect. Joining a random quest to get materials you need and finding people spamming stickers and gestures and having fun in post game is as relevant as the combat itself to me. Those kinds of interactions aren't as accessible in old world games as they used to be (albiet not impossible to find).  I'm playing with 2 different groups of friends so I am having fun helping them progress through the game while using my own time to do fashion hunting and grind materials for melding armor spheres and artian upgrades. Capcom added event quests and more weekly challenges today. Even if I don't enjoy this game the same way I did old world games, I am still having a lot of fun playing it and it still feels like there is enough for me to do (although I wish there was more).  While it doesn't impact my review of this game at all, I would encourage anyone that enjoys wilds as their first monster hunter to play an old world game like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.   Update as of HR100/~60 hours in game: I was at steam review character limit so I put it on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7acuo/"
190034181,english,1,2246340,"After 60 hours, hunting every monster, and hitting HR 75, I think I can say this is a good entry into the Monster Hunter franchise.   The elephant in the room is of course being the performance and technical state of the game. Quite frankly, this launch is unacceptable. There's no reason for my new rig with a 4070ti and a Ryzen 5 7600x should be struggling to hit 60fps at 1080p. It seems like they really want you to use frame generation on your first bootup as a magic bandaid, but that's not how this works. Bad performance is bad performance. This alone would normally get me to give it a negative review.  But dammit, this game is so fun. It's all I've been thinking about lately. In terms of the core gameplay, this is the best monster hunter has ever been. Everything feels good to use, every weapon is fun, every fight is cinematic, and every monster is diverse, and in my opinion, more interesting than the monsters in base world.  That being said, it's not all fantastic. The other elephant in the room is the difficulty of the game, which has been a hot topic, and has been since World even. This was my experience: I played most of the game solo or with a buddy, and I honestly didn't see much issue with the difficulty. I'm not a Monster Hunter expert, but I'm not a beginner either, so I expected low rank to be a pushover and it was, no problem with that. High rank saw a boost in difficulty, primarily with the Apex Predators, that I was happy with. Not too hard (which will come in master rank I'm sure) but not brain dead. I rarely carted throughout the game, but I also played previous Monster Hunters and still had to actually fight. From my memory this is about the experience I had in World as well.   But then I decided to play some 4-player SOS missions, and the dynamic changed entirely. Most monsters rarely attacked since they were constantly getting hammered, wounded, and stunned, including late monsters. World wasn't entirely difficult either, but this slaughter wasn't as common place even with 4 other players. It feels like the game was balanced for solo and duo play and not much else, the monster health is super low and the wound status rate is too high, which just creates scenarios where 4 players wail on the monster creating perpetual wounds. A big appeal of Monster Hunter is the multiplayer, which makes this a bit of a disappointment. Teaming up in Monster Hunter usually always makes it easier, but it really shouldn't be this much of a leap to where hunts end almost as soon as you reach the monster. This WASN'T the case in World, I still felt like 4-player hunts were fun in that game even if it was a tad easier.   In general, multiplayer is the weak point of this. Needlessly complicated to even get into a game, in some cases even a downgrade from prior games in terms of accessibility. I don't see the reason for the distinction between Lobbies, Link Groups, and Environment Links. It just seems overly complicated and poorly explained. And of course, the famous communication error makes a grand return.  Arena missions are missing as well, which is unfortunate. Some of my favorite memories of previous Monster Hunter games were teaming with a friend to get the best time with the pre-selected gear setups, but that aspect of the game is gone. Hopefully it makes a return in a future title update or in the Master Rank expansion. (EDIT: Confirmed for title update 1!!)  And then there's some general gameplay changes, i.e. the Seikret mount, no monster tracking, easy escapes and heals. To be fair, most of these were introduced in Rise and were just brought back to this, but generally I don't think they were needed and likelycontribute to the lack of challenge veterans are experiencing. Hunters and Palicoes have more tools now than ever before, but the monsters haven't been buffed to match (yet) and it's starting to show the divide. Again, low and high rank are all that's available, so I can't say whether this is necessarily good or bad yet, but I can't deny some of the Monster Hunter identity seems to be lost. Tracking and searching may have been shallow, boring, and frustrating in the other entries, but it was a part of the charm of actually hunting the monster. You could argue with that gone you can get right to the good bit, which is the fights, but then it just ends up feeling like a boss rush game and less like a hunt, especially when ""prep-time"" feels like more of an afterthought now more than ever.   That being said, I have still thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game (and not done yet!) and think it's still some of the best gameplay the series has to offer, which at the end of the day is what draws me in. This is the perfect starting point for a new hunter and has a lot to offer. Just keep in mind Monster Hunter is famous for confusing progression and menus, and just have fun with it without getting bogged down too much. Looking forward to crown hunting (yes I'm crazy), updates, and Master Rank!"
189066635,english,1,2246340,"Guys, I like the gameplay and all, but could you add more menus to the game? I feel like there are not enough menus in the game. I would like at least 2x more menus for each interaction. Also, I think 2-3 types of party aren't enough to play with a friend. We need at least 5-6 types. Maybe with 2-3 menus each. Also, could you add 2-3 submenus in the main-menu?"
190904134,english,1,2246340,"To say I've put in quite a few hours over the past few weeks would be an understatement, so obviously I had a good time. If I take away some of my bias, it barely passes the recommended line though, and definitely with some caveats.  [h3]Caveat 1: Optimization[/h3] Let's start with the elephant in the room. The game runs worse than QWOP. You need a top of the line rig and preferably 2 to 3 mods in order to ensure it runs smooth enough on higher graphic settings. If you own a more affordable PC, there are about 10 different optimization guides and a reddit megathreat to help you out with making the game playable.  If that's not your cup of tea, don't buy the game until they fix this premium priced mess.  [h3]Caveat 2: Difficulty[/h3] I started with Monster Hunter Rise, and it was the same story back then. The new mechanic made the game too easy. Now I hear similar arguments about Seikrets making the game too easy.  I think a lot of people understate the fact that escape mechanics are relatively trivial in the long run. When I started in Rise, I needed that escape to succeed quests. As I got more experienced at hunting monsters, it started to feel like an easy escape button. After hundreds of hours the ability became trivial since I had mastered my dodges and evades.  When I started in Wilds, I very rarely used my Seikret escape button. It's because I came in with thousands of hours of experience. Experience that translates to this game, because at its core it's still a Monster Hunter game. As the title updates and eventually master rank will arrive, we will see a bump in difficulty, until we min-maxed those end game builds. Then everyone will be complaining again that it's too easy.  I don't think the same applies to new players though, or the ones that play every now and then. Monster Hunter in general is very overwhelming if it's your first entry into the series, and I believe Wilds strikes a good balance between difficulty, survivability and most importantly...fun. There is very little that stops you from playing the game. There is almost always something you can do through skills, items or abilities.  In other words, if you are a veteran looking for a difficult Monster Hunter game, I can't recommend this one. If you are new to series, and have a NASA PC at home, and are willing to install mods, I can recommend this game.  [h3]Caveat 3: Purpose of Monster Hunter[/h3] I hear a lot of complaints about how the series is turning away from its original purpose. I can't account for that myself because this is my second Monster Hunter game. What I can account for is my own reason for why I boot up the game. It's to hunt monsters. And in my opinion, that's the most important part of a Monster Hunter game.  Hunts may or may not last shorter. Tools may or may not be unlocked quicker. I don't know. What I do know, is that the fights are amazing. In between the 10 million stutters, frame freezes and disconnects of course. Whether that's 4 veterans absolutely destroying a monster, or just you, your weapon and your skills. There is also a good variety of monsters, given that this is only the starting roster.  In order to get to the fun part you do need to put in some hours though. Monster Hunter is notorious for feeling clunky at first. There is a flow which most people only start to appreciate after they have spend a substantial amount of time with the combat mechanics. Once you have found the weapon that fits with your flow, hunts starts to feel like dances with the monsters, and it feels great. That's why I keep playing.  If you're down for that, then I can recommend this game. Again, provided you have a NASA PC at home and a Nexus account for some optimization mods. If you are looking for elaborate preparation rituals and a deep understanding of the game in order to beat monsters, then this is not the game for you.  [h3]Caveat 4: Multiplayer[/h3] If you want to play with friends, there are lobbies, squads, link parties, hunter friends and two different voice chat channels. It's a confusing mess. Once you know where to look it's quite simple of course, but you need a 5 step guide to help you do this for the first time.  If you are more of a solo player, you can't cue up for SOS quests. Instead the game shows you a list of all the SOS quests that are ''available.'' You have to manually click on one, request to join, wait, click away a message that says you can't join the session, click away another message that says you can't join the quest, back out of the quest menu, select another quest from the list, and repeat the process. Just host your own quests, it's much better for your mental health.  [h3]Story and Music[/h3] Lastly I want to touch on 2 more points. The story is alright. It actually ties into the locales you visit and the monsters you hunt. It also has some cool lore bits if you are into that. But it's nothing to write home about. The monster themes on the other hand are absolute bangers.  [h3]In Conclusion[/h3] If you want to have some fun hunting monsters with or without others, then I can recommend this game. It has a good starting roster of monsters and there is more to come. The combat will take some time to get used to, but after that there is a lot of fun to be had if you ask me. Even when you got fights down to a science. Aside from the actual fights, it has little else going for it. Hopefully, for now.  However, the game is optimized so badly that I can only recommend it in good faith if you have a very solid PC. If that's not the case, I would wait until they have rolled out enough patches to at least make the optimization mods obsolete.  [i]Edits: spotted some grammar mistakes.[/i]"
189304061,english,1,2246340,"Incredible Game.

You just get on your mount, and it will carry you to your target automatically.  Another aspects I like in Monster Hunter is how important preparation is, but in Wild, that doesn't realy matter. You forgot to bring a warming potion, oh don't worry, the game has you covered.   I could write a lot of paragraphs complaining about how much easier this game is compared to its predecessor, but maybe people are tired of it.    However after 80 hours. I finally realized that Wild is a better game for me, at least now, since I don't have much time to play games anymore, let alone having to hunt one monster for up to 60 minutes.  I hope that with so many QOL's that make hunting easier, Capcom can balance it by providing new, more challenging monsters."
190363900,english,0,2246340,"This is being written before any of the game's major updates, about three weeks after launch. And it's being written by an insane old lady who started playing this franchise on her Playstation 2 in 2005, who cares about it more than she ought to. I also had a lot of fun in my 50 hours so far. Hitting 'no' on whether I recommend it isn't really a literal 'I do not recommend the game'. It also has nothing to do with the extremely valid criticisms of the game's extremely dogwater performance. Keep all that in mind.  I don't think my take on Wilds is going to be a popular one, even with as many critics as it's building up. Which is fine, I'm used to that, World is the first time I've actually agreed with majority consensus on this franchise, while before that I would have still insisted Unite was the best in the series. That isn't a popular take. But I really can't help but feel like Wilds has gone in a bad direction for the long-term health of the series. Not because of the shorter hunts or the 'lack of content' that you may have already heard complaints about, especially that latter one. I DO think there's some truth to it, I think even at launch World had a lot more to do, but zero question that perception is mostly from people remembering World in its final state.  My issue is that this game feels completely frictionless. The game doesn't feel like it ever stops me, it doesn't feel like it ever trips me up. Everything is so easy to do, not just the fights but supplies and food and inventories and unlocks and layered gear and, just everything. Your mount automatically sends you to where you need to go and everything you'd ever need is put in your pocket then the big monster dies after tapping you on the wrist a couple times and that's that. Even that example I gave before, there's just as many palico gadgets and we obviously still have a mount, but you just kinda. Get them. I didn't have to explore some weirdo unmarked nook of the map to do a weirdo unmarked quest for some random unmarked cats, I just kinda got it. Everything is laid out for you, handed to you.  There's good and bad to the friction being gone. I love that sharpening is actually possible to do mid-fight solo now, but I feel like it's too generous that my seikret can just pick me up to bail me out of anything at all ever. I'm not going to miss Nergigante's 'roar which stuns you for long enough that you don't have time to sheathe your weapon to superman dive away from his now undodgeable attack' garbage, but I'm not sure I like that trade if it means NOTHING feels threatening. Nobody liked the old deco drop rates but... I dunno, it feels a little hollow finishing my build 50 hours into the game. Half of this stuff wouldn't be bad on its own, and half of it is actively good, but all at once? Remove ALL the friction, good and bad, at once? It makes it feel aimless, insubstantial, braindead. The game is so devoid of ANY sort of friction that I'm sitting over here feeling nostalgic about paintballs and mid-fight combining, for gods sake. Those were NOT good mechanics, but in a room full of padded walls I'm craving something concrete, something with some weight to it.  I think my biggest gripe - and I KNOW this take is going to be super unpopular - is focus mode. I just don't think I should be able to throw out attacks nonstop without thinking about them and relying on focus mode's 180s to trivialize positioning. To me, the essence of monhun is the need for commitment, for planning, the fact that having to consider so many things regarding monsters and your own movement and positioning in advance not only necessitated deeply learning monsters' behaviours, but rewarded you massively for it. Landing a TCS on a mobile monster used to be a thing of mastery and beauty and now it's just... Nothing.  The game honestly kinda feels more adjacent to Helldivers than World. A party game that exists purely for small groups of friends to roll loot slot machines in. And don't get me wrong, I like those kind of games, but that's not what monhun was to me.  Regardless of whether future monsters do more damage and take longer to kill, that won't change the fact that focus mode makes positioning nearly redundant, that every single weapon has get-out-of-jail-free moves, that the big moves just aren't hard to pull off anymore given they're either twice as fast or have super armour or both and even if you do screw it up completely you can roll out of it before it's even gone off, that your seikret ensures it's nearly impossible to get combo'd out, that the absolute worst the game can do is put up a Quest Failed screen and take away the 5 mega potions you used on the fight from your stash of 800.  I said at the start of this that I don't necessarily not recommend the game. But, at present, I would definitely recommend you to play World first. Too many edges got sanded down, I think. It's lacking the franchise's usual weirdness, and its abrasiveness. You can give the upcoming update monsters 10 times more HP, but it won't bring back the feeling of satisfaction that overcoming those rough edges brought.  In retrospect Monster Hunter Wilds is a very ironic name for something that feels so completely toothless.  EDIT: I did not expect so much attention on this, let alone for it to all be positive. Thanks for that! Especially the people sharing their old hunting stories, so, lemme share one of my own nostalgic hunting stories as thanks.  I still hadn't 'got' monhun when Unite came out, despite playing 1, 2 and F2. Nargacuga was the flagship monster for that game and I really liked (and still like) its design. I got the quest to hunt it, suited up with my trusty old Akantor armour, and decided on dual blades for it. One of my weaker weapons but it felt appropriate. And, like, what's the worst that could happen? I wasn't even in G Rank yet.  I drastically underestimated how tough a fight it would be, and wasn't nearly good enough with DB for it. I carted twice quickly just from being blindsided. I played safer from then but was still getting knocked around.  I went through my entire potion supply. I kept fighting but got low on HP and ran off to actually use the tent to heal (a lot of people didn't even know you could do that in the older games lmao), and do some old fashioned on-field procurement of potion materials, despite being unfamiliar with the new map. I hadn't had to do that since monhun 1. I thought about going home for the hammer but despite the struggle I was just... having fun. It really did feel like I'd just met something that was my match and I had to knuckle down and learn it.  I somehow managed to keep surviving, but the timer was becoming an issue. I'd barely even remembered quests had a time limit. I basically had no hopes for finishing it off, I was just keeping up the fight as practice. But I kept swinging when I could. Past 45 minutes I stopped going off to gather even when I fell into fatal range. And with literally less than a minute on the clock, it died. Out of almost all my supplies, battered and broken, hanging onto my last life by a thread, but I managed it.  It's still my favourite monster hunter memory. As Wilds is, it's really hard to imagine it making a story, and a feeling, like this. World gave me some similar ones with some of the nastier monsters. Most of those memories were from Iceborne, though, so I do still think there's hope for Wilds to turn out some great moments with AT patches or the inevitable expansion, but like I say in the review, patches can up the numbers but they can't make Helmsplitter satisfying again.  But also like I said in the review, I didn't really like the games between Unite and World much. It's not the end of the world if Wilds still winds up mid after everything. I waited 9 years between monhuns I actually liked before and I can do it again.  Happy hunting, y'all."
191600679,english,0,2246340,"Optimized mess. Modern games need to stop using new PC parts as an excuse, there are games that look 5x as better as this that released years ago and run on older computers completely fine."
191935978,english,0,2246340,"Too hard. Too many Apex monsters use a new attack called ""GENERATE CRASH REPORT"" that can't be dodged and can't be blocked. And ends hunt, bypassing all carts.  Would be a great game once this attack is nerfed."
189006148,english,0,2246340,"Ignoring the glaring performance and networking issues, I don't understand how you managed to make the multiplayer so bad after publishing Rise.   When the multiplayer works, it has the same problems as World, like needing to start quests solo, find the objective, watch a cutscene, exit the quest, and join a friend to actually play the game together.  Why? You already had a good system in Rise. If you're going to do sequences and cutscenes, let me at least bring a friend along.  Also, link groups are a stupid mechanic. Why is progression not tied to the lobby?   For the brief minutes where I do manage to fight the monster with friends, it's a really fun experience. This game may very well have the best combat in the series. I genuinely don't know why you designed the multiplayer this way.  Edit: A lot of you mentioned playing from a squad lobby, and it did make joining after the cutscene much more bearable, but I still don't like the game's singleplayer oriented design for the story quests, especially when Rise and GU story quests both work flawlessly with multiplayer. (Haven't played the older games yet)  Happy to report that non-story missions work with multiplayer almost flawlessly in Wilds. I'm hoping once my group reaches high-rank things will open up a bit more."
192286286,english,1,2246340,"Disclaimer: I played a ton of Monster Hunter so my thoughts come from that position. I'm not a 'purist' who outright dismisses modern MonHun, there's design decisions I have problems with but my focus is mostly on the product. I'm mostly comparing Wilds to World considering these are ""A team"" games (stuff like rise/sunbreak is the B team).  4 key points: Content, Performance, Story, Gameplay.  Content Is always iffy on new Monster Hunter releases. The games are being treated like Pokemon, with an eventual big update dlc/expansion basically making the game feel complete. This is one of the more unfinished feeling experiences I've had with Monster Hunter. I don't say this just from the wealth of Monsters to fight, Tri probably had less, but there's a lot of gaps particularily in the endgame. The fact that the open beta had you fight the de-facto final boss of the game is mad to me. I genuinely had my final boss fight before the game released, it was way harder too which was super satisfying once I beat it. The game is also pushing stuff that feels like it should be basegame into content updates. The first big content update is huge but it also definitely should have been there in the first place.   Performance sucks. The game took 0 lessons from World (And the A team worked on this prior). There's just no two ways about it. You can watch someones youtube footage on a 5090 and they still get texture pop-in. World had massive performance issues at launch and the ones here feel especially eggregious considering World probably is a better looking game too. Try the benchmark.  Story I'm only mentioning because of how forced it is. They definitely wanted to focus on it more this time around but the problem is that it's just not good. It's painfully formulaic and the twist in the middle actually made me laugh out loud with how silly it is. My multiplayer experience with friends was hampered multiple times by one of us having to go through a forced walk-and-talk that you cannot skip. I don't think a strong story would not work in a monster hunter, quite the opposite, but it's definitely not exploring anything interesting with the setting.  Your character this time is fully voiced and also a total badass during cutscenes right from the get-go. Very hard to immerse yourself that way. I cannot understate how egregious it is that your character is being treated like a newgame+++ gigachad from minute 1. Usually monster hunter treats your guy fresh meat straight outta the academy, and you earn your badass status by working your way through challenges. Nata (the kid) gets introduced as the surrogate protagonist because you need a character who is even remotely vulnerable to have some stakes. The confrontation with the final boss may as well have had linkin park playing with how badass/edgy the setup was.  Gameplay. Lotta things I could talk about here. There's plenty of smaller nitpicks between a really awkward multiplayer lobby system and questionable weapon balance, but if I had to summarize the biggest issue with Wilds it would be something like this: This is the Monster Hunter game where they want you to feel like a badass. Hunter movesets are far too powerful, Monsters did not compensate enough for this. You are consistently overpowering monsters at every stage of the game. As others have pointed out before, the game feels like you are beating low-rank monsters with high-rank gear. Hunter movesets were made to be a lot more mobile which is definitely fun, but it also means that positioning matters less. Why reposition for a big attack when you can just press the parry/counter that is completely reaction based, on a very very easy reaction no less. Parries definitely do not come at a premium in this one. A lot of talk was made about how the Seikret was an improvement over the wirebug from rise, but I think people underestimate how powerful the Seikret is. The game doesn't outright say this but you can get knocked down and still call your bird, completely saving you with plenty of invulnerability, making it functionally impossible to die given how calling it is free. This is by far the easiest monster hunter.  My guess is this is also why the Story treats you like a badass from the get-go. I think this is a deliberate decision by the devs. This is the game about the power fantasy of being a monster hunter, but it feels unearned if the challenges aren't really there (or your character does something badass in a cutscene).  The content and difficulty in this game are intertwined. The grind in Monster Hunter primarily functions as the endgame and replayability, giving you goals to do micro-optimizations to your gear, try different weapon loadouts, etc. Problem is they hand you everything way too quickly. An armorset can be completed in 2 hunts. Jewels you basically get shoved down your throat (and I didn't even do the farming exploit that was meta for a while). And why grind anyway if I'm already demolishing monsters. I don't really feel the improvements to my gear when fights are easy and they are still easy with better gear. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of the series, I'm not expecting to get challenged the same way here as I am with late-stage content of older games. But this is the only monster hunter where I just feel ""done"" with the game. I've seen it all.  The future for this game is a little iffy. They clearly shipped the game too early and are introducing more stuff with their scheduled content updates. I'm not certain they will fix core issues with the game however. They talk about looking into balancing and I certainly hope their 'careful language' there will bring the overall powerlevel of hunters down, but I doubt it.  I'm probably coming back to it once the big ""rise2"" expansion releases, but until then, as I said, I've seen it all. I would still recommend this game as an entrypoint for newcomers if you have the PC hardware to properly run it. It's still monster hunter. It's still fun with friends and all. But after finishing wilds we went back to revisit sunbreak and had a much better time overall."

Capcom you really showed those dirty repackers and pirates a lesson by locking me out of the game I paid you close to one hundred American dollars for. You really saved me there--I don't know what i would do if were able to play with my friends for the one game we have all been excited about for half a year. You know what? You're right I don't need friends anyway. Hopefully they will all get locked out too.

189044441,english,0,2246340,"[h1][b]Here's the most relevant reasons the game feels so bad until high-rank:[/b][/h1]  [b]1. Performance, and fidelity.[/b] Reasonable framerates on everything but the latest GPUs come at the cost of textures that look straight out of a ps2 game half the time. Why do my scoutflies look like minecraft particle effects when I'm not 2 inches from them? Why does having more than 2 entities on screen, or rotating my camera at all, cause stuttering? The difference in quality between this and other recent AAA titles is staggering. Wilds has such good designs and animations, which get severely neutered by the absolutely broken performance.  [b]2. Multiplayer cohesion.[/b] It is miserable to have to re-join a quest, only after someone has actively started the hunting portion of the quest, when you have played along the exact same questline. Not only that, even if you're playing in tandem, you have to ACTIVELY run away from the hunt you're trying to complete together in order to even re-join your friends, since the game gives you a connection error if you get hit by the monster you were immediately forced to fight. It's crazy that they managed to un-fix a problem I thought they'd resolved in other titles.  [b]3. Pacing.[/b] Good lord, it's miserable. Are you going to get a cutscene that forces you to leave the area immediately after a quest? Or maybe a dialogue sequence you have to skip through one message at a time? Or an unskippable auto-walk at the slowest possible movement rate on your seikret? After 2-4 of these, randomly chosen, you will be immediately thrust into a hunt that lasts all of 5 minutes. Repeat until the credits roll.  [b]4.  Difficulty.[/b] Worlds and Rise both had significantly harder monsters than anything in Wilds. They have tiny health pools that make it so you barely engage a monster before it's dead. Their attacks do negligable damage that is healed with 1 potion (or better yet by your palico which you no longer have any choices to make regarding their tools), and there's no threatening follow-ups to the monster attacks on the off-chance they even get you low enough to care. Wounds spawn constantly, and borderline stunlock monsters when you proc them. I never, ever felt anything that could qualify as a challenge, not even on the final boss, and so I felt like I had to rush the game to even have a chance at enjoying any gameplay, because HOPEFULLY high-rank is a little less trivial.  [b]5. Exploration.[/b] There is literally no reason to do any exploring, at all, ever. The closest you could get to an incentive would be for pop-up camp locations. Your seikret transports you to all but two destinations automatically, and the entire map and all of it's resources are revealed. There's no gameplay-driven reason to hunt for anything, and it is so sad because the artists put tremendous work into the scope and detail of the world, and the monsters, and the environments, and it all gets wasted because you're never made to gather monster tracks, or do an expedition, or hunt for gathering spots.  When you combine all of these factors, you get a game that feels like it's trying to say [b]""Hey, actually, please don't engage with me until the postgame, because every single system I'm built on is working together to make the process of getting there nothing but a chore.""[/b] It's insane how many systems they discarded that validated the entire experience of Monster Hunter. God, I hope high-rank has some challenge to it at least. It's unforgiveable how badly they designed this game in totality. Bless the artists, and the combat designers, but every director in charge of the rest of the game should be ashamed of the experience they've provided us."

It was fine in the 1st beta, but since the 2nd beta it has been causing crashes, freezes and insane FPS drops for me. - Without the frame generation, the game runs quite poorly on RTX 4070Ti. The optimization is absolutely horrible. - Enabling highest resolution textures causes constant pop-in, despite GPU having more than enough memory to store textures. What's the point in offering ab optional high-quality texture pack as a DLC if texture streaming is so broken?   I'm sorry, but I am done giving publishers a pass simply because I like their games.

189462918,english,1,2246340,"[h1]Preface[/h1] Ever since our beloved series reached the eyes and ears of rest of the world, Capcom has made a valiant effort to keep Monster Hunter titles in check with various innovations to keep the series fresh and appealing to a wider audience. Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.  In this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I'm not even looking at you this time, Rise. You're third place no matter what.  [h1]Positives[/h1] [b]Core Gameplay[/b] The core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I've been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it's all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we're all here for it.  [b]Multiplayer & Questing[/b] The lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn't hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I've seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don't see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to ""load in"" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of ""not taking us out of the immersion.""  [b]The Monsters[/b] The bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren't as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don't seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an ""identity"" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.  [h1]Negatives[/h1] [b]Repetitive Flow - For the first time ever[/b] Although the weapons feature numerous ""gimmicks"" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don't get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what's with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...  [b]Items and Builds - Unnecessary?[/b] I have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I'm almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don't really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.  [b]Lack of Central Hub[/b] The number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!  [b]Bland Story[/b] If I don't mention this category, I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with ""Acknowledged"" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] [b]Final Verdict: 8/10 B[/b] Although the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn't a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state. As I mentioned in the preface, Wilds is more of the same in this humble veteran's eyes, and you can sit comfortably in front of your screen and take heart in knowing that even if you don't buy it now, the game isn't going anywhere. The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the ""gotta play the new game"" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven't tried it yet.  Better yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal. One final note in that regard: aside from the achievement that requires online hunting, I still prefer to solo everything without any issue just because I want get those focus attacks in without interruption. Who knows? You might feel the same way, fellow hunter."
189435988,english,0,2246340,"Extremely fun gameplay but cant recommend in its current state.  Exploding polygons/vertices, horrible texture pop-ins, network errors galore.

For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. The game does not look nearly good enough to warrant this performance. Everything is covered in a grimy texture with assets that look like you straight took them out of a PS3 game. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this. Embarrassing. Wait for a sale and/or optimization updates. I've played games on my Deck that look better than this. When I was kid I couldn't believe how good MHFU looked on my PSP, an entire world in my hands. And now they release a game like this. It saddens me the mediocrity that Capcom has fallen into. But what do I know, maybe I'm just a little silly billy and my 4070 toaster is just outdated at this point. Guess I'll go back to playing better looking games on ultra."
189138464,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. I have 3000+ hours across the recent titles. I played World/Iceborne on Playstation and then PC over again when the PC versions launched. I did the same for Rise/Sunbreak.  I want to preface that I've finished the main story & beaten every monster the game has to offer.   This game, wholeheartedly, is a downgrade in almost every aspect when compared to the previous titles. It's ""OK"" - but there's a lot of things that are just... bad decisions. They'll sell ""fixes"" through an expansion, like they did with Rise, but it's still NOT GOOD in the current state.  We lost SO many quality of life changes. ---------------------------------   Graphical downgrade and terrible optimization. The game looks brown. Everything looks brown. There's filters/settings enabled that just makes it look *bad* - Sometimes, like in the lush forest, it looks incredible when the fog is off... but everywhere else it looks washed out. The FPS is awful (There's a typo in the config file you can fix to add a little more) and you will struggle to get over 60 FPS on average/decent computers.  No idea what happened in testing.  ---------------------------------  Multiplayer is terribly implemented. There's lobbies, link parties, environment links, and a billion other things you need to juggle just to play with people. We seriously went from >make lobby >join lobby >post quests and play... to whatever this is. Even if you're IN THE ENVIRONMENT LINK WITH FRIENDS you still get disconnected sometimes after defeating a single monster. It makes no sense.   You're forced into 'cutscene gates' where you can't do things with people until you see certain things.. something that was FIXED in World because it was SO HATED AND ANNOYING. It's back! Playing with friends is ROUGH until you're at the end of the game.  ---------------------------------  The game is incredibly theme-parky and ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES exploration. You are tethered to certain areas while doing any story mode missions. World encouraged vertical exploration and players to go around on their own, but on here everything is listed, shown, and auto-pathed to by your mount.   There is no central hub, so it feels like you're constantly jumping around ""exhibits"" to find NPC's, quests, turn things in, and do whatever. It's very broken up, sparse, and feels incredibly clunky and jarring to navigate compared to the previous two titles (and even older ones). I guess they're adding a central hub eventually but didn't have enough time? Sucks.  It feels like they took Frontiers and mutilated it, trying to have an ""MMO FEEL"" without any MMO mechanics. I cannot tell you the number of times I've had to look everywhere to find where to turn in quests.   Even things like MAP MARKERS for camps are buried by other markers IN CAMPS and they're really difficult to see/fast travel to. The way the list of camps were shown in World made it *brain dead easy* to find... How did we go to this?  ---------------------------------  The story is very bland. I'd even say that it's awful. I won't go into spoilers or specifics, but there's absolutely no ""big catastrophe"" you're trying to avert or anything major that's being built up to.   Most of the dialogue is patronizing, condescending, or very ""life is special"" - and it just rings really hokey. There's also not even a dragonator anywhere in the entire game. I'd put it on the same level as ""base"" Rise's story, which says a lot.  There's very few memorable characters, moments, or anything along those lines. Part of what makes some of the story of the previous titles so good is how extra and over the top some of the characters are. Again, no dragonator moments.  It can also be completed in less than 10 hours without rushing. It just kinda.. ends.  ---------------------------------  The experience feels soulless. I dunno how else to put it other than feeling like nothing is inspired, and more like everything was ""lets do this again"" in Wilds. It feels like there was no vision beyond ""Make another World game"" and Capcom executives yelling at the developers to do so. The phrase I've heard a LOT of friends using (who are veterans of MH far longer than I am, since the original) is that it feels *incredibly* corporate.  You kinda just get it as a vibe. As you play through, the longer you play through, you'll understand what I mean.  ---------------------------------  Monster variety is very limited, and there's nothing really ""stand out"". Even the flagship monster is uninspired compared to previous title flagship monsters. Going through the entire game, killing every single monster available, I cannot think of a single one that impressed me or made me go ""woah"" on the same level of things like Vaal Hazak, Velkhana, Malzeno, Xeno'Jiiva, etc had to offer. It feels like you're fighting three archetypes the entire game.  A lot of monsters are repeats from previous games, including the movesets and skeletons (which have been used on a few of the new ones), which is a bit disappointing considering how few actually exist.  I'm actually worried about future content because most of the announced monsters are just filler/mid tier monsters... and the game's already done. The escalation wont be there unless they add things like Alatreon, etc, alongside smaller threats.  ---------------------------------  There's no endgame. You farm two or three tempered monsters at the end and that's it. There's no carrot on a stick to pursue and you'll be done as a dedicated player within a few days.  I won't go into extreme detail but yeah, nada.  ---------------------------------  Decorations are really weird now. Most attack based ones can only be put on weapons (Such as ballistics, etc), which means only 3 slot weapons can fit them. Three slot slots on armor/etc CANNOT wear the same decorations as weapons. This severely limits builds. Most armor sets also are just *incredibly* lackluster when it comes to skills provided.  I get this limits player power but.. it just feels really clunky on how they did it.  ---------------------------------  The entire new wound system is just clutch claw from Iceborne but way more auto-pilot. You do huge amounts of damage while wounding, get free materials, and CONSTANTLY KNOCK DOWN MONSTERS from applying wounds. There's fights you're going to do later once you're geared where monsters cannot get up off of the ground.   People complained about the clutch-claw gameplay and this is just the exact thing.. but WAY more  overtuned and broken. Even the hardest monsters the game has to offer kinda get destroyed by any sort of wound mechanic.  ---------------------------------  The food system is a downgrade. I get what they were going for but in simplifying it they've made it kinda awful. Getting materials sucks, the stores that sell/offer ingredients only seem to give you rations, and the bonuses from food are lackluster. We went from having major defense up, attack up, ammo conservation, and all these other awesome things to just basic buffs.   NOT TO MENTION THERE'S NO PALICO CUTSCENES FOR FOOD COOKING. RIP Grandma food cat.  ---------------------------------  The camera is awful. Monsters are bigger than your screen and tracking is bad. Can't count the number of times later that bigger monsters are just 95% of your screen and you can't see what they're doing fast enough. Even at max zoom/focus it's a downgrade from World.  ---------------------------------  I *want* this game to be better than it is and I know they'll make it better in the future, but man, I wouldn't be surprised if I see lots of people going back to play World/Iceborne after a couple of weeks of Wilds.  Monster Hunter fans will still find enjoyment in the game but the entire way through you'll probably be thinking ""I miss this"" or ""This is clunky"" or ""This was done better"" - and that's just sad to me."
190077988,english,0,2246340,"After two weeks since the game's release, I am still unable to play it at all. As far as I can tell, no patch has been released to fix these issues.

191081501,english,0,2246340,"For a €70 game in 2025, the optimization is seriously disappointing. Performance issues make it hard to enjoy, and for the price, that’s just not acceptable. I wouldn’t recommend this game."
189044542,english,0,2246340,"The game is really good, but the performance is horrible for most people; a lot of it can be traced to bad I/O and streaming. Some of it can be attributed to the overly active anti-tamper; there's more FPS correlation when installing the game on a fast NVMe SSD than having a 500 vs 1000 dollar GPU, which is ridiculous.  The game runs well on my machine but that's no excuse for how badly it runs on most machines, especially when this is a game that you play with friends. Avoid buying until you hear that Capcom has made the game actually run well on your machine; make sure to check with the benchmark before you buy. I won't be surprised if/when a crack comes out and the game runs way better with it."

189397727,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter is my childhood series of nearly 16 years,  [h1]Optimisations are not the sole issue.[/h1]  Performance [i]has been[/i] unnecessarily poor for many people. However, [b]fixing this will not solve the game's frustrating nature.[/b]  [h3]Visual design is great. Combat has been truly impeccable. However, every other sect of direction has lain the devil in the details, creating a grossly obstructive and discouraging experience while taking multiple steps back from the whole series. It's clear the game is unfinished.[/h3]  As a whole package, when only one of the main components established over 20+ years is done well and worthwhile side content is summed up by 'the fishing's kinda cool now', there is a huge problem.  So TL;DR: Roundabout and cluttered UI, [b]a gutting of series mechanics without fun, appropriate replacements[/b] and a story whose beats are brief and forgettable on purpose, yet is frustratingly paced, stretched and ground down rails like something worth telling - handholding far exceeding time actually spent hunting. Insult to injury comes from ignoring Rise for an obtuse multiplayer worse than World's painful 'leave and restart the quest to let friends join' system.   All to imprison you in a title whose major innovation is finally being open world for 'player freedom'.  [h2]So how does this begin to come together?[/h2]  On UI:  Try adding a friend you already know through this game without joining the same lobby. There's no dedicated ""Friends"" menu. You will probably take 10 minutes. Wanna play together? Go to the same lobby. Now you need a link party. Now you need to...  It is [i]all[/i] a sub menu jungle: poorly planned, explained and labelled.  More importantly, there's a HUD ripped from a 'corporate open world slop' mockup you'd find around Elden Ring's release. Most of it can be customised, but there's a beady, omnipresent and unremovable objective marker, duplicated on the un-customisable minimap telling you where everything is through visual barf; it all blends together.  [h3]These features are notorious for stealing your attention from a game. Perhaps forgivable elsewhere, but 2 of Monster Hunter's core components are attacked by this. One by being cheaply replaced. It actually [b]strips the series' special identity.[/b] [/h3]  [h2]What are they and why are they important then?[/h2]  1) [b]Preparation.[/b] Straight forward step. Pick out your items and equipment. Eat. Head out. It's a light strategic phase relying on memory and your personal preference. Without it you make life 10x harder.  2) [b]Scouting and foraging.[/b] Huge part of what makes MH special. Exploration and becoming familiar with a location, its details and secrets were given similar importance to learning the behaviors and patterns of the monster you hunted because of how they - and you - are intertwined. Your understanding is personal and ropes you into feeling part of the world. Since environmental hazards came out, this saw explicit gameplay reward too.  3) [b]Tracking.[/b] Before World it was your way to secure your combat reward for good scouting, with light management because paintballs wore off. World made it an additional reason to engage with the environment; how well it was done is up to interpretation.  4) [b]Combat and chase.[/b] Self explanatory. The meat of the game and main reward for locating the target monster.  You may notice these are simplified steps to actual hunting.   [h3]So which of these are attacked exactly?[/h3]  [b]Scouting:[/b] Immediately knowing where everything is defeats the need and incentive to explore. How the hell are we expected to care for cool spots we never discovered ourselves? Stray too far and the game yanks you away for daring to look at something new. Somehow they removed joy and wonder from higher tier environment design. At least they let us physically ignore 90% of the world by holding a button to laser focus on text in the most braindead iteration of gathering to ever grace us.  [b]Tracking:[/b] This is what's removed outright, replaced by the tacky magic objective marker. Tracks still exist but only give you currency. Scout flies became useless by World's endgame so that's why? [b]Well there's a clear rework they could've done:[/b]  Believe it or not sneak attacks and bushes exist as afterthoughts to some basic stealth system. If they wanted to remove tracking, [b]why wasn't the level design built with engaging stalking in mind, where some monsters only stayed to fight or could lose their special power if we snuck up on them first?[/b] What if our ""intelligent"" seikret could be taught to help with this? Why didn't they replace scoutflies with the raptor following scents?   Wanted to keep the flies and tracking anyway? Have them trained to only follow monsters tagged by paint for the whole hunt. Ruin hiding tactics or some amazing camouflage that's hard to see with the naked eye. It's reason to care about rain too.  Right now, only having prep for battle sounds like a glorified boxing ring. [b]""Monster Brawler"" is not the name of the series.[/b]  [h3]Anything else of value?[/h3]  Each of these are so far absent:  -Home customisation -Endemic life as pets -Mounts engaging in combat -Collectables -Raids  Cooking skill variety is pretty sad compared to every other game too.  MH games always offered 'extra'. (Raids would need improving)  [h2]But the combat's still good, right? How does this affect me?[/h2]  [h3]Lazy choices disrespecting core identity lead to lazy choices disrespecting you and this is present throughout. Not just in boring navigation, backwards menus or some nightmare 4-5 steps with recursive loop to playing multiplayer with friends. So how does combat fare...?[/h3]  [h1]Low Rank is Hell.[/h1]  The mind-numbing kind.  1) [b]A top complaint is hunts being too short.[/b] The devs failed to develop a new, fun, gameplay buildup to engage with before fighting, nor have they balanced the combat to really let you partake in this part's stellar system. 5-10 minutes when hours deep is immensely dissatisfying. It's a potato chip experience: tastes great but is gone too soon. Rise and World got it just right.  2) [b]Build crafting.[/b] Decorations are segregated on whether they're a 'weapon gem' or 'armor gem', removing creative slot management and the satisfaction of optimal builds how [i]you[/i] wanted. Very old games would add to one skill and take from another. Balancing that prevented OP builds better than this restrictive, over-corrective mess.  3) [b]Then there's the story.[/b] World let you breathe - Wilds crushes your windpipe. Progression for ~75% of your first 8-16Hrs is stuck in the most shallow, uninspired nothingburger drivel, forcibly handholding you throughout it all. Some interesting lore and that's it. Frequent are shacklings to tiny spaces just in case you wanted to - God forbid - play the game. Combine how [i]short[/i] the hunts are and the bore drills deep.  [h2]So what's the recurring problem here?[/h2]  [h3]Everything is designed to stop you engaging with the game, both implicitly and explicitly. Going so far as to hollow the experience out and prescribe you a narrow vision on how to interact until finally opening up by endgame. Dozens of hours in.[/h3]  Unlike any other MonHun, you can't really look, learn or enjoy outside combat. Minimal side content. Constant nags on where to go, where to stand, who to speak to and when play's allowed between each. And every. Quest... Sounds like a school - that fun to you?  And it's tragic because there are cool, fun little details with beauty to witness. Again, combat is fantastic. But for all these efforts to make the game worth playing, someone in Capcom's out of touch management either refused to let the game cook or stirred the pot, thinking MH as 'just another action game' when the legs are built on so much more. Now sloppy and missing features encroach on what gives it character.  World:Iceborne remains king. Sunbreak is queen."

Send all the clown awards you want but that wont fix the shitty unoptimised game.

188939251,english,0,2246340,"AMD BEWARE  I generally dislike leaving negative reviews when a game just released because I'm afraid it'll seem like jumping on the ""hate the popular thing"" bandwagon etc. However. The perfomances are one thing I can ignore, it doesn't run good but it runs well enough on my machine, I can wait for updates for that  What I cannot ignore however is the inability of the game working on top of the line AMD GPUs, I have a 7900XT and the game crashed on startup, until I figured I had to turn on WINDOWS 7/8 COMPATIBILITY MODE IN THE EXECUTABLE PRORIETIES   And that's where the huge problem lies, if you turn on Comp mode, half of the textures shit themselves, I'm not talking about a lttle artifact here and there, I'm talking about a MASSIVE artifact covering the ENTIRE screen as soon as there's a rock in frame, this is unnacceptable especially for the flagship product of a company  And you cannot turn it off once you booted, you'd think maybe the issue was shaders compiling, or something But no. Turning off comp mode brings the game back to crash on startup  I still put up with it considering it's either that or no monstie at all, but the review is a solid negative and will stay as is until the problem get hotfixed.  AMD BEWARE unless you're ready to have your eyes bleed. For now at least.  Those armour sets are banging though."
189223176,english,0,2246340,"This might get drowned out by all the reviews about performance, but there are many issues I had with the game past that.  Difficulty: I used pc controls and the lance for the first time for my playthrough and didn't even need to craft armor until Guardian Doshagama, going from 11 defense to 131. From there it was a cake walk just by using what random materials I had from doing quests, even beating a tempered Arkveld right after beating the main story with no problem still using random bs. I understand wanting to make a game accessible to all skill levels, but doing it to this degree gives most players no reason to interact with the open world at all during the story, and considering the lack of postgame, basically invalidates the open world as a whole.  Weapon and combat changes: Counter reliance is bad for monster hunter, and every weapon has some form of counter in this game, with certain weapons revolving around spamming counters now. Plus, certain overtuned attacks have made some weapons lose nuance in gameplay, and in conjunction with wound attacks, makes the combat feel really spammy. Also, the combination of wounds, clashes, and offsets really thrashes the monsters around, making even returning threats feel more pathetic than ever. The majority of combat changes seem to prioritize making the game more cinematic and satisfying over giving it mechanical depth, which I can enjoy for one game, but I hope that design philosophy is a one time thing. [Additional minor nitpick: what kind of logic makes wounds go away when you hit them, and makes it so you can only do certain combos if you start them by hitting a wound?]  Content and pacing: I beat every main quest, side quest, and monster available at launch in 27~ hours of gameplay, and I wasn’t really in much of a rush. What’s arguably worse is that you pretty much fight the final boss in low rank, and the entirety of high rank feels like postgame, with its final fight being a rematch from low rank. Then, there is basically no actual post game other than fighting a handful of tempered monsters harder than what you get from doing the main high rank quests.  Monsters: The new monsters are fine. Since it's a subjective topic, all I care to mention is that the movesets of some seem shallow, and many of their moves plus the new moves given to old monsters seem poor at indicating the direction and space they’re gonna take up. I also think they lack the charm found in many classic monster hunter monsters, but that can be applied to monsters from rise and world as well.  The environment: It's decent, which is devastating in comparison to how amazing the locales were in world. Not including graphical issues, it can be ugly and dark and boring at times, but can certainly be beautiful, especially in the ruins. However, the level of creativity pales in comparison to the fantastical coral highlands and rotten veil. Even the clever use of every single imaginable shape and form of ice in the hoarfrost impressed me more than anything shown in this game. Plus, the endemic life was kind of lame, with many of them being slightly altered, real world lizards. Also, having to catch something for a quest that I already caught previously was annoying.  My general opinion: This game is deeply disappointing to me, not because it's objectively bad, but because I expected much more. It seems like they learned from the feedback given to world, but forgot a lot of what they did to make that game as good as it was in the first place. Also, as I was playing, many aspects of the game seemed like a collection of many good-but-underdeveloped ideas, lacking the depth and attention to detail I was looking forward to from this team. Aside from negative feelings, I was able to make a decent amount of fun of it, but cannot recommend buying this game before beating the majority of worldborne."
192319039,english,0,2246340,"What's so strange about this game is, they've sanded it down with the intent of finding an even broader audience, but the result would be mystifying to me if I was a new player. The game picks a healing item for me automatically, so what is the point of the plethora of different healing items? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) Sharpening my weapon just amounts to pressing a button whenever I remember it, so what is the point of the sharpening mechanic? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) You can beat any fight with any equipment, so what is the point of all these complicated weapon stats? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) It feels like, if Capcom were designing this game from scratch, 75% of these systems wouldn't even be in it. Because they all add friction and Capcom doesn't want there to be any friction any more. In that sense, it's kind of a mess.  Beyond that, the point about the equipment sums up how Wilds has broken the loop that made previous MH games so satisfying (already an issue in Rise but absolutely terminal here). Your impetus for hunting the same monsters again and again is supposed to be that you NEED those materials to win your next fight – and you need to master your weapon for the same reason. But in Wilds none of that matters. I will admit that combat feels great. But WINNING doesn't feel great, because it's no longer the culmination of anything except mashing buttons. The reason I want a real challenge isn't to prove how skilled I am, it's because a challenge makes you engage with the game more deeply, and so gives you a richer, more sustained experience, which you think about even when you're not playing. Without that, you're left with a nicer-looking but much shallower retread of Monster Hunter World, and that hasn't been worth £60 to me. And even if they redeem it to an extent through title updates and DLC, that won't restore purpose to all these legacy mechanics that now drag behind the game like a dead limb."
190858070,english,0,2246340,"It's a fun game. The combat feels nice. The new monster designs are all awesome, and the game's open world has serious potential.  But the frog has been boiled. What started as ""Quality of Life"" changes in World have slowly morphed the series into something totally different than what I think of when I think of Monster Hunter. So many legacy mechanics feel like they're in the game due to obligation. The Seikret trivializes mid-hunt maintenance, I had basically unlimited Mega Potions, Barrel Bombs, anything I needed, and without the need to gather materials or craft much. No more tracking. Wounding makes Hit-Zones irrelevant. The game does everything in it's power to push you back into combat,  which is also easier than it's ever been and is no longer about thoughtful positioning and commitment. Just sit on your Seikret and let it autopilot you to your destination. I did not fail a single quest my entire play-through. I had fun, but I am sad to see the series give up on it's own identity."

189505316,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is a great game ... just not yet and hopefully with some updates my review might change.  The Good  Let’s start with the positives. Visually, Wilds is stunning. Its environments are beautifully crafted, and the combat remains impeccable, carrying forward the deep, rewarding mechanics that define the series. The thrill of the hunt is still here, with weapons feeling satisfying to use and monsters providing exhilarating challenges.  The fishing is also kinda cool now. (Yes, that’s actually a highlight.)  The Issues  However, despite its strengths, Wilds stumbles in nearly every other aspect. Performance has been unnecessarily poor for many players, and while optimizations will likely come in future patches, they won’t fix the game’s more fundamental problems. Wilds takes multiple steps back from the series' core identity, creating an experience that is frustratingly obstructive and unfinished.  UI and Navigation  The user interface is a mess. Something as simple as adding a friend without joining the same lobby is an ordeal. The game’s multiplayer is somehow more obtuse than World’s already clunky system, requiring unnecessary steps just to play with friends.  The HUD is cluttered with unnecessary markers and information overload, stealing attention from the world and combat. Instead of immersing players, it bombards them with visual noise that detracts from exploration.  Loss of Core Monster Hunter Identity  Monster Hunter has always been about preparation, scouting, tracking, and finally engaging in combat. Wilds strips away these core gameplay elements in favor of shallow, modern open-world tropes.  Scouting is undermined by objective markers that tell you exactly where everything is, removing the joy of discovery.  Tracking is gone, replaced by an ever-present magic marker that directs you to your target without effort.  Exploration is actively discouraged, as the game yanks you back if you stray too far.  Combat, while still strong, is hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of hand-holding.  Rather than enhancing the experience, these changes reduce Monster Hunter to a streamlined action game, stripping away the depth that made past titles special.  Low-Rank Experience and Story  Early-game progression is a slog. Hunts are too short, often lasting only 5-10 minutes, making combat feel rushed rather than rewarding. Build crafting has been oversimplified with restrictive gem slotting, eliminating the creativity and satisfaction of optimizing a setup.  The story, meanwhile, is both forgettable and frustratingly intrusive. Unlike World, which gave players room to breathe, Wilds constantly shackles players with excessive handholding, preventing them from engaging with the game on their own terms. The first 10 hours feel like a prolonged tutorial, suffocating any sense of freedom.  What’s Missing?  Many beloved features from past games are either absent or underwhelming:  No home customization  No endemic life as pets  No meaningful mounts in combat  No significant collectibles  No raids  Cooking lacks variety compared to previous titles  These missing elements further dilute the experience, making the world feel emptier and less engaging.  The Verdict  Monster Hunter Wilds has immense potential. Its combat remains excellent, and its world is breathtaking. However, its misguided design choices, frustrating UI, lack of core Monster Hunter elements, and poor pacing make it a difficult game to recommend at launch. If Capcom can address these issues through updates and expansions, Wilds could eventually become a worthy successor to past titles."
189796037,english,1,2246340,"The game's optimization could use some work. Frame rate drops and occasional stuttering are present even on high-end systems. There are also crashes caused by Frame Generation. That said, the combat in MH Wilds is fantastic, it is very fluid, strategic, and incredibly satisfying, with a variety of weapons and monster interactions. Despite the optimization issues, MH Wilds is still a fantastic title and worth checking out."

189475572,english,0,2246340,Why is it such a chore to play with my friends?  The multiplayer in this game is circa 1995.  It's buggy. It's confusing to use. It gives errors constantly.   How this made it in to a fully released title is beyond me.  I would wait to buy this product until/when/if capcom figures out modern connectivity and fixes multiplayer.   What an absolute joke for a $10.29 Billion USD company.

190185699,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds had a lot to live up to, especially after the success of World and Rise. After spending over 60 hours in the game, I have a lot of thoughts. Some things are fantastic, others are frustrating, and a few are just downright disappointing.  At its core, Wilds is still a Monster Hunter game, which means the thrill of the hunt is there. The weapons feel great, the monsters are well-designed, and the gameplay can be really fun. But… there are some major issues that hold it back. So let’s break it down.  Gameplay - Fun in Its Own Way Monster Hunter Wilds delivers a solid gameplay experience that feels unique and engaging. Despite its flaws, I find myself enjoying the core mechanics, and there’s definitely a lot of potential here.  Weapon Improvements - A Step Forward One of the best things about Wilds is the weapon system. Every weapon feels like a refined and improved version of its Monster Hunter World counterpart. The movesets, mechanics, and overall polish make them incredibly satisfying to use.  Combat - Slow and Clunky Compared to Rise Coming from Monster Hunter Rise, the combat in Wilds feels painfully slow. Rise had a level of fluidity that made the hunts exciting and dynamic, whereas Wilds feels sluggish in comparison. It doesn’t even come close to the sheer fun factor I experienced in Rise.  Multiplayer - No Real Sense of Community Technically, there are plenty of ways to communicate, but the problem is nobody does. The game doesn’t naturally bring players together for multiple hunts; instead, it has this vague ""join a party"" option, which almost nobody uses.  Right now, it's basically: play with real-life friends or hunt alone with randoms who join through the SOS system. There’s no real way to meet new players organically, no sense of community where you can team up for an entire evening, discuss tactics, or just chat about real life. The old hub system encouraged bonding and teamwork—Wilds completely lacks that, and it really hurts the multiplayer experience.  Graphics - Unacceptable for the System Requirements The visuals are an absolute disaster considering how demanding the game is. It feels like a downgrade from Monster Hunter World—everything looks blocky and grainy. At first, I thought it was an issue on my end, but after checking the forums, I realized this is a widespread problem. For a big company like Capcom, this is just unacceptable. My PC is well above the recommended requirements, yet the game still looks underwhelming.  Modding - Almost a Necessity As it stands, mods feel like a requirement to make the game look decent. The fact that the community has to step in and fix visual issues that shouldn’t exist in the first place is frustrating.  Typos in the Config Files?! This one is just baffling. There are actual typos in the config .ini files. It’s a small issue, but it speaks volumes about the lack of polish in some areas.  Final Verdict Despite all its issues, the gameplay itself is REALLY good. But right now, it just barely makes up for the game's many shortcomings. Capcom needs to step up and fix these problems, because as it stands, Wilds is a flawed but enjoyable experience."
189122412,english,1,2246340,"This is my first monster hunter game. I spent about 20 hours in the various beta tests. during my time in the beta tests i went from saying ""i've decided this game isn't for me"" to being one of the ones who stayed up way too late on launch night to finally get to play it again. It took me a bit of time to get accustomed to the controls and figure out how to use my character, but once i had it, it hooked me.  is it a perfect game? no. it has its problems. but for the most part the problems are more nuisances than anything. To be fair, i have a fairly high end PC built in 2019, and i upgraded my graphics card to a 4080 a couple years ago. I haven't had any problems with performance so far. i feel bad for those that are having issues, but my experience has been virtually flawless.  Since this is my first monster hunter i can't really compare it to older monster hunter games. I will say that so far i have enjoyed learning the combat, learning monster patterns and finding new tricks and traps along the way. I have not completed the game, so i have not started into end game, but i don't foresee many problems in end game for my type of play. i don't mind grinding games. i have nearly 700 hours into granblue fantasy relink on PS5 and 200 - 300 in granblue fantasy relink on steam. i enjoy grinding and getting more powerful. so i anticipate the end game will be just fine for me. i will edit my review if that changes.  the couple of problems i have with the game are fairly minor. i get tired of monsters running away. and sometimes running for miles before finally stopping; even when they are near death. it gets so old trying to chase them down as your fully healthy bird can't even catch up with something that is hobbling and stumbling away with broken legs and wounds all over it.  the other problem is with trying to get into a group with friends. the system is beyond complicated. private lobbies are not easy to use and very complex for your friends to try to join. link parties aren't well explained and make no real sense. squads seem to be something akin to guilds. my friend and i are greatly confused every time we try to pair up. joining a lobby with each other often leads to us not being able to see one another. also, even if we are in the same lobby we aren't able to do quests together, you need to be in a link party for that (maybe? since i really don't have a clue) so it's to the point where we join a squad, a lobby, a link party, and then start a quest. for quests in the storyline if you are trying to do the campaign together, you can fight the monsters as a pair, but its janky. when fighting campaign monsters whoever joins the other one gets sent back to the main camp and from there they have to run all the way to the monster to take part in the quest. a monster that is probably half dead by the time you manage to join their quest and load their version of the map and run from camp to the monster; very cumbersome.   i have no doubt that these things will be slowly ironed out over time. it's too bad they weren't solved before launch, but ultimately it doesn't take enough away from the game for me to stop playing it. i am completely enjoying my experience in monster hunter wilds so far and i look forward to putting in many more hours."
189397889,english,0,2246340,There are no cooking cats. They don't reveal this to you and the hours go by and the hours go by and suddenly you realize that there are no cooking cats. And by then you can't request a refund.
188944350,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wild Review: A Great Game Ruined by Poor Performance  Monster Hunter Wild offers fantastic gameplay that stays true to the series' core, but its performance is a massive letdown. Despite having a high-end PC, the game runs as if you're on standard hardware, completely undermining the investment in top-tier equipment. As a long-time fan, it's disappointing to see such potential wasted by technical issues. I can't recommend this game until significant performance improvements are made."
189320522,english,1,2246340,"Granted. I'm only about 14 hours into the game (realistically 10 hours discounting idle time), I don't know if I can recommend this game in it's current state. I'm running a Ryzen 7600X, 7800 XT, 32 gigs of 6000MT/s ram, and 60fps 1440p native is certainly not locked even WITHOUT ray tracing AND with some performance enhancing changes to the game's configuration file. The high res texture DLC exceeds 16 gigs vram and increases CPU utilization to hit 100% frequently, so I just leave textures at High rather than Very High.  So.... with all this in mind, I'm running the game on an SDR 1080p projector with everything turned up to ultra +rt with FSR nativeAA and having a very smooth, somewhat blurry but still buttery experience.    Performance aside....  +Combat is good +Weapons feel familiar and powerful +Monsters look amazing and intimidating +Doen't feel grindy, repeating missions is fun. The loop is real and never unfun +The core gameplay is simply addicting af +If you came here to kill monsties and wear their remains... this is the game  -THEY GOT RID OF THE CANTEEN! NO MORE PALICO COOKS! WTAF CAPCOM?? -Auto running Seikret mounts are somewhere between convenient and a gameplay sabotaging mechanic (maybe I'm misunderstanding how to control them) -I miss Palamutes, the gathering area, a lot of the home base features from Rise -Story heavy content is not engaging. Discovering lore is not rewarding, dialogue is bloated, and I don't care about this kid or his village. Sorry, not sorry.  -Graphics are meh especially for how much strain they put on hardware -This ditsy blonde smithy works red hot metal in a crop top, and has long ass hair near grinding wheels and large spinning gears like she wants to get scalped with 3rd degree burns, just saying -This game is $70  If you have the best hardware, go for it. If you love MH, go for it. If you are just looking for a new fun game... look elsewhere. It's a good game for those whole know what they are getting into.      +30 hour Update: I've made it all the way to end credits. I repeated a few missions several times. Never got old. It does feel sort of bad to hit end game so soon for a $70, but Monster Hunter always has a ton of end game content that I am looking forward to get into. My system never crashed FYI even tho others report differently. I played exclusively in single player online. Just a few additional thoughts to add.  +Ray tracing performance hit is way less than many other games, in my experience anyway. Typically its a 1-10% fps decrease from off to high on my AMD GPU +Some characters become more likable. I would have appreciated more interaction with Olivia especially +The monsters get so much better in the last half of the game. They were already good, the last handful of fights were super fun  -I do not like the Seikret mounts! Aesthetically, behaviorally, and in gameplay they are inferior to Palamutes -As a long sword and switch axe user.... combat was more dynamic and fun in Rise. Wirebugs had my flying around the screen doing insane combos and damage while staying out of danger -""Mount and strike the monstie"" is inferior to Rise's ""mount and drive the monstie"" mechanic  Sorry for the long exposition. TLDR- Good game. Gameplay good, not best of MH. Needs performance patches. Needs palico cooks."
189274464,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter World is my favorite game of all time, I have over one thousand hours logged on steam. So to say I was excited for Wilds and all the changes is an understatement.   I have just submitted a refund request for Wilds, as even on fully LOW settings with DLSS performance mode my 3070/Ryzen 7 7800x3D/32gb 6000mhz build is not enough to reach a stable 60 fps in what is genuinely the WORST looking game I have played in recent memory. The game looks terrible. Which is honestly not a deal breaker, but it also FEELS terrible. Constant frame drops during hunts and in the village areas make what is already a poor experience an unplayable one. Even switching to FSR and enabling frame gen DOES NOT HELP, as I can peak 90 fps but still chug down to 30 when turning my character around, making the dips even more jarring.   Monster Hunter World looks gorgeous, miles better than Wilds, and runs at a rock solid 120+ fps, no dips, no stutters, no smeary PS2 textures, and no ai upscaling or generated frames.  Elden Ring, a beautiful open world game runs buttery smooth with visuals that put this game to shame.  Sadly both World and Elden Ring had performance issues at launch that had to be addressed through multiple patches, which seems to be the industry standard now. Hopefully the same happens with Wilds, but until then please DO NOT buy this game. Save yourself the time, energy, and money. I spent 2+ hours fiddling with settings and updating drivers for nothing.  I want to love this game, I really do, but in its current state I wouldn't play it even if it was free. Please do better Capcom"
189024025,english,1,2246340,"Aside from the optimization, this game is amazing. Hopefully they release a patch to optimize it so it isn't terrible for people without high end pcs. Runs fine for me, RADEON RX 7700XT and AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, but i can definitely see the bad perf on worse specs."
190519181,english,1,2246340,From the little time I've been playing MH Wilds I can say that i'm having a fun time hunting.  My enjoyment from the game reminds me and is comparable to when i played MH World I love both games but i do have to say that MH Wilds has its issues so i hope the issues get addressed sooner rather than later.   The game has so much potential and I'm excited for future monsters and collabs!!!
188977098,english,0,2246340,"Extremely promising game, but the performance and lack of optimization makes every form of good will garnered from the gameplay obsolete as the frame rate and stuttering is unbareable.   The recommended specs to run this game that the developers had provided is completely inaccurate and more accurately represents the minimum requirements to play the game. The recommended specs would get 30 fps on the best of days. With an i5-14400F, RTX 4060, and 64 GB of RAM this game STRUGGLES to maintain 60 fps and often sits at 45 fps on high settings at 1080p. Even lowering the graphics quality does not consistently improve frame rate."
189619533,english,0,2246340,"I really wanted this game to be good. I built a new PC primarily just to play this, so I won't speak of the performance issues as they didn't affect me at all. And there were also some positive things that stand out. Weapons feel smoother to play than ever, thanks to focus mode allowing to readjust where you are hitting, being able to skip the quest end countdown is something that was finally added as well, etc. But even considering that, there are just too many issues to wholeheartedly recommend the game.  My main grievances are:  1. Hunters have too much control. Thanks to the wound system basically adding a free stagger that any weapon can initiate at will so long as there is a wound makes the monsters look like clowns. Hunting Arkveld, the currently ""toughest"" monster in the game, is more akin to watching slapstick comedy. Between wound breaks, offset attacks, power clashes, flashes, regular topples, and natural traps if you use them, the monster spends more time on the ground or standing still than actively fighting. This also leads to hunts rarely taking longer than 10 minutes, usually averaging 7 at most.  2. Monsters are not dangerous anymore. If a monster does actually manage to break out of a hunters CC chain, it is till no threat. Be it the generally low damage of monster attacks, the lack of blights, wind pressure, and god forbid tremor (a literal landwhale belly flop and we don't get tremored standing next to it?), there's nothing a well timed offset attack of guard doesn't solve.  3. You cannot repeat the coolest fight in the game. [spoiler]You fight Zoh Shia once at the end of LR and that's it? No way to repeat the quest, no optional, no HR variant? We can't wear it's skin or use it's weapons? I'm sure i can hear the designers crying because they didn't get to make a nephilim themed armour with the whole Black and white theme going on in the fight.[/spoiler]  4. The absolute state of skills. I think the idea of taking a new approach to weapon and armour skills is nice. But the execution is severely lacking.  Locking certain weapons into a skill that is just objectively unusable on it is ridiculous (looking at you, crit draw lances).  But even if the skill would be usable, it might just straight up not work because a lot of them are bugged (e.g. Critical Element, Burst for HBG, ...). Locking a weapon into a specific skill is too restrictive either way in my opinion, but that's subjective.  5. The artian system feels very lacklustre. These weapons are the best in the game for the most part. The actual look of the weapons is at best mid though, especially compared to the other weapons in the game which are absolute peak design. And even if artian weapons have different elements, they all look the same. The way you build them as well feels very shallow and not engaging at all. It never makes sense not to go for element, there is no downside to just going 3 of the same element, you can't forgo element for a boost in raw/crit/sharpness or whatever. You always aim for the same thing. And when enhancing, you mostly just hope for a bunch of attack. And if you are unlucky, all you have to do is chuck the weapon into the ether and try again.  6. There is basically no endgame grind. The artian stuff feels like it was chucked on at the end just to have an excuse for an endgame. But in reality, parts are readily available from tempered quests that take no longer than regular hunts. If you are not planning on making a weapon of every type and element, you'll be done in no time at all. Same goes for decorations. It is obvious that the focus of grinding was supposed to be on something different compared to World. This in turn means, that getting all decorations is very quickly done as well, assuming RNGesus doesn't hate you. There is also no new mantles to unlock. You get a grand total of 4 thrown at you during the story and that's it. No doing all optional quests for a new mantle. Nothing.  While writing this review, I realised that some of these decisions may be to make the barrier of entry for new players to the series easier. But I feel like that is no excuse to leave existing fans of the series by the wayside. In World, i really enjoyed struggling with my friends to find a way to beat a certain monster, or a hunt coming down to the wire with 2 unfortunate carts. I enjoyed finding ways to make certain grinds faster with the variety of tools we had at hand. Finding something new to work towards way into the endgame. In Wilds, there's just nothing.  This game left a void in me. I was looking forward to it. I enjoyed playing through the story, albeit it feeling too easy, but I told myself ""Surely it will get harder in HR/Endgame"". And then I get to the end of HR. I beat Arkveld again. I am excited for what is to come when I hit HR50. What fight will be next? Will we get an elder dragon to fight? Zoh Shia again? What are these artian weapons preparing me for? And then ... nothing. I am left sitting in a mountain of unused relics, decorations and artian weapons. Okay, maybe it's HR60 this time around. I check. Nothing. There's nothing else to do. Hunt Arkveld 30 more times to reach HR100 to unlock more melding that I don't even need? That's it. That's the game done.  It may sound like I don't like the game. That couldn't be further from the truth. I still love the game, I see the vision, and I am looking forward to what the game will become in the future. But right now, I just cannot give the game a positive review. I will revisit this review once we see some more content and these issues addressed.  If you've read this far, thank you for tolerating my rambling. I'm done yelling into the void now."
189877669,english,0,2246340,"[h3]Not recommended with its current state (v1.0).[/h3]  It's a good game (not great). My overall rating is 7/10. Wait until Title Update 4~5 first before buying. Some points of the review is in comparsion with the base game World and Rise when they were first released.  First thing I'm gonna say is what I really like about the game. [list]     [*]Focus Mechanic - With Focus Aim you can freely aim anywhere now. This helps a lot especially melee weapons.     [*]Offset Attacks and Power Clashes - Great way of parrying monster attacks and addition to perfect guards.     [*]Slinger Gathering - No need to go the herbs and pick them up.     [*]New way of story progression. Not just: Hub - Post Hub Quest - Hunt. [/list]  With all the stuff below I hope all of them will get fixed and improve in the future updates!  [b]1. Optimization Issues.[/b] Game doesn't use the latest DLSS & DirectStorage versions for better and stable performance. For texture loading problems, it's as stated by one of the modders as well that capcom devs avoided using RAM/VRAM by streaming things when needed from storage instead of at boot time. All of these has been fixed by modders. And I hope Capcom will fix this on their side.  [b]2. Pop-Up Camps.[/b] There are a lot of QoL improvements but there are some changes that are questionable like the pop-up camps. What's the point of pop-up camps getting destroyed if you just need 75 points to fix them? And with the maps that are much larger than previous Monster Hunter games why not just make all the camps available and not have a limit of five. I do like that you can customize the camps now.  [b]3. Bad UX Design.[/b]  [b]First Alma (Quest/Lobby NPC)[/b] Before with the fixed Hub you always know where to go when you want to do a hunt or do something with the lobby. Because the NPC will not move and the NPC will always be there. Right now at least maybe more than half of the time since your Handler is the same as the Hub NPC, with her coming along with you on hunts, She will not always be beside the Base Camp Tent. She will most of the time walk around the Base Camp and you need to go look for her in order for you to interact with her.  [b]There is no bell sound anymore when someone posts a hunt in the lobby.[/b] Right now in order for you to get notified, when someone posted a hunt is through link party. Link party is good I'll be honest even when you are not in the same lobby you can still hunt with other link party members. But when you and your friends are in the same lobby and not in a link party there is no other way to know that someone posted a hunt aside from saying it through VC if you are in a call or manually typing it in game.  [b]Layered Armor/Equipment[/b] Back in MH World when we got Layered Armor you could link your layered armor set with the equipment loadout you are equipping. But now in order for you to change equipment appearance you need to get out of the Change Equipment and Navigate to Equipment Appearance. This is about 10 button presses average if your equipment appearance loadout is in the first page. Also for the Appearance Menu, they should move the Change Appearance below the Equipment Appearance because you will not always change how your character(face) will look. When changing equipment appearance, me and most people I know accidentally pressed this most of the time instead of moving down below first. For listed menu designs you will always put first the ones that will mostly be chosen to the least one.   In MH Rise the Layered Loadouts are in the Equipment Loadouts already. Even though they are not linked you can just switch between Equipment and Layered with LB/RB or L1/R1. They introduced Hunter Loadouts in Title Update 4 in Rise though. This is a loadout with equipment and layered link and an additional link for item loadout. This is really great especially for gunners since they have different ammos for different weapons.  [b]Raising Kinsect[/b] There is no Kinsect Tree. In order for you to know which Kinsect is better is after you nurture all of them. Back in World there are three tabs when you are crafting/updraging equipment and raising a kinsect. These are the list , tree and zoom view. Right now the one for Kinsect is default into a list view only.  [b]No Abandon Quest/No Mantle Reset on each Quest/Investigation[/b] I get that mantles will continue to cooldown when you are doing a Field Survey but when you are doing a specific quest or investigation from Alma the cooldown should reset. This specific review is not for everyone. But mainly who do speedruns or testing some things on a specific quest. The only available option now is ""Return from Quest"" and doing that uses up everything that you did during the quest (i.e. might pill or traps). You need to replenish the items everytime you do the run again. You also need to wait for the mantles to cooldown. Thus making it inefficient to do runs.   [b]No Copy Lobby/Hunter ID[/b] This is a simple feature to add and the Copy Session ID was already present in the Communication menu in World. There was also a shortcut key to view the Player List before in World when view the menu.  [b]Chat Log Notifications and how it disrupts viewing the Map[/b] The game taught us and it has always been the select key to view the map even from the previous game. In Wilds if there are monster notifications in chat, the select key will be the shortcut to skip the monster and to view the map you need to hold the start key. Every UX Designer knows that this is just bad for ""Navigation Familiarity""  [b]4. Story and Progression[/b] We all know that playing Monster Hunter games is always been the never ending hunting of monsters so I am fine with the story being so simple. I like how the story progresses now than before where you post the main story quest in hub and depart on the quest. I think they are moving close to a RPG type of main story progression with the maps connected to each other. And with locked out paths when you are being accompanied by NPC when you guys are riding a Seikret. And speaking of Seikret...  [b]5. Seikret[/b] Seikret AI is kinda junky at the moment. For sure this will be fixed in the future. Palamutes are the best. Change my mind.  [b]6. Endgame Stuff[/b] [table]     [tr]         [th]Game[/th]         [th]Deco[/th] 	[th]Talisman[/th] 	[th]Weapon Aug[/th]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]World[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]Selectable Augments[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Rise[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Selectable Ramp Upgrades, you can ramp up upgrades every weapon not only rampage weapons[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Wilds[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG, you can only reinforce Artian Weapons (Can save scum)[/td]     [/tr] [/table]  Right now base endgame hunting, there is only one monster that is worth hunting with the rewards. And that is mostly Arkveld. For full hunt rewards he will get paired up with a random monster and that is a way for you to hunt a different monster aside from him. Half of my saved investigations are Arkveld since other monsters don't have the same amount of rewards. The other half are those monsters with their Gem as rewards. But if you already crafted a lot of equipments that needs a monster gem. You will just go back to Arkveld.  Back in Base World you could always hunt almost every monster in High Rank since you are looking for Investigations with Gold Rewards and every monster investigation can have that reward. Also why couldn't we fight [spoiler]Zoh Shia again. There's no available investigation you couldn't repeat assigned quests.[/spoiler]  [b]Bounties.[/b] Before you could select bounties (optional subquests in Rise) that you want to do while hunting. And then choose a different bounty when you finish them. Now there is only Limited Bounty and they only reset weekly afaik."
190885605,english,0,2246340,"Never in my mind did I ever think I'd have to, at any point in my life, write a negative review for a monster hunter game. As a disclaimer - I am not a hater. I LOVE the franchise. Started back in Tri, buying the game completely by accident. Just by the art on the cover box, having no idea what I am getting into.  I fell in love with it, despite it's clunkyness and the game doing a poor job of explaining itself, but, by the time I finally fell my first Great Jaggi, I was hooked. The constant gameplay loop of killing a big monster, to make gear out of it, to prepare myself for yet another, even stronger monster - it's a magical code for my brain that keeps me coming back to this series.  BUT... It's not present in this one. Game has amazing fundamentals. The movement never felt this good. The weapon movesets have never been this fluid.  It's just a shame that all of it doesn't really matter, when the core aspect of a ""monster hunter"" game has been streamlined OUT of the game and now it's just a generic ""monster fighter"".  Where as the series started as a ""hunting expierience"" with player having to commit on every step, because there were stakes - now there are no stakes and no commitment. Before, you had to prepare your pouch for the hunt, carefully chosing items and stocking up on them. You had to position well during combat, because if you just go out swinging hands, at best you could whiff an attack and deal no damage, at worst you would get punished by the monster and get hit instead (and remember, your amount of potions on a hunt was limited, so you're being tested my friend).  Now, no matter if im running Dual Blades or Great Sword, as long as I am in range of the monster, it's gonna ALWAYS land, thx to the FOCUS mode, which ironically makes your brain lose focus, kinda zone out and let your hands just go through the motions. Feeling like you're fighting on autopilot, completely disengaged. Add to it the wound mechanic, which lets you stunlock the monster. The Palico that makes sure you don't have to bring healing items ever again and magically lays down a trap exactly at the moment that the monster is capturable. All those little things, and suddenly the game fails to provide any challenge. I could go on and on, but big content creators are finally catching up to what I've been heralding since World came out (because World started the trend, but wasn't nearly as sinful as this is) and they have already said everything.  Mechanics such as wind pressure, tremors, seem to not exist. They probably do but I finished all the content (which is not a lot if you skip all the cutscenes and if you COULD skip all the walkie-talkie sections) and I don't remember wind pressure/tremors or such things happening at all. Now - before you come at me, I did watch all the cutscenes, I didn't skip a single one of them, but my friend wanting to catch up to me, did, and he finished ""the story"" in 7 hours, where as I did so in around 20, and it's never a good sign if 13 hours out of your entire 20 for A GAME are filled with cutscenes.   I keep seeing these claims of the game's director that MH Wilds is a great success because of the story... No my friend. It's a great success despite the story, and mostly because World was a huge success. You are kind of getting the benefit of the doubt here, but you are quickly burning it.  This game has very little to do with what an actual ""Monster Hunter"" series was always about.  Expierience-wise: It's a game about hunting monsters, and as a hunter, preparing traps, tracking, doing what a hunter does. Gameplay-wise: Fight a monster, get it's parts, craft better armor, to be able to fight a bigger monster - that is what we would call ""gameplay loop"" in video game design, sadly, it's non-existant here.  Monster Hunter has lost it's soul and it's an extremly sad thing to witness. Because this used to be one of my most beloved things in the world, alongside Zelda, Mario, Metroid, all these big, passion-filled creations. And now, one of them is getting destroyed.   I might stick around to see Wilds getting it's G-rank expansion, but If the series doesn't change the course to revert some of it's streamlining, this might be the last monster hunter game I ever play."
188928667,english,0,2246340,"I was crashing a TON on a high-end rig, but changed my XMP profile in BIOS to normal, reverting my RAM to its normal speed, and the crashes are almost non-existent now.  Hoping they keep working on fixing performance issues so every hunter, old and new, can have a smooth and fun experience with this game, cus it is REALLY fun. Will change to positive after they address these glaring issues.  I think Wilds improves upon World in almost every way. The combat feels great with the new additions. The music and sound design are spectacular. Monster designs are REALLY cool so far. I don't care too much about the open-world aspect. It's kinda cool, but zones have always been fine. Almost out of low rank and looking forward to more monsters to fight! (pls let me put endemic life on display in a customizable house again PLEASE!!!)  Capcom, when will you stop adding so many hoops to jump through just to play with people!?"

However, it's impossible for me to leave a positive review for this game at its current state. It's probably one of the most unoptimized games in the last 5 years and Cyberpunk came out during this period. This speaks volumes! Capcom needs to pull their sh#t together and fix their game."
188913845,english,1,2246340,"""Monster Hunter Wilds: I'm Ready"" But RE engine is definitely not ready tho. Don't worry, even though it looks bad, at least it runs poorly. Trying to brute force RE engine into open world games clearly just does not work."

Such a shame because you can see the gameplay is there, the combat is there, the environment is there... would just be amazing if you could actually play it. I think a privately hired dude showing you each frame on flashcards as fast as he can be arsed to would give you a smoother experience.

191400647,english,1,2246340,"[h2]Monster Hunter Wilds[/h2]  I have to say that I personally haven’t had any performance issues with the game. However, I acknowledge that I have a powerful system, and weaker configurations might struggle. Still, I can’t criticize the game for problems that I haven’t experienced myself. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3438993521 Just like with Dragon’s Dogma 2, I’m so happy to see a AAA project that isn’t running on Unreal Engine that I’m willing to forgive some of RE Engine’s quirks, even though it’s clearly not the best for open-world games. It’s a shame that developers like CD Projekt Red decided to abandon their own RED Engine in favor of the more popular Unreal Engine. Cyberpunk 2077 is literally the most beautiful game right now, while Unreal Engine games often look similar to each other. If you play them back to back, it sometimes feels like you’re playing the same game over and over again. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3437765725 As for Monster Hunter, the combat in this game is absolute cinema. There aren’t that many monsters yet, but the developers have clearly focused on quality. The fights feel well-designed and polished. The game itself plays and controls very well. I think they’ll improve performance over the year, and there’s no doubt they’ll deliver more content. Fans have shown massive support by buying a huge number of copies at launch, so Capcom has no excuse not to support the game - unlike Dragon’s Dogma 2 (which, unfortunately, probably won’t be getting any DLC). https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3436312302 The story campaign is fairly short and simple, but it does a good job of introducing newcomers to the game’s overall vibe. However, while they made things easier for newcomers in that regard, the co-op experience (group creation, frequent disconnects, and inconvenient rejoining) could really use some improvements. A more seamless co-op system would be great. Overall, the game is fantastic. The combat is exciting, though maybe a bit easier at launch (some mechanics have been simplified compared to Monster Hunter: World), but it’s still highly addictive!"
191390519,english,1,2246340,"This game feels like a fine dining experience—elegant, delightful, and entertaining, but also pricey and a bit lacking in portion size. Still, with frequent updates and improvements, it could remain fun and engaging for a long time."
189007625,english,0,2246340,This game needed another few months entirely dedicated to optimization and bug fixing. There is so much wrong with the performance of this game.
191069105,english,0,2246340,"[u]This is a review from a veteran who started way back in MH3U and having played every single mainline/portable series ever since.[/u]  This is an unfinished game, unoptimized mess. With the developer intention of going mainstream the game just become way too easy with so much handholding in the early part of the game to the point that the difficulty is almost nonexistence and while still having an unchallenging endgame, being forced to jump through multiple hoops just to play with friends with the bloated co-op menu, monotonous and confusing map design, seriously i cant even memorized most of the map yet after 100 hours in and after already platinum'ed 200 hours later. make no mistake this is a still good game but seriously need more time in the oven for it to be great. in this current state i would say this game is still a ""premium"" beta. if ur new to the series and wants somewhat of a challenge go for World or if you really want a challenging experience go for Rise instead. Wilds is really just walk in the park.  p.s this review will be edited if the game gets better with updates in the future."
188998422,english,0,2246340,"Denuvo locked me out while I was troubleshooting start up crashes. Apparently, it counts every time you switch Proton versions as a separate installation. Thanks, Capcom, for using such an aggressive DRM!"
190336674,english,0,2246340,"The game is WILDly underperforming even on high-end hardware. Frankly, I have little to say that hasn't already been said by others. Performance aside...  1. There's a strange pivot away from the ""hunting"" aesthetic in this title. There's no more tracking, monsters are always seen on the map and you can automatically run to them (without any input, really). I can appreciate QoL that speeds up the game a bit, but these are key aspects that are required for proper gameplay pacing and made other Monster Hunter games feel the way they do. 2. The game is lacking some serious gameplay variety through features like the Private Quarters (from World). Because the pacing of hunts is already cranked to an all-time high, having nothing else to do makes the game turn into this boss rush with no meaningful breaks. To me this made it much easier to burn out on this game than on World. 3. I wouldn't expect an endgame given that there is no Master Rank yet, but I do want to point out that the game's existing endgame doesn't offer all that much. It's an upgrade from base World's endgame grind, but that's not saying much given how tedious World's was.  Overall, while it's a good new entry in the series, its problems currently vastly outweigh its strengths and I would recommend players to wait for updates. A lot could be done to address these concerns and I have high hopes that Capcom will listen to the players post-launch to release some much needed changes.  If you're still interested in playing the game, I'd say only buy the game if you're very certain that you can run it properly. The Benchmark tool, according to many, is not an accurate assessment of final performance, so do take it with a grain of salt.   I will change my review once Capcom has committed to addressing aforementioned issues."
188945286,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. World is one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay in this is good, because it's Monster Hunter.  However, if you aren't already a MH fan - I would stay away:  This game looks and runs like absolute dogshit. Actually, worse. It's pretty impressive that this team was able to take such INCREDIBLE assets like the character models, monster designs, and animations - just to take them all out back, smear them in horseshit and weigh them down with stones until they flatten into a miserable experience that is barely playable. With a 4070 and i7 14700kf 32gb of RAM I NEED to use a third party program (shout out Lossless Scaling) to make the game playable on medium settings. It looks HORRIBLE. The textures are muddied over from the (again, necessary) upscaling and everything turns into a ghosting mess. FPS will swing +/- 40 frames when nothing is happening at all.   Making the deliberate choice to use the RE engine for this after the absolutely abysmal fuckup that was Dragons Dogma 2 is fucking astounding to me. The level of disconnect between people who actually played this thing before launch and the reality in which we all live has reached a point that it should be studied by psychologists and philosophers alike as an example of incredible survival within a complete delusion and degredation of the mind. It's an affront to the effot of everyone who worked on rest of the game.   Don't plan on playing this with friends either, the system for joining and creating parties is, once again, a miserable and complicated experience that's buried within layers upon layers of disconnected menus and constantly changing hotkeys, with three different types of ""party"" for you to be in or out of at any time. If you are looking to pull up a friends list, hit ""invite."" and then start playing? Find a game that respects your time in that regard.  I know they still ""got my money,"" and I'm victim to ""I love thing and want thing so I'll play it anyway."" But companies need to stop releasing games like this. I don't think I'll be on board for another one. If you don't love Monster Hunter enough that you'll deal with hating yourself for this purchase because you just NEED IT - DO NOT BUY"

Absolute blast early game and the stories been pretty interesting so far, just beat Chapter 1. As always, the quest for drip tops all - and I will be doing Fashion Hunting, as always.  One small issue I have is the story is very rails - the Seikret and game pretends im in control as we go between points, but I am not at all. Would rather the game didnt lie to me rather than have me diagnostics check whether my controller is responding.  As always, dont appreciate the cost of changing character appearance and Palico, but Seikret seems to be free. Game is beautiful without any need for the HD Texture downloadable.

Some fights feel like they end too quickly, and I’d love to have longer, more drawn-out battles to really enjoy the depth of the combat.  But honestly? That’s a small complaint in an otherwise fantastic game. Whether you're a longtime fan or brand new to the series, Wilds delivers an unforgettable hunting experience."

188916638,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is the next major instalment in the Monster Hunter series. What Monster Hunter Worlds had, Wilds sadly, just falls short on what World's had. Not completely in a bad way but it is missing the ""good"" stuff about worlds - the end-game. After playing for 30 hours I can now tell you what I think about it!  EDIT: Review is up-to-date as of 18/03/25  Below I will state any issues, my pros and cons but first a quick disclaimer!  [b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b]   [h1][b] Pros[/b][/h1]  ⚫Monster Hunter Rise let you ride around on a palamute, in Monster Hunter Wilds you get to ride around on a Seikret that can GLIDE!?!?!?! I love it!!! ⚫So far, the improvements to weapons are amazing! Got my gunlance ready to be mastered again and now you can carry ANOTHER WEAPON!?!?!?! Now to swap between my bow and Gunlance whenever I want!!! ⚫Cooking has had an overhaul. Now, when you eat food buffs last a set time and they don't go away until the timer runs out, a bonus with this - the timer does not count down when you are in your camp... AMAZING!!! So much smoother now!! ⚫Each area is seamless so far. Full of life and stunning locales. Not only that, each area has weather that changes which adds to land itself. It really makes the land feel alive!! ⚫The monsters look stunning and all of their animations are just... spot on. I cannot tell you how much I love their animations and how amazing they look, especially with the HD texture pack. ⚫You can craft Artisan weapons which are insanely fun to use and to top it off these weapons deal devastating blows to monsters.  [h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1]  ⚫I have seen a lot of people say that the game is ""TO EASY"" - okay, it is much easier. MUCH easier, BUT it's only just out. Give it time. They can always add in Tempered or Arch tempered monsters or heck... a new difficulty bump setting at a later date.  ⚫Charging almost £10 for character edit vouchers is... not right. I am sorry but that's disgusting.  ⚫I have had a few ""performance"" issues here and there. A bit of lag, stutter and occasionally my textures turn to playdough. Another case of ""RELEASE NOW - PATCH LATER"". ⚫The end-game is a disappointment. You are forced to hunt the same 6 monsters over and over again - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna.... making the other 22 monsters completely useless. You will hunt the other 22 about... 1-3 times each and then never have to fight them again. Read about the end-game below!  [h1][b] How the End-Game works [/b][/h1]  So, don't hate me if I got this wrong - You open your map, look for 1 of the 6 TEMPERED monsters you are ONLY allowed to hunt - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna - if one is there, you save it as an investigation and you go do 1 field survey of it, then do the 3 investigations.   If none is there, you go back into your tent, rest (set weather and time to your liking) and then open your map and have a look again. If none is there, repeat. If one is there do the step above.  I am sorry... but this is the worst part of MH: Worlds.   [h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]  Coming from Monster Hunter Worlds and Monster Hunter Rise, Monster Hunter Wilds is definitely a step forward in some aspects but in others... 2 steps backwards, end-game and difficulty being the negatives.  If you are looking for a GOOD end-game, wilds sadly does not offer that, unless you don't mind brainlessly hunting the same 6 monsters for hundreds of hours for that one artisan weapon piece you need.  They have made Monster Hunter Wilds so much more approachable by making it easier for newer players. Do not judge it to harshly just now on that, its only just out, think towards the future for a DLC like Iceborne!!  [h1][b] 7.5/10! Many improvements but a lacklustre end-game makes for a dull experience sadly  [/b][/h1]"
190777174,english,0,2246340,"The game is fine but the challenge has been scraped away and the story is rather not desired. If you're thinking this is worlds 2 then you'll find it isn't.   It's a 70$ base game. It can handle a thumb down review especially since when it'll become ""good"" is when we all pay for a 30-50$ expansion."
188971275,english,0,2246340,Leaving this a Negative Review until they address the performance issues. Game constantly crashes and the frame rate is almost half of what I was able to get with the same settings running the benchmark prior to release.
188977489,english,0,2246340,"As others have started, optimization issues are the death of this game.  Honestly, I'm think the game ran better on the Steam Deck during the OBT than it did on release day.   I love this franchise, while I would love to give it a better score, I cannot experience the game.   A lack of modern hardware isn't an excuse for leaving a game unoptimized. There's no reason why my RTX3090 should be struggling, or for there not to be Steam Deck specific settings to let it run on there.  I will gladly change this review when the issues are resolved."
189974174,english,0,2246340,"Wait a year for the real version of the game to be released.   Also, Artian weapons are hideous."
189114692,english,0,2246340,"I've never returned a Monster Hunter game, but I'm really considering it for this one. Monster Hunter World is my most played game ever, followed by Monster Hunter Rise. I love these games. Even MHW had teething issues when it first released, and it was eventually improved and I was willing to upgrade my hardware to run it better. Wilds doesn't feel that way because:  1. It just doesn't look good. Textures are muddy and often incredibly pixelated. Hair, clothing, tents, wood structures, you name it, all look like a phoned-in effort at best. Once in a while you see a really nice texture, which only makes the rest look worse.  2. Despite the low quality textures and muddy sheen, performance is miserable. For reference, I'm on a 3080, and no matter what I set my options to, I can't break 60 fps. And once monsters come on screen, or any action happens, it's stutter city.  3. I know Capcom is capable of doing better. MHW and MHR both, IMHO, looked better and performed smoother than this one. It hurts to know they can do so much better, but didn't.  4. Co-op play is only ""sorta"" there. I buy these games to play with friends, and the way co-op works, you can't play through the story with them. You ""kinda"" can, but not really. It became frustrating enough that everyone basically said they'd just play through solo and consider multiplay when they all finish the campaign. Not the worse issue. Just an annoying one.  5. A loss of exploration. They touted that it was a big open world, however it's almost pointless to explore anywhere so far. When playing the story, if you wander too far from where they want you to be, they forcefully rotate your camera back around and tell you, ""no."" They don't tell you where to go, just where not to go. Frustrating.  6. Critics have seemingly ignored all of this. I don't why this bothers me so much. I myself am considering holding onto the game just because I love Monster Hunter so much. But the numerous glowing reviews seem very ""off"" to me for all of the aforementioned reasons.  Your mileage may vary. I wish you luck. If you have beefy hardware with all the framegen necessary to smooth out this mess, then all the power to you. I tried using the ""Lossless Scaling"" app to add framegen to my own setup, and it helped substantially. Though it still stuttered in battles, with the game looking worse than any previous Monster Hunter title I've played."
188953758,english,0,2246340,"I very rarely write reviews but i was looking forward to MH: Wilds as it looked closer to the only MH i enjoyed, MH World.  The fact is, the game is in a state that is not playable or acceptable for me at this current price.  3080 + Ryzen 5900x not being able to run the game at steady 60fps with Medium settings and DLSS on Performance is what it's actually WILD....  Will buy the game again when these glaring optimization issues are fixed.  In the current day and age where I can run just as incredible looking games, if not better, at Max Settings with 144fps, this is just simply unacceptable for me at the current state & price."
191947794,english,0,2246340,"[h1] Amazing Game-play, Horrible Performance [/h1]   I love how this game plays, but it doesn't love me back in terms of stuttering, frame drops, and the absurd lengths I have to go to get it to run even semi-smoothly. Despite all my efforts, setting everything to low or off in the settings, I can get maybe 60 FPS if I'm lucky, and the game looks like garbage to boot. The problem is it uses the CPU to render graphics instead of, y'know, the Graphics Processing Unit, so people like me who have a pretty good graphics card are punished for having a cheaper CPU to compensate. It seriously sucks that I can't enjoy a game I've been waiting years for just because I don't have the money for an expensive CPU for just this game. Save your money, wait until they finally do something about this, and if you already bought it, complain like me so we can force them to do something. This is ridiculous."

Performances are not great all around, and you will need need to run Reframework mod if you want not just better perfs but also perfect ultrawide support.  Outside of that I have a few caveats with the game: -Limited number of camps. Why? -Many bugs when it comes to skills. -Skills, as usual, don't tell you the value of what they give you most of the time, which is dumb.  Anyway, buy it, mod it, and enjoy the ride. It's a good game."
188988343,english,0,2246340,"Complain and let them hear you. This game rocks, but the performance feels sloppily done. This can be great, just need the devs to slot in peak performance for the optimization"
189253854,english,0,2246340,"+ loads of QoL changes added compared to world + Voice acting on player character - horrendous performance - lack of end game content - story is a walking simulator - no personal room - have less monster count vs world ( 29 vs 30 ), and there is reuse from world - alpha & beta set is just a color change, not a design variation - blowgun bind recoil to ammo type, and can no longer reduce it through customization  In conclusion this is a half finished product, somehow Capcom have a worse launch than MHRise, In its current state I don't recommend this game"
189012561,english,0,2246340,"Thanks Capcom and Denuvo, I love buying a 70 dollar game and being slapped by Denuvo saying they can't validate it. I don't give a damn I paid for this game and it's already been a nightmare to get this unoptomized mess running!"

189075115,english,0,2246340,"So two things, this game in terms of game-play is impeccable, easily one of the best monster hunters they have ever made if we are talking strictly in terms of how the game plays. However this game runs really, really bad unless you have a supercomputer, horrible FPS and poorly optimized, this game needs a few patches for sure and hopefully Capcom will do them unlike Dragons Dogma 2. Great game on the merit of the game itself, but runs absolutely awful, I think we can say by now the RE engine was not made with games like this in mind."

189110461,english,0,2246340,"Love this game, for me its easily a 9/10 maybe even a 10/10 I have beaten LR and rolled credits and I'm currently making my way through HR. But I cannot, under any circumstances recommend this game to anyone in its current state due to performance and I'm primarily writing this review to add to the discourse in a way that Capcom can respond to and hopefully address.   I am running a 3070ti and Im managing anywhere from 70 - 110 fps on high preset setting with some tweaks, how you might ask? By leaning on AMD's FSR with framegen enabled and dropping my resolution down to 1080p. This works to create a somewhat smooth experience, especially on controller where I feel input lag less, but what it does not create is a beautiful experience. The game is stunning and I say that as someone that thought the game was a washed out mess at first. When they allow it to during different in game 'seasons' colours begin to pop and areas really come to life. Unfortunately due to my settings FSR tends to make textures blurry and muddy, especially at a distance, so until they can fix the absolutely terrible optimisation my game will continue to look like this.  I will update my review if and when fixes come through, the more I look at it, the more I am certain this game was rushed out the door before it was ready. Do not buy this game if you aren't a fan of the series already, wait for the updates and by then there might even be a discount."
189002811,english,1,2246340,"Yes. The game is poorly optimized, who knows why Capcom went with the RE engine making a giant open world game, but it is seriously not that bad if you play on Medium settings. I was trying to play on high and it was terrible after playing for roughly 3 hours before I changed it to Medium. Once I did change it, it worked perfectly fine with no hiccups. Capcom do better, but absolutely stellar game nonetheless.  32GB Ram AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600 NVIDIA 4060ti"
188997656,english,0,2246340,"I'm enjoying it, but the presence of Denuvo means that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the game on anything less than very recent technology (RTX 40 series, Intel 13th gen, etc.)  To be honest, the game is just poorly optimized. I am able to achieve higher than 60 FPS on my own setup without frame generation, but I can still tell something is just not quite right. It runs worse than the betas did, but there's one word that easily explains this.  Denuvo. Denuvo is that word. Why is anyone still using this garbage?  If something changes on this front (I don't expect it will, Capcom is notoriously stubborn on this point) then I may consider changing this review.  Again, I am enjoying the game. But for the purposes of recommending this game to the wider public, I feel the need to leave this red so that people REALLY consider whether this is a worthwhile purchase for them."

189333958,english,1,2246340,"I have played every monster hunter game since Tri at least twice, and I usually play to complete the HR100 or equivalent boss on every save. I also played the older live service games, Monster hunter frontier and Monster hunter online. Here are my thoughts on wilds (HR70/50 hours in game at time of writing):   Positives-  POOGIE IS BACK  Monster hunter wilds is really fun, and anyone familiar with the series will like it a lot. The gameplay loop hasn't changed, and capcom has implemented a ton of quality of life changes that make it more accessible to people who want to hunt more and grind materials less.  The new monsters are all really cool, along with their weapon and armor designs. Capcom does not miss when it comes to aesthetics in these games.  As a veteran hunter, I was worried the combat in this game would not be as enjoyable as previous titles, and while hunts are the easiest they have ever been, the attacks and animations in this game FEEL SO GOOD you basically don't notice. I have not used seikret or mantels during combat to make it more challenging, and used un-upgraded starting armor through LR6, but throughout the whole story (both low and high rank) I only carted [died] about 3 times, and did not fail a single quest. I was planning on avoiding using focus mode and exploiting wounds as well, but honestly they are so fun and satisfying to use I would sacrifice the difficulty for the satisfaction. Despite the lack of difficulty, the gameplay loop and game feel is worth 70$ to me personally.  The story in this game is... an improvement from previous entries. The characters, cutscenes, and storyline are more involved and compelling than previous installments, but to be honest, I don't think many people are playing monster hunter for a compelling story. unga bunga hammer go bonk, and all that  Overall, the game feel is impeccable, and I will probably end up putting at least a couple hundred hours into it before its G/Master rank expansion releases in a couple years. Capcom has already promised half a dozen or more free title updates over the next year that will include new monsters and loads of event quests and other things to do in the game. For me at least, the $70 is worth it to satiate my addiction to this series.   Negatives-  Performance is really bad. I have a Ryzen 9 5950x and a 3090 and I am playing this game at 4k high, raytracing off and getting 45FPS. This is playable for me because I spent a decade playing on a 3ds outdoors at 20 fps, but understandably many people are not willing to play a 70$ game below 60fps or able to afford a PC capable of more than 30fps.  On top of the low framerates, graphical bugs are not uncommon either. I personally have experienced the ""black triangle"" 3 or 4 times in my 45 hours of gameplay, which causes a flashing black triangle to fill about a quarter of your screen for 20 seconds or so for no apparent reason, which makes the game almost unplayable while its happening. I have also seen the ""PS2 graphics"" bug, where some models appear to have about 100 polygons like OG Final Fantasy 7. For me this happened once after fast travelling and it resolved itself after about 3 seconds. I personally have not experienced any game crashes (I'm on the latest version of Windows 11 with the latest graphics drivers).  In classic capcom fashion, the menus in this game are heinous.  in particular, setting up multiplayer is particularly problematic until you figure out the system, so I will explain what you need to do to get it working the way you expect it too:  Basically, you want to have your friends in a lobby AND a link party at the same time. The lobby is basically how you can see your friends in the overworld, while a link party allows you to go on quests together as a group. you can go on quests together using either one, but for the best experience, you want both. To set it up: 1. you want one person to create a private lobby after selecting their save data on the home screen. 2. after loading in to the game, that player should get the lobby ID by going to the member list screen (start -> tab 4, labelled ""communication"" -> member list). The lobby ID will be displayed on the right. This player should send that lobby ID to everyone they want to play with. 3. The other players should select ""lobby search"" and then ""find a lobby based on ID"". (finding from in game or steam friends lists seems to have a 30% or less success rate, lobby ID works every time in my experience). 4. After loading in to the lobby, one player should go back to the member list mentioned before, and go to the ""lobby"" tab, then select and invite the other players to a link party. 5. The other players then need to accept the link party invite, either by holding the plus button on their controller after they receive the notification, or by going to start -> communication -> invites -> received invites.  From here, players will be able to see eachother in the overworld (because they are in the same lobby) and will automatically be able to join quests the other players post (because of the link party). Keep in mind a private lobby can have 16 players but a link party is only 4, so your lobby can have 4 groups of 4. You can also join quests from outside a link party by talking to Alma, so you can do quests with anyone else in the lobby, its just less convenient. You can have a link party between players in different lobbies and a lobby with no link parties, but you probably want both.  lastly, I personally found the music to be a little underwhelming compared to previous entries.  None of the negatives are severe enough to be a deal breaker to me, especially since most of them will (hopefully) be patched out.  EDIT:  After thinking about it a while last night, I realized that what really sets the old world games (everything before Monster hunter world) apart from the more recent ones is the feeling that you are really in an intense fight with a monster. I cant really put my finger on what makes that difference, but it has something to do with the players ability to move more freely in current games.  Old world games required a lot more intentionality and commitment to attacks because a poorly timed or spaced attack could cost a cart. I feel like I can get through basically any hunt in Wilds by mashing buttons on my controller while wielding a sword and shield, but I do look WAY cooler doing it in wilds than in any other game.  Part of what I enjoy about monster hunter is the community aspect. Joining a random quest to get materials you need and finding people spamming stickers and gestures and having fun in post game is as relevant as the combat itself to me. Those kinds of interactions aren't as accessible in old world games as they used to be (albiet not impossible to find).  I'm playing with 2 different groups of friends so I am having fun helping them progress through the game while using my own time to do fashion hunting and grind materials for melding armor spheres and artian upgrades. Capcom added event quests and more weekly challenges today. Even if I don't enjoy this game the same way I did old world games, I am still having a lot of fun playing it and it still feels like there is enough for me to do (although I wish there was more).  While it doesn't impact my review of this game at all, I would encourage anyone that enjoys wilds as their first monster hunter to play an old world game like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.   Update as of HR100/~60 hours in game: I was at steam review character limit so I put it on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7acuo/"
190034181,english,1,2246340,"After 60 hours, hunting every monster, and hitting HR 75, I think I can say this is a good entry into the Monster Hunter franchise.   The elephant in the room is of course being the performance and technical state of the game. Quite frankly, this launch is unacceptable. There's no reason for my new rig with a 4070ti and a Ryzen 5 7600x should be struggling to hit 60fps at 1080p. It seems like they really want you to use frame generation on your first bootup as a magic bandaid, but that's not how this works. Bad performance is bad performance. This alone would normally get me to give it a negative review.  But dammit, this game is so fun. It's all I've been thinking about lately. In terms of the core gameplay, this is the best monster hunter has ever been. Everything feels good to use, every weapon is fun, every fight is cinematic, and every monster is diverse, and in my opinion, more interesting than the monsters in base world.  That being said, it's not all fantastic. The other elephant in the room is the difficulty of the game, which has been a hot topic, and has been since World even. This was my experience: I played most of the game solo or with a buddy, and I honestly didn't see much issue with the difficulty. I'm not a Monster Hunter expert, but I'm not a beginner either, so I expected low rank to be a pushover and it was, no problem with that. High rank saw a boost in difficulty, primarily with the Apex Predators, that I was happy with. Not too hard (which will come in master rank I'm sure) but not brain dead. I rarely carted throughout the game, but I also played previous Monster Hunters and still had to actually fight. From my memory this is about the experience I had in World as well.   But then I decided to play some 4-player SOS missions, and the dynamic changed entirely. Most monsters rarely attacked since they were constantly getting hammered, wounded, and stunned, including late monsters. World wasn't entirely difficult either, but this slaughter wasn't as common place even with 4 other players. It feels like the game was balanced for solo and duo play and not much else, the monster health is super low and the wound status rate is too high, which just creates scenarios where 4 players wail on the monster creating perpetual wounds. A big appeal of Monster Hunter is the multiplayer, which makes this a bit of a disappointment. Teaming up in Monster Hunter usually always makes it easier, but it really shouldn't be this much of a leap to where hunts end almost as soon as you reach the monster. This WASN'T the case in World, I still felt like 4-player hunts were fun in that game even if it was a tad easier.   In general, multiplayer is the weak point of this. Needlessly complicated to even get into a game, in some cases even a downgrade from prior games in terms of accessibility. I don't see the reason for the distinction between Lobbies, Link Groups, and Environment Links. It just seems overly complicated and poorly explained. And of course, the famous communication error makes a grand return.  Arena missions are missing as well, which is unfortunate. Some of my favorite memories of previous Monster Hunter games were teaming with a friend to get the best time with the pre-selected gear setups, but that aspect of the game is gone. Hopefully it makes a return in a future title update or in the Master Rank expansion. (EDIT: Confirmed for title update 1!!)  And then there's some general gameplay changes, i.e. the Seikret mount, no monster tracking, easy escapes and heals. To be fair, most of these were introduced in Rise and were just brought back to this, but generally I don't think they were needed and likelycontribute to the lack of challenge veterans are experiencing. Hunters and Palicoes have more tools now than ever before, but the monsters haven't been buffed to match (yet) and it's starting to show the divide. Again, low and high rank are all that's available, so I can't say whether this is necessarily good or bad yet, but I can't deny some of the Monster Hunter identity seems to be lost. Tracking and searching may have been shallow, boring, and frustrating in the other entries, but it was a part of the charm of actually hunting the monster. You could argue with that gone you can get right to the good bit, which is the fights, but then it just ends up feeling like a boss rush game and less like a hunt, especially when ""prep-time"" feels like more of an afterthought now more than ever.   That being said, I have still thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game (and not done yet!) and think it's still some of the best gameplay the series has to offer, which at the end of the day is what draws me in. This is the perfect starting point for a new hunter and has a lot to offer. Just keep in mind Monster Hunter is famous for confusing progression and menus, and just have fun with it without getting bogged down too much. Looking forward to crown hunting (yes I'm crazy), updates, and Master Rank!"
189066635,english,1,2246340,"Guys, I like the gameplay and all, but could you add more menus to the game? I feel like there are not enough menus in the game. I would like at least 2x more menus for each interaction. Also, I think 2-3 types of party aren't enough to play with a friend. We need at least 5-6 types. Maybe with 2-3 menus each. Also, could you add 2-3 submenus in the main-menu?"
190904134,english,1,2246340,"To say I've put in quite a few hours over the past few weeks would be an understatement, so obviously I had a good time. If I take away some of my bias, it barely passes the recommended line though, and definitely with some caveats.  [h3]Caveat 1: Optimization[/h3] Let's start with the elephant in the room. The game runs worse than QWOP. You need a top of the line rig and preferably 2 to 3 mods in order to ensure it runs smooth enough on higher graphic settings. If you own a more affordable PC, there are about 10 different optimization guides and a reddit megathreat to help you out with making the game playable.  If that's not your cup of tea, don't buy the game until they fix this premium priced mess.  [h3]Caveat 2: Difficulty[/h3] I started with Monster Hunter Rise, and it was the same story back then. The new mechanic made the game too easy. Now I hear similar arguments about Seikrets making the game too easy.  I think a lot of people understate the fact that escape mechanics are relatively trivial in the long run. When I started in Rise, I needed that escape to succeed quests. As I got more experienced at hunting monsters, it started to feel like an easy escape button. After hundreds of hours the ability became trivial since I had mastered my dodges and evades.  When I started in Wilds, I very rarely used my Seikret escape button. It's because I came in with thousands of hours of experience. Experience that translates to this game, because at its core it's still a Monster Hunter game. As the title updates and eventually master rank will arrive, we will see a bump in difficulty, until we min-maxed those end game builds. Then everyone will be complaining again that it's too easy.  I don't think the same applies to new players though, or the ones that play every now and then. Monster Hunter in general is very overwhelming if it's your first entry into the series, and I believe Wilds strikes a good balance between difficulty, survivability and most importantly...fun. There is very little that stops you from playing the game. There is almost always something you can do through skills, items or abilities.  In other words, if you are a veteran looking for a difficult Monster Hunter game, I can't recommend this one. If you are new to series, and have a NASA PC at home, and are willing to install mods, I can recommend this game.  [h3]Caveat 3: Purpose of Monster Hunter[/h3] I hear a lot of complaints about how the series is turning away from its original purpose. I can't account for that myself because this is my second Monster Hunter game. What I can account for is my own reason for why I boot up the game. It's to hunt monsters. And in my opinion, that's the most important part of a Monster Hunter game.  Hunts may or may not last shorter. Tools may or may not be unlocked quicker. I don't know. What I do know, is that the fights are amazing. In between the 10 million stutters, frame freezes and disconnects of course. Whether that's 4 veterans absolutely destroying a monster, or just you, your weapon and your skills. There is also a good variety of monsters, given that this is only the starting roster.  In order to get to the fun part you do need to put in some hours though. Monster Hunter is notorious for feeling clunky at first. There is a flow which most people only start to appreciate after they have spend a substantial amount of time with the combat mechanics. Once you have found the weapon that fits with your flow, hunts starts to feel like dances with the monsters, and it feels great. That's why I keep playing.  If you're down for that, then I can recommend this game. Again, provided you have a NASA PC at home and a Nexus account for some optimization mods. If you are looking for elaborate preparation rituals and a deep understanding of the game in order to beat monsters, then this is not the game for you.  [h3]Caveat 4: Multiplayer[/h3] If you want to play with friends, there are lobbies, squads, link parties, hunter friends and two different voice chat channels. It's a confusing mess. Once you know where to look it's quite simple of course, but you need a 5 step guide to help you do this for the first time.  If you are more of a solo player, you can't cue up for SOS quests. Instead the game shows you a list of all the SOS quests that are ''available.'' You have to manually click on one, request to join, wait, click away a message that says you can't join the session, click away another message that says you can't join the quest, back out of the quest menu, select another quest from the list, and repeat the process. Just host your own quests, it's much better for your mental health.  [h3]Story and Music[/h3] Lastly I want to touch on 2 more points. The story is alright. It actually ties into the locales you visit and the monsters you hunt. It also has some cool lore bits if you are into that. But it's nothing to write home about. The monster themes on the other hand are absolute bangers.  [h3]In Conclusion[/h3] If you want to have some fun hunting monsters with or without others, then I can recommend this game. It has a good starting roster of monsters and there is more to come. The combat will take some time to get used to, but after that there is a lot of fun to be had if you ask me. Even when you got fights down to a science. Aside from the actual fights, it has little else going for it. Hopefully, for now.  However, the game is optimized so badly that I can only recommend it in good faith if you have a very solid PC. If that's not the case, I would wait until they have rolled out enough patches to at least make the optimization mods obsolete.  [i]Edits: spotted some grammar mistakes.[/i]"
189304061,english,1,2246340,"Incredible Game. After 60 and just hitting HR 100 I can say that - while I think the basegame DOES lack a bit of content compared to the release of the other Titles I played:  - Investigations are insanely fun - Farming for Items be it Armor or Decos is incredibly fun and feels like a rewarding loop that didnt get stale for me so far - Outside of 2 Figths every Monster in this Game on release for me is a good and fun one.   THE PC PORT HOWEVER LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED. Lots of graphical issues and the game crashes for me at least like once a day. To however complains about the difficulty: Yes the Game isnt that hard, but its fights are fun and imo thats what matters way more"
189158919,english,0,2246340,"Cool game, awful performance and worse optimisation. Capcom, if you do end up fixing the game and you'd like me to edit this review into a positive one it will cost you £3.49 for a ""Review edit voucher""."
188928780,english,0,2246340,"Ok, I'll say this Capcom. I love your games, I even loved this game so far, it has a lot of incredible stuff in it. I can see why people are giving it 8/10, 9/10, even 10/10. I'm even able to play it at a comfortable stable framerate with good visuals, because thankfully I'm blessed with quite a decent setup. But WHAT THE HELL is this lack of optimization and you trying to force Framegen on us? Not everyone is even able to use this tech. I saw how the game runs and looks on consoles, also not the best situation there.   You'd think that the whole situation with Dragon's Dogma 2 would change smth for the better, and instead we have this.   As of now, unless you have a beefy PC or an absolute MH fan, who'd play this game at a low locked framerate with possible sacrifices in terms of visuals, do NOT buy this game. Wait for a sale, better optimization, or whenever you have an amazing rig. This is the worst AAA product in terms of it's technical state that I've seen in a LONG time man."
189282970,english,1,2246340,"Performance is rough, but this is the best monster hunter has ever been. If you can run it, it is absolutely incredible."
188915707,english,0,2246340,"This game is absolutely amazing - but has the worst optimisation I've ever seen.  I understand that new games are becoming more demanding and people are expected to upgrade, but this is absurd. I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point.  I am by no means saying the game is bad, but in its current state, you should probably consider waiting for a more stable release."
190708376,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter has been my favorite franchise for a long time, and I am very excited for the new generation of Monster Hunter.   My first impression after 20 hours of game time, I feel like there are a lot of aspects that have been simplified.   There are no more hunting monster tracks. You just get on your mount, and it will carry you to your target automatically.  Another aspects I like in Monster Hunter is how important preparation is, but in Wild, that doesn't realy matter. You forgot to bring a warming potion, oh don't worry, the game has you covered.   I could write a lot of paragraphs complaining about how much easier this game is compared to its predecessor, but maybe people are tired of it.    However after 80 hours. I finally realized that Wild is a better game for me, at least now, since I don't have much time to play games anymore, let alone having to hunt one monster for up to 60 minutes.  I hope that with so many QOL's that make hunting easier, Capcom can balance it by providing new, more challenging monsters."
190363900,english,0,2246340,"This is being written before any of the game's major updates, about three weeks after launch. And it's being written by an insane old lady who started playing this franchise on her Playstation 2 in 2005, who cares about it more than she ought to. I also had a lot of fun in my 50 hours so far. Hitting 'no' on whether I recommend it isn't really a literal 'I do not recommend the game'. It also has nothing to do with the extremely valid criticisms of the game's extremely dogwater performance. Keep all that in mind.  I don't think my take on Wilds is going to be a popular one, even with as many critics as it's building up. Which is fine, I'm used to that, World is the first time I've actually agreed with majority consensus on this franchise, while before that I would have still insisted Unite was the best in the series. That isn't a popular take. But I really can't help but feel like Wilds has gone in a bad direction for the long-term health of the series. Not because of the shorter hunts or the 'lack of content' that you may have already heard complaints about, especially that latter one. I DO think there's some truth to it, I think even at launch World had a lot more to do, but zero question that perception is mostly from people remembering World in its final state.  My issue is that this game feels completely frictionless. The game doesn't feel like it ever stops me, it doesn't feel like it ever trips me up. Everything is so easy to do, not just the fights but supplies and food and inventories and unlocks and layered gear and, just everything. Your mount automatically sends you to where you need to go and everything you'd ever need is put in your pocket then the big monster dies after tapping you on the wrist a couple times and that's that. Even that example I gave before, there's just as many palico gadgets and we obviously still have a mount, but you just kinda. Get them. I didn't have to explore some weirdo unmarked nook of the map to do a weirdo unmarked quest for some random unmarked cats, I just kinda got it. Everything is laid out for you, handed to you.  There's good and bad to the friction being gone. I love that sharpening is actually possible to do mid-fight solo now, but I feel like it's too generous that my seikret can just pick me up to bail me out of anything at all ever. I'm not going to miss Nergigante's 'roar which stuns you for long enough that you don't have time to sheathe your weapon to superman dive away from his now undodgeable attack' garbage, but I'm not sure I like that trade if it means NOTHING feels threatening. Nobody liked the old deco drop rates but... I dunno, it feels a little hollow finishing my build 50 hours into the game. Half of this stuff wouldn't be bad on its own, and half of it is actively good, but all at once? Remove ALL the friction, good and bad, at once? It makes it feel aimless, insubstantial, braindead. The game is so devoid of ANY sort of friction that I'm sitting over here feeling nostalgic about paintballs and mid-fight combining, for gods sake. Those were NOT good mechanics, but in a room full of padded walls I'm craving something concrete, something with some weight to it.  I think my biggest gripe - and I KNOW this take is going to be super unpopular - is focus mode. I just don't think I should be able to throw out attacks nonstop without thinking about them and relying on focus mode's 180s to trivialize positioning. To me, the essence of monhun is the need for commitment, for planning, the fact that having to consider so many things regarding monsters and your own movement and positioning in advance not only necessitated deeply learning monsters' behaviours, but rewarded you massively for it. Landing a TCS on a mobile monster used to be a thing of mastery and beauty and now it's just... Nothing.  The game honestly kinda feels more adjacent to Helldivers than World. A party game that exists purely for small groups of friends to roll loot slot machines in. And don't get me wrong, I like those kind of games, but that's not what monhun was to me.  Regardless of whether future monsters do more damage and take longer to kill, that won't change the fact that focus mode makes positioning nearly redundant, that every single weapon has get-out-of-jail-free moves, that the big moves just aren't hard to pull off anymore given they're either twice as fast or have super armour or both and even if you do screw it up completely you can roll out of it before it's even gone off, that your seikret ensures it's nearly impossible to get combo'd out, that the absolute worst the game can do is put up a Quest Failed screen and take away the 5 mega potions you used on the fight from your stash of 800.  I said at the start of this that I don't necessarily not recommend the game. But, at present, I would definitely recommend you to play World first. Too many edges got sanded down, I think. It's lacking the franchise's usual weirdness, and its abrasiveness. You can give the upcoming update monsters 10 times more HP, but it won't bring back the feeling of satisfaction that overcoming those rough edges brought.  In retrospect Monster Hunter Wilds is a very ironic name for something that feels so completely toothless.  EDIT: I did not expect so much attention on this, let alone for it to all be positive. Thanks for that! Especially the people sharing their old hunting stories, so, lemme share one of my own nostalgic hunting stories as thanks.  I still hadn't 'got' monhun when Unite came out, despite playing 1, 2 and F2. Nargacuga was the flagship monster for that game and I really liked (and still like) its design. I got the quest to hunt it, suited up with my trusty old Akantor armour, and decided on dual blades for it. One of my weaker weapons but it felt appropriate. And, like, what's the worst that could happen? I wasn't even in G Rank yet.  I drastically underestimated how tough a fight it would be, and wasn't nearly good enough with DB for it. I carted twice quickly just from being blindsided. I played safer from then but was still getting knocked around.  I went through my entire potion supply. I kept fighting but got low on HP and ran off to actually use the tent to heal (a lot of people didn't even know you could do that in the older games lmao), and do some old fashioned on-field procurement of potion materials, despite being unfamiliar with the new map. I hadn't had to do that since monhun 1. I thought about going home for the hammer but despite the struggle I was just... having fun. It really did feel like I'd just met something that was my match and I had to knuckle down and learn it.  I somehow managed to keep surviving, but the timer was becoming an issue. I'd barely even remembered quests had a time limit. I basically had no hopes for finishing it off, I was just keeping up the fight as practice. But I kept swinging when I could. Past 45 minutes I stopped going off to gather even when I fell into fatal range. And with literally less than a minute on the clock, it died. Out of almost all my supplies, battered and broken, hanging onto my last life by a thread, but I managed it.  It's still my favourite monster hunter memory. As Wilds is, it's really hard to imagine it making a story, and a feeling, like this. World gave me some similar ones with some of the nastier monsters. Most of those memories were from Iceborne, though, so I do still think there's hope for Wilds to turn out some great moments with AT patches or the inevitable expansion, but like I say in the review, patches can up the numbers but they can't make Helmsplitter satisfying again.  But also like I said in the review, I didn't really like the games between Unite and World much. It's not the end of the world if Wilds still winds up mid after everything. I waited 9 years between monhuns I actually liked before and I can do it again.  Happy hunting, y'all."
191600679,english,0,2246340,"Optimized mess. Modern games need to stop using new PC parts as an excuse, there are games that look 5x as better as this that released years ago and run on older computers completely fine."
191935978,english,0,2246340,"Too hard. Too many Apex monsters use a new attack called ""GENERATE CRASH REPORT"" that can't be dodged and can't be blocked. And ends hunt, bypassing all carts.  Would be a great game once this attack is nerfed."
189006148,english,0,2246340,"Ignoring the glaring performance and networking issues, I don't understand how you managed to make the multiplayer so bad after publishing Rise.   When the multiplayer works, it has the same problems as World, like needing to start quests solo, find the objective, watch a cutscene, exit the quest, and join a friend to actually play the game together.  Why? You already had a good system in Rise. If you're going to do sequences and cutscenes, let me at least bring a friend along.  Also, link groups are a stupid mechanic. Why is progression not tied to the lobby?   For the brief minutes where I do manage to fight the monster with friends, it's a really fun experience. This game may very well have the best combat in the series. I genuinely don't know why you designed the multiplayer this way.  Edit: A lot of you mentioned playing from a squad lobby, and it did make joining after the cutscene much more bearable, but I still don't like the game's singleplayer oriented design for the story quests, especially when Rise and GU story quests both work flawlessly with multiplayer. (Haven't played the older games yet)  Happy to report that non-story missions work with multiplayer almost flawlessly in Wilds. I'm hoping once my group reaches high-rank things will open up a bit more."
192286286,english,1,2246340,"Disclaimer: I played a ton of Monster Hunter so my thoughts come from that position. I'm not a 'purist' who outright dismisses modern MonHun, there's design decisions I have problems with but my focus is mostly on the product. I'm mostly comparing Wilds to World considering these are ""A team"" games (stuff like rise/sunbreak is the B team).  4 key points: Content, Performance, Story, Gameplay.  Content Is always iffy on new Monster Hunter releases. The games are being treated like Pokemon, with an eventual big update dlc/expansion basically making the game feel complete. This is one of the more unfinished feeling experiences I've had with Monster Hunter. I don't say this just from the wealth of Monsters to fight, Tri probably had less, but there's a lot of gaps particularily in the endgame. The fact that the open beta had you fight the de-facto final boss of the game is mad to me. I genuinely had my final boss fight before the game released, it was way harder too which was super satisfying once I beat it. The game is also pushing stuff that feels like it should be basegame into content updates. The first big content update is huge but it also definitely should have been there in the first place.   Performance sucks. The game took 0 lessons from World (And the A team worked on this prior). There's just no two ways about it. You can watch someones youtube footage on a 5090 and they still get texture pop-in. World had massive performance issues at launch and the ones here feel especially eggregious considering World probably is a better looking game too. Try the benchmark.  Story I'm only mentioning because of how forced it is. They definitely wanted to focus on it more this time around but the problem is that it's just not good. It's painfully formulaic and the twist in the middle actually made me laugh out loud with how silly it is. My multiplayer experience with friends was hampered multiple times by one of us having to go through a forced walk-and-talk that you cannot skip. I don't think a strong story would not work in a monster hunter, quite the opposite, but it's definitely not exploring anything interesting with the setting.  Your character this time is fully voiced and also a total badass during cutscenes right from the get-go. Very hard to immerse yourself that way. I cannot understate how egregious it is that your character is being treated like a newgame+++ gigachad from minute 1. Usually monster hunter treats your guy fresh meat straight outta the academy, and you earn your badass status by working your way through challenges. Nata (the kid) gets introduced as the surrogate protagonist because you need a character who is even remotely vulnerable to have some stakes. The confrontation with the final boss may as well have had linkin park playing with how badass/edgy the setup was.  Gameplay. Lotta things I could talk about here. There's plenty of smaller nitpicks between a really awkward multiplayer lobby system and questionable weapon balance, but if I had to summarize the biggest issue with Wilds it would be something like this: This is the Monster Hunter game where they want you to feel like a badass. Hunter movesets are far too powerful, Monsters did not compensate enough for this. You are consistently overpowering monsters at every stage of the game. As others have pointed out before, the game feels like you are beating low-rank monsters with high-rank gear. Hunter movesets were made to be a lot more mobile which is definitely fun, but it also means that positioning matters less. Why reposition for a big attack when you can just press the parry/counter that is completely reaction based, on a very very easy reaction no less. Parries definitely do not come at a premium in this one. A lot of talk was made about how the Seikret was an improvement over the wirebug from rise, but I think people underestimate how powerful the Seikret is. The game doesn't outright say this but you can get knocked down and still call your bird, completely saving you with plenty of invulnerability, making it functionally impossible to die given how calling it is free. This is by far the easiest monster hunter.  My guess is this is also why the Story treats you like a badass from the get-go. I think this is a deliberate decision by the devs. This is the game about the power fantasy of being a monster hunter, but it feels unearned if the challenges aren't really there (or your character does something badass in a cutscene).  The content and difficulty in this game are intertwined. The grind in Monster Hunter primarily functions as the endgame and replayability, giving you goals to do micro-optimizations to your gear, try different weapon loadouts, etc. Problem is they hand you everything way too quickly. An armorset can be completed in 2 hunts. Jewels you basically get shoved down your throat (and I didn't even do the farming exploit that was meta for a while). And why grind anyway if I'm already demolishing monsters. I don't really feel the improvements to my gear when fights are easy and they are still easy with better gear. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of the series, I'm not expecting to get challenged the same way here as I am with late-stage content of older games. But this is the only monster hunter where I just feel ""done"" with the game. I've seen it all.  The future for this game is a little iffy. They clearly shipped the game too early and are introducing more stuff with their scheduled content updates. I'm not certain they will fix core issues with the game however. They talk about looking into balancing and I certainly hope their 'careful language' there will bring the overall powerlevel of hunters down, but I doubt it.  I'm probably coming back to it once the big ""rise2"" expansion releases, but until then, as I said, I've seen it all. I would still recommend this game as an entrypoint for newcomers if you have the PC hardware to properly run it. It's still monster hunter. It's still fun with friends and all. But after finishing wilds we went back to revisit sunbreak and had a much better time overall."

You really saved me there--I don't know what i would do if were able to play with my friends for the one game we have all been excited about for half a year. You know what? You're right I don't need friends anyway. Hopefully they will all get locked out too.

189044441,english,0,2246340,"[h1][b]Here's the most relevant reasons the game feels so bad until high-rank:[/b][/h1]  [b]1. Performance, and fidelity.[/b] Reasonable framerates on everything but the latest GPUs come at the cost of textures that look straight out of a ps2 game half the time. Why do my scoutflies look like minecraft particle effects when I'm not 2 inches from them? Why does having more than 2 entities on screen, or rotating my camera at all, cause stuttering? The difference in quality between this and other recent AAA titles is staggering. Wilds has such good designs and animations, which get severely neutered by the absolutely broken performance.  [b]2. Multiplayer cohesion.[/b] It is miserable to have to re-join a quest, only after someone has actively started the hunting portion of the quest, when you have played along the exact same questline. Not only that, even if you're playing in tandem, you have to ACTIVELY run away from the hunt you're trying to complete together in order to even re-join your friends, since the game gives you a connection error if you get hit by the monster you were immediately forced to fight. It's crazy that they managed to un-fix a problem I thought they'd resolved in other titles.  [b]3. Pacing.[/b] Good lord, it's miserable. Are you going to get a cutscene that forces you to leave the area immediately after a quest? Or maybe a dialogue sequence you have to skip through one message at a time? Or an unskippable auto-walk at the slowest possible movement rate on your seikret? After 2-4 of these, randomly chosen, you will be immediately thrust into a hunt that lasts all of 5 minutes. Repeat until the credits roll.  [b]4.  Difficulty.[/b] Worlds and Rise both had significantly harder monsters than anything in Wilds. They have tiny health pools that make it so you barely engage a monster before it's dead. Their attacks do negligable damage that is healed with 1 potion (or better yet by your palico which you no longer have any choices to make regarding their tools), and there's no threatening follow-ups to the monster attacks on the off-chance they even get you low enough to care. Wounds spawn constantly, and borderline stunlock monsters when you proc them. I never, ever felt anything that could qualify as a challenge, not even on the final boss, and so I felt like I had to rush the game to even have a chance at enjoying any gameplay, because HOPEFULLY high-rank is a little less trivial.  [b]5. Exploration.[/b] There is literally no reason to do any exploring, at all, ever. The closest you could get to an incentive would be for pop-up camp locations. Your seikret transports you to all but two destinations automatically, and the entire map and all of it's resources are revealed. There's no gameplay-driven reason to hunt for anything, and it is so sad because the artists put tremendous work into the scope and detail of the world, and the monsters, and the environments, and it all gets wasted because you're never made to gather monster tracks, or do an expedition, or hunt for gathering spots.  When you combine all of these factors, you get a game that feels like it's trying to say [b]""Hey, actually, please don't engage with me until the postgame, because every single system I'm built on is working together to make the process of getting there nothing but a chore.""[/b] It's insane how many systems they discarded that validated the entire experience of Monster Hunter. God, I hope high-rank has some challenge to it at least. It's unforgiveable how badly they designed this game in totality. Bless the artists, and the combat designers, but every director in charge of the rest of the game should be ashamed of the experience they've provided us."

It was fine in the 1st beta, but since the 2nd beta it has been causing crashes, freezes and insane FPS drops for me. - Without the frame generation, the game runs quite poorly on RTX 4070Ti. The optimization is absolutely horrible. - Enabling highest resolution textures causes constant pop-in, despite GPU having more than enough memory to store textures. What's the point in offering ab optional high-quality texture pack as a DLC if texture streaming is so broken?   I'm sorry, but I am done giving publishers a pass simply because I like their games.

189462918,english,1,2246340,"[h1]Preface[/h1] Ever since our beloved series reached the eyes and ears of rest of the world, Capcom has made a valiant effort to keep Monster Hunter titles in check with various innovations to keep the series fresh and appealing to a wider audience. Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.  In this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I'm not even looking at you this time, Rise. You're third place no matter what.  [h1]Positives[/h1] [b]Core Gameplay[/b] The core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I've been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it's all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we're all here for it.  [b]Multiplayer & Questing[/b] The lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn't hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I've seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don't see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to ""load in"" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of ""not taking us out of the immersion.""  [b]The Monsters[/b] The bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren't as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don't seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an ""identity"" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.  [h1]Negatives[/h1] [b]Repetitive Flow - For the first time ever[/b] Although the weapons feature numerous ""gimmicks"" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don't get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what's with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...  [b]Items and Builds - Unnecessary?[/b] I have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I'm almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don't really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.  [b]Lack of Central Hub[/b] The number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!  [b]Bland Story[/b] If I don't mention this category, I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with ""Acknowledged"" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] [b]Final Verdict: 8/10 B[/b] Although the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn't a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state. As I mentioned in the preface, Wilds is more of the same in this humble veteran's eyes, and you can sit comfortably in front of your screen and take heart in knowing that even if you don't buy it now, the game isn't going anywhere. The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the ""gotta play the new game"" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven't tried it yet.  Better yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal. One final note in that regard: aside from the achievement that requires online hunting, I still prefer to solo everything without any issue just because I want get those focus attacks in without interruption. Who knows? You might feel the same way, fellow hunter."
189435988,english,0,2246340,"Extremely fun gameplay but cant recommend in its current state.  Exploding polygons/vertices, horrible texture pop-ins, network errors galore. Generally horrid optimization.  There are also some bugged skills that currently do not work with Heavy and Light Bowguns  Burst - Only boosts raw and not elemental Flayer - Doesn't make it easier to create wounds Partbreaker - Doesn't increase damage of focus strikes  Elemental Ammo Tick Rate: Capping your FPS to 35 or 144 FPS gives you more Elemental Ammo Hits (7 instead of 5)   Info taken from Phemeto's latest video on Bowguns   Also a certain gigantic ice monster sometimes gets stuck between arena transitions and vibrates rapidly for a few minutes before it finally gets itself unstuck from the terrain.  If you have a good enough PC or are ok with some frustration along the way its a great MH game. Will change review once Capcom (hopefully) fixes these issues."

188932474,english,0,2246340,Gameplay is great but the optimization is terrible. Frame gen should not be a requirement to hit 60fps. I've played games that look a lot better than Wilds and they ran so much better.

For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. The game does not look nearly good enough to warrant this performance. Everything is covered in a grimy texture with assets that look like you straight took them out of a PS3 game. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this. Embarrassing. Wait for a sale and/or optimization updates. I've played games on my Deck that look better than this. When I was kid I couldn't believe how good MHFU looked on my PSP, an entire world in my hands. And now they release a game like this. It saddens me the mediocrity that Capcom has fallen into. But what do I know, maybe I'm just a little silly billy and my 4070 toaster is just outdated at this point. Guess I'll go back to playing better looking games on ultra."
189138464,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. I have 3000+ hours across the recent titles. I played World/Iceborne on Playstation and then PC over again when the PC versions launched. I did the same for Rise/Sunbreak.  I want to preface that I've finished the main story & beaten every monster the game has to offer.   This game, wholeheartedly, is a downgrade in almost every aspect when compared to the previous titles. It's ""OK"" - but there's a lot of things that are just... bad decisions. They'll sell ""fixes"" through an expansion, like they did with Rise, but it's still NOT GOOD in the current state.  We lost SO many quality of life changes. ---------------------------------   Graphical downgrade and terrible optimization. The game looks brown. Everything looks brown. There's filters/settings enabled that just makes it look *bad* - Sometimes, like in the lush forest, it looks incredible when the fog is off... but everywhere else it looks washed out. The FPS is awful (There's a typo in the config file you can fix to add a little more) and you will struggle to get over 60 FPS on average/decent computers.  No idea what happened in testing.  ---------------------------------  Multiplayer is terribly implemented. There's lobbies, link parties, environment links, and a billion other things you need to juggle just to play with people. We seriously went from >make lobby >join lobby >post quests and play... to whatever this is. Even if you're IN THE ENVIRONMENT LINK WITH FRIENDS you still get disconnected sometimes after defeating a single monster. It makes no sense.   You're forced into 'cutscene gates' where you can't do things with people until you see certain things.. something that was FIXED in World because it was SO HATED AND ANNOYING. It's back! Playing with friends is ROUGH until you're at the end of the game.  ---------------------------------  The game is incredibly theme-parky and ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES exploration. You are tethered to certain areas while doing any story mode missions. World encouraged vertical exploration and players to go around on their own, but on here everything is listed, shown, and auto-pathed to by your mount.   There is no central hub, so it feels like you're constantly jumping around ""exhibits"" to find NPC's, quests, turn things in, and do whatever. It's very broken up, sparse, and feels incredibly clunky and jarring to navigate compared to the previous two titles (and even older ones). I guess they're adding a central hub eventually but didn't have enough time? Sucks.  It feels like they took Frontiers and mutilated it, trying to have an ""MMO FEEL"" without any MMO mechanics. I cannot tell you the number of times I've had to look everywhere to find where to turn in quests.   Even things like MAP MARKERS for camps are buried by other markers IN CAMPS and they're really difficult to see/fast travel to. The way the list of camps were shown in World made it *brain dead easy* to find... How did we go to this?  ---------------------------------  The story is very bland. I'd even say that it's awful. I won't go into spoilers or specifics, but there's absolutely no ""big catastrophe"" you're trying to avert or anything major that's being built up to.   Most of the dialogue is patronizing, condescending, or very ""life is special"" - and it just rings really hokey. There's also not even a dragonator anywhere in the entire game. I'd put it on the same level as ""base"" Rise's story, which says a lot.  There's very few memorable characters, moments, or anything along those lines. Part of what makes some of the story of the previous titles so good is how extra and over the top some of the characters are. Again, no dragonator moments.  It can also be completed in less than 10 hours without rushing. It just kinda.. ends.  ---------------------------------  The experience feels soulless. I dunno how else to put it other than feeling like nothing is inspired, and more like everything was ""lets do this again"" in Wilds. It feels like there was no vision beyond ""Make another World game"" and Capcom executives yelling at the developers to do so. The phrase I've heard a LOT of friends using (who are veterans of MH far longer than I am, since the original) is that it feels *incredibly* corporate.  You kinda just get it as a vibe. As you play through, the longer you play through, you'll understand what I mean.  ---------------------------------  Monster variety is very limited, and there's nothing really ""stand out"". Even the flagship monster is uninspired compared to previous title flagship monsters. Going through the entire game, killing every single monster available, I cannot think of a single one that impressed me or made me go ""woah"" on the same level of things like Vaal Hazak, Velkhana, Malzeno, Xeno'Jiiva, etc had to offer. It feels like you're fighting three archetypes the entire game.  A lot of monsters are repeats from previous games, including the movesets and skeletons (which have been used on a few of the new ones), which is a bit disappointing considering how few actually exist.  I'm actually worried about future content because most of the announced monsters are just filler/mid tier monsters... and the game's already done. The escalation wont be there unless they add things like Alatreon, etc, alongside smaller threats.  ---------------------------------  There's no endgame. You farm two or three tempered monsters at the end and that's it. There's no carrot on a stick to pursue and you'll be done as a dedicated player within a few days.  I won't go into extreme detail but yeah, nada.  ---------------------------------  Decorations are really weird now. Most attack based ones can only be put on weapons (Such as ballistics, etc), which means only 3 slot weapons can fit them. Three slot slots on armor/etc CANNOT wear the same decorations as weapons. This severely limits builds. Most armor sets also are just *incredibly* lackluster when it comes to skills provided.  I get this limits player power but.. it just feels really clunky on how they did it.  ---------------------------------  The entire new wound system is just clutch claw from Iceborne but way more auto-pilot. You do huge amounts of damage while wounding, get free materials, and CONSTANTLY KNOCK DOWN MONSTERS from applying wounds. There's fights you're going to do later once you're geared where monsters cannot get up off of the ground.   People complained about the clutch-claw gameplay and this is just the exact thing.. but WAY more  overtuned and broken. Even the hardest monsters the game has to offer kinda get destroyed by any sort of wound mechanic.  ---------------------------------  The food system is a downgrade. I get what they were going for but in simplifying it they've made it kinda awful. Getting materials sucks, the stores that sell/offer ingredients only seem to give you rations, and the bonuses from food are lackluster. We went from having major defense up, attack up, ammo conservation, and all these other awesome things to just basic buffs.   NOT TO MENTION THERE'S NO PALICO CUTSCENES FOR FOOD COOKING. RIP Grandma food cat.  ---------------------------------  The camera is awful. Monsters are bigger than your screen and tracking is bad. Can't count the number of times later that bigger monsters are just 95% of your screen and you can't see what they're doing fast enough. Even at max zoom/focus it's a downgrade from World.  ---------------------------------  I *want* this game to be better than it is and I know they'll make it better in the future, but man, I wouldn't be surprised if I see lots of people going back to play World/Iceborne after a couple of weeks of Wilds.  Monster Hunter fans will still find enjoyment in the game but the entire way through you'll probably be thinking ""I miss this"" or ""This is clunky"" or ""This was done better"" - and that's just sad to me."

Avoid buying until you hear that Capcom has made the game actually run well on your machine; make sure to check with the benchmark before you buy. I won't be surprised if/when a crack comes out and the game runs way better with it."

189397727,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter is my childhood series of nearly 16 years,  [h1]Optimisations are not the sole issue.[/h1]  Performance [i]has been[/i] unnecessarily poor for many people. However, [b]fixing this will not solve the game's frustrating nature.[/b]  [h3]Visual design is great. Combat has been truly impeccable. However, every other sect of direction has lain the devil in the details, creating a grossly obstructive and discouraging experience while taking multiple steps back from the whole series. It's clear the game is unfinished.[/h3]  As a whole package, when only one of the main components established over 20+ years is done well and worthwhile side content is summed up by 'the fishing's kinda cool now', there is a huge problem.  So TL;DR: Roundabout and cluttered UI, [b]a gutting of series mechanics without fun, appropriate replacements[/b] and a story whose beats are brief and forgettable on purpose, yet is frustratingly paced, stretched and ground down rails like something worth telling - handholding far exceeding time actually spent hunting. Insult to injury comes from ignoring Rise for an obtuse multiplayer worse than World's painful 'leave and restart the quest to let friends join' system.   All to imprison you in a title whose major innovation is finally being open world for 'player freedom'.  [h2]So how does this begin to come together?[/h2]  On UI:  Try adding a friend you already know through this game without joining the same lobby. There's no dedicated ""Friends"" menu. You will probably take 10 minutes. Wanna play together? Go to the same lobby. Now you need a link party. Now you need to...  It is [i]all[/i] a sub menu jungle: poorly planned, explained and labelled.  More importantly, there's a HUD ripped from a 'corporate open world slop' mockup you'd find around Elden Ring's release. Most of it can be customised, but there's a beady, omnipresent and unremovable objective marker, duplicated on the un-customisable minimap telling you where everything is through visual barf; it all blends together.  [h3]These features are notorious for stealing your attention from a game. Perhaps forgivable elsewhere, but 2 of Monster Hunter's core components are attacked by this. One by being cheaply replaced. It actually [b]strips the series' special identity.[/b] [/h3]  [h2]What are they and why are they important then?[/h2]  1) [b]Preparation.[/b] Straight forward step. Pick out your items and equipment. Eat. Head out. It's a light strategic phase relying on memory and your personal preference. Without it you make life 10x harder.  2) [b]Scouting and foraging.[/b] Huge part of what makes MH special. Exploration and becoming familiar with a location, its details and secrets were given similar importance to learning the behaviors and patterns of the monster you hunted because of how they - and you - are intertwined. Your understanding is personal and ropes you into feeling part of the world. Since environmental hazards came out, this saw explicit gameplay reward too.  3) [b]Tracking.[/b] Before World it was your way to secure your combat reward for good scouting, with light management because paintballs wore off. World made it an additional reason to engage with the environment; how well it was done is up to interpretation.  4) [b]Combat and chase.[/b] Self explanatory. The meat of the game and main reward for locating the target monster.  You may notice these are simplified steps to actual hunting.   [h3]So which of these are attacked exactly?[/h3]  [b]Scouting:[/b] Immediately knowing where everything is defeats the need and incentive to explore. How the hell are we expected to care for cool spots we never discovered ourselves? Stray too far and the game yanks you away for daring to look at something new. Somehow they removed joy and wonder from higher tier environment design. At least they let us physically ignore 90% of the world by holding a button to laser focus on text in the most braindead iteration of gathering to ever grace us.  [b]Tracking:[/b] This is what's removed outright, replaced by the tacky magic objective marker. Tracks still exist but only give you currency. Scout flies became useless by World's endgame so that's why? [b]Well there's a clear rework they could've done:[/b]  Believe it or not sneak attacks and bushes exist as afterthoughts to some basic stealth system. If they wanted to remove tracking, [b]why wasn't the level design built with engaging stalking in mind, where some monsters only stayed to fight or could lose their special power if we snuck up on them first?[/b] What if our ""intelligent"" seikret could be taught to help with this? Why didn't they replace scoutflies with the raptor following scents?   Wanted to keep the flies and tracking anyway? Have them trained to only follow monsters tagged by paint for the whole hunt. Ruin hiding tactics or some amazing camouflage that's hard to see with the naked eye. It's reason to care about rain too.  Right now, only having prep for battle sounds like a glorified boxing ring. [b]""Monster Brawler"" is not the name of the series.[/b]  [h3]Anything else of value?[/h3]  Each of these are so far absent:  -Home customisation -Endemic life as pets -Mounts engaging in combat -Collectables -Raids  Cooking skill variety is pretty sad compared to every other game too.  MH games always offered 'extra'. (Raids would need improving)  [h2]But the combat's still good, right? How does this affect me?[/h2]  [h3]Lazy choices disrespecting core identity lead to lazy choices disrespecting you and this is present throughout. Not just in boring navigation, backwards menus or some nightmare 4-5 steps with recursive loop to playing multiplayer with friends. So how does combat fare...?[/h3]  [h1]Low Rank is Hell.[/h1]  The mind-numbing kind.  1) [b]A top complaint is hunts being too short.[/b] The devs failed to develop a new, fun, gameplay buildup to engage with before fighting, nor have they balanced the combat to really let you partake in this part's stellar system. 5-10 minutes when hours deep is immensely dissatisfying. It's a potato chip experience: tastes great but is gone too soon. Rise and World got it just right.  2) [b]Build crafting.[/b] Decorations are segregated on whether they're a 'weapon gem' or 'armor gem', removing creative slot management and the satisfaction of optimal builds how [i]you[/i] wanted. Very old games would add to one skill and take from another. Balancing that prevented OP builds better than this restrictive, over-corrective mess.  3) [b]Then there's the story.[/b] World let you breathe - Wilds crushes your windpipe. Progression for ~75% of your first 8-16Hrs is stuck in the most shallow, uninspired nothingburger drivel, forcibly handholding you throughout it all. Some interesting lore and that's it. Frequent are shacklings to tiny spaces just in case you wanted to - God forbid - play the game. Combine how [i]short[/i] the hunts are and the bore drills deep.  [h2]So what's the recurring problem here?[/h2]  [h3]Everything is designed to stop you engaging with the game, both implicitly and explicitly. Going so far as to hollow the experience out and prescribe you a narrow vision on how to interact until finally opening up by endgame. Dozens of hours in.[/h3]  Unlike any other MonHun, you can't really look, learn or enjoy outside combat. Minimal side content. Constant nags on where to go, where to stand, who to speak to and when play's allowed between each. And every. Quest... Sounds like a school - that fun to you?  And it's tragic because there are cool, fun little details with beauty to witness. Again, combat is fantastic. But for all these efforts to make the game worth playing, someone in Capcom's out of touch management either refused to let the game cook or stirred the pot, thinking MH as 'just another action game' when the legs are built on so much more. Now sloppy and missing features encroach on what gives it character.  World:Iceborne remains king. Sunbreak is queen."

188919890,english,0,2246340,Super unoptimised runs like shit. You shouldnt use the launch as an excuse to deliver an unoptimised game. This is whats wrong with the modern game industry. The game has so much potential and I would play the shit out of it if it was optimised. I have above reccomended specs btw. Send all the clown awards you want but that wont fix the shitty unoptimised game.

188939251,english,0,2246340,"AMD BEWARE  I generally dislike leaving negative reviews when a game just released because I'm afraid it'll seem like jumping on the ""hate the popular thing"" bandwagon etc. However. The perfomances are one thing I can ignore, it doesn't run good but it runs well enough on my machine, I can wait for updates for that  What I cannot ignore however is the inability of the game working on top of the line AMD GPUs, I have a 7900XT and the game crashed on startup, until I figured I had to turn on WINDOWS 7/8 COMPATIBILITY MODE IN THE EXECUTABLE PRORIETIES   And that's where the huge problem lies, if you turn on Comp mode, half of the textures shit themselves, I'm not talking about a lttle artifact here and there, I'm talking about a MASSIVE artifact covering the ENTIRE screen as soon as there's a rock in frame, this is unnacceptable especially for the flagship product of a company  And you cannot turn it off once you booted, you'd think maybe the issue was shaders compiling, or something But no. Turning off comp mode brings the game back to crash on startup  I still put up with it considering it's either that or no monstie at all, but the review is a solid negative and will stay as is until the problem get hotfixed.  AMD BEWARE unless you're ready to have your eyes bleed. For now at least.  Those armour sets are banging though."
189223176,english,0,2246340,"This might get drowned out by all the reviews about performance, but there are many issues I had with the game past that.  Difficulty: I used pc controls and the lance for the first time for my playthrough and didn't even need to craft armor until Guardian Doshagama, going from 11 defense to 131. From there it was a cake walk just by using what random materials I had from doing quests, even beating a tempered Arkveld right after beating the main story with no problem still using random bs. I understand wanting to make a game accessible to all skill levels, but doing it to this degree gives most players no reason to interact with the open world at all during the story, and considering the lack of postgame, basically invalidates the open world as a whole.  Weapon and combat changes: Counter reliance is bad for monster hunter, and every weapon has some form of counter in this game, with certain weapons revolving around spamming counters now. Plus, certain overtuned attacks have made some weapons lose nuance in gameplay, and in conjunction with wound attacks, makes the combat feel really spammy. Also, the combination of wounds, clashes, and offsets really thrashes the monsters around, making even returning threats feel more pathetic than ever. The majority of combat changes seem to prioritize making the game more cinematic and satisfying over giving it mechanical depth, which I can enjoy for one game, but I hope that design philosophy is a one time thing. [Additional minor nitpick: what kind of logic makes wounds go away when you hit them, and makes it so you can only do certain combos if you start them by hitting a wound?]  Content and pacing: I beat every main quest, side quest, and monster available at launch in 27~ hours of gameplay, and I wasn’t really in much of a rush. What’s arguably worse is that you pretty much fight the final boss in low rank, and the entirety of high rank feels like postgame, with its final fight being a rematch from low rank. Then, there is basically no actual post game other than fighting a handful of tempered monsters harder than what you get from doing the main high rank quests.  Monsters: The new monsters are fine. Since it's a subjective topic, all I care to mention is that the movesets of some seem shallow, and many of their moves plus the new moves given to old monsters seem poor at indicating the direction and space they’re gonna take up. I also think they lack the charm found in many classic monster hunter monsters, but that can be applied to monsters from rise and world as well.  The environment: It's decent, which is devastating in comparison to how amazing the locales were in world. Not including graphical issues, it can be ugly and dark and boring at times, but can certainly be beautiful, especially in the ruins. However, the level of creativity pales in comparison to the fantastical coral highlands and rotten veil. Even the clever use of every single imaginable shape and form of ice in the hoarfrost impressed me more than anything shown in this game. Plus, the endemic life was kind of lame, with many of them being slightly altered, real world lizards. Also, having to catch something for a quest that I already caught previously was annoying.  My general opinion: This game is deeply disappointing to me, not because it's objectively bad, but because I expected much more. It seems like they learned from the feedback given to world, but forgot a lot of what they did to make that game as good as it was in the first place. Also, as I was playing, many aspects of the game seemed like a collection of many good-but-underdeveloped ideas, lacking the depth and attention to detail I was looking forward to from this team. Aside from negative feelings, I was able to make a decent amount of fun of it, but cannot recommend buying this game before beating the majority of worldborne."
192319039,english,0,2246340,"What's so strange about this game is, they've sanded it down with the intent of finding an even broader audience, but the result would be mystifying to me if I was a new player. The game picks a healing item for me automatically, so what is the point of the plethora of different healing items? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) Sharpening my weapon just amounts to pressing a button whenever I remember it, so what is the point of the sharpening mechanic? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) You can beat any fight with any equipment, so what is the point of all these complicated weapon stats? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) It feels like, if Capcom were designing this game from scratch, 75% of these systems wouldn't even be in it. Because they all add friction and Capcom doesn't want there to be any friction any more. In that sense, it's kind of a mess.  Beyond that, the point about the equipment sums up how Wilds has broken the loop that made previous MH games so satisfying (already an issue in Rise but absolutely terminal here). Your impetus for hunting the same monsters again and again is supposed to be that you NEED those materials to win your next fight – and you need to master your weapon for the same reason. But in Wilds none of that matters. I will admit that combat feels great. But WINNING doesn't feel great, because it's no longer the culmination of anything except mashing buttons. The reason I want a real challenge isn't to prove how skilled I am, it's because a challenge makes you engage with the game more deeply, and so gives you a richer, more sustained experience, which you think about even when you're not playing. Without that, you're left with a nicer-looking but much shallower retread of Monster Hunter World, and that hasn't been worth £60 to me. And even if they redeem it to an extent through title updates and DLC, that won't restore purpose to all these legacy mechanics that now drag behind the game like a dead limb."
190858070,english,0,2246340,"It's a fun game. The combat feels nice. The new monster designs are all awesome, and the game's open world has serious potential.  But the frog has been boiled. What started as ""Quality of Life"" changes in World have slowly morphed the series into something totally different than what I think of when I think of Monster Hunter. So many legacy mechanics feel like they're in the game due to obligation. The Seikret trivializes mid-hunt maintenance, I had basically unlimited Mega Potions, Barrel Bombs, anything I needed, and without the need to gather materials or craft much. No more tracking. Wounding makes Hit-Zones irrelevant. The game does everything in it's power to push you back into combat,  which is also easier than it's ever been and is no longer about thoughtful positioning and commitment. Just sit on your Seikret and let it autopilot you to your destination. I did not fail a single quest my entire play-through. I had fun, but I am sad to see the series give up on it's own identity."

Dragon's Dogma incident repeated. You do not deserve the love from the MH community Capcom. You do not.   After more hours i keep my review negative as people think it would change anything. No. Game looks like ass, runs like ass. Shimmer cause by dlss, frame generation on ground, can't run in native resolution without AI upscalers.

189505316,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is a great game ... just not yet and hopefully with some updates my review might change.  The Good  Let’s start with the positives. Visually, Wilds is stunning. Its environments are beautifully crafted, and the combat remains impeccable, carrying forward the deep, rewarding mechanics that define the series. The thrill of the hunt is still here, with weapons feeling satisfying to use and monsters providing exhilarating challenges.  The fishing is also kinda cool now. (Yes, that’s actually a highlight.)  The Issues  However, despite its strengths, Wilds stumbles in nearly every other aspect. Performance has been unnecessarily poor for many players, and while optimizations will likely come in future patches, they won’t fix the game’s more fundamental problems. Wilds takes multiple steps back from the series' core identity, creating an experience that is frustratingly obstructive and unfinished.  UI and Navigation  The user interface is a mess. Something as simple as adding a friend without joining the same lobby is an ordeal. The game’s multiplayer is somehow more obtuse than World’s already clunky system, requiring unnecessary steps just to play with friends.  The HUD is cluttered with unnecessary markers and information overload, stealing attention from the world and combat. Instead of immersing players, it bombards them with visual noise that detracts from exploration.  Loss of Core Monster Hunter Identity  Monster Hunter has always been about preparation, scouting, tracking, and finally engaging in combat. Wilds strips away these core gameplay elements in favor of shallow, modern open-world tropes.  Scouting is undermined by objective markers that tell you exactly where everything is, removing the joy of discovery.  Tracking is gone, replaced by an ever-present magic marker that directs you to your target without effort.  Exploration is actively discouraged, as the game yanks you back if you stray too far.  Combat, while still strong, is hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of hand-holding.  Rather than enhancing the experience, these changes reduce Monster Hunter to a streamlined action game, stripping away the depth that made past titles special.  Low-Rank Experience and Story  Early-game progression is a slog. Hunts are too short, often lasting only 5-10 minutes, making combat feel rushed rather than rewarding. Build crafting has been oversimplified with restrictive gem slotting, eliminating the creativity and satisfaction of optimizing a setup.  The story, meanwhile, is both forgettable and frustratingly intrusive. Unlike World, which gave players room to breathe, Wilds constantly shackles players with excessive handholding, preventing them from engaging with the game on their own terms. The first 10 hours feel like a prolonged tutorial, suffocating any sense of freedom.  What’s Missing?  Many beloved features from past games are either absent or underwhelming:  No home customization  No endemic life as pets  No meaningful mounts in combat  No significant collectibles  No raids  Cooking lacks variety compared to previous titles  These missing elements further dilute the experience, making the world feel emptier and less engaging.  The Verdict  Monster Hunter Wilds has immense potential. Its combat remains excellent, and its world is breathtaking. However, its misguided design choices, frustrating UI, lack of core Monster Hunter elements, and poor pacing make it a difficult game to recommend at launch. If Capcom can address these issues through updates and expansions, Wilds could eventually become a worthy successor to past titles."
189796037,english,1,2246340,"The game's optimization could use some work. Frame rate drops and occasional stuttering are present even on high-end systems.

Despite the optimization issues, MH Wilds is still a fantastic title and worth checking out."

190185699,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds had a lot to live up to, especially after the success of World and Rise. After spending over 60 hours in the game, I have a lot of thoughts. Some things are fantastic, others are frustrating, and a few are just downright disappointing.  At its core, Wilds is still a Monster Hunter game, which means the thrill of the hunt is there. The weapons feel great, the monsters are well-designed, and the gameplay can be really fun. But… there are some major issues that hold it back. So let’s break it down.  Gameplay - Fun in Its Own Way Monster Hunter Wilds delivers a solid gameplay experience that feels unique and engaging. Despite its flaws, I find myself enjoying the core mechanics, and there’s definitely a lot of potential here.  Weapon Improvements - A Step Forward One of the best things about Wilds is the weapon system. Every weapon feels like a refined and improved version of its Monster Hunter World counterpart. The movesets, mechanics, and overall polish make them incredibly satisfying to use.  Combat - Slow and Clunky Compared to Rise Coming from Monster Hunter Rise, the combat in Wilds feels painfully slow. Rise had a level of fluidity that made the hunts exciting and dynamic, whereas Wilds feels sluggish in comparison. It doesn’t even come close to the sheer fun factor I experienced in Rise.  Multiplayer - No Real Sense of Community Technically, there are plenty of ways to communicate, but the problem is nobody does. The game doesn’t naturally bring players together for multiple hunts; instead, it has this vague ""join a party"" option, which almost nobody uses.  Right now, it's basically: play with real-life friends or hunt alone with randoms who join through the SOS system. There’s no real way to meet new players organically, no sense of community where you can team up for an entire evening, discuss tactics, or just chat about real life. The old hub system encouraged bonding and teamwork—Wilds completely lacks that, and it really hurts the multiplayer experience.  Graphics - Unacceptable for the System Requirements The visuals are an absolute disaster considering how demanding the game is. It feels like a downgrade from Monster Hunter World—everything looks blocky and grainy. At first, I thought it was an issue on my end, but after checking the forums, I realized this is a widespread problem. For a big company like Capcom, this is just unacceptable. My PC is well above the recommended requirements, yet the game still looks underwhelming.  Modding - Almost a Necessity As it stands, mods feel like a requirement to make the game look decent. The fact that the community has to step in and fix visual issues that shouldn’t exist in the first place is frustrating.  Typos in the Config Files?! This one is just baffling. There are actual typos in the config .ini files. It’s a small issue, but it speaks volumes about the lack of polish in some areas.  Final Verdict Despite all its issues, the gameplay itself is REALLY good. But right now, it just barely makes up for the game's many shortcomings. Capcom needs to step up and fix these problems, because as it stands, Wilds is a flawed but enjoyable experience."
189122412,english,1,2246340,"This is my first monster hunter game. I spent about 20 hours in the various beta tests. during my time in the beta tests i went from saying ""i've decided this game isn't for me"" to being one of the ones who stayed up way too late on launch night to finally get to play it again. It took me a bit of time to get accustomed to the controls and figure out how to use my character, but once i had it, it hooked me.  is it a perfect game? no. it has its problems. but for the most part the problems are more nuisances than anything. To be fair, i have a fairly high end PC built in 2019, and i upgraded my graphics card to a 4080 a couple years ago. I haven't had any problems with performance so far. i feel bad for those that are having issues, but my experience has been virtually flawless.  Since this is my first monster hunter i can't really compare it to older monster hunter games. I will say that so far i have enjoyed learning the combat, learning monster patterns and finding new tricks and traps along the way. I have not completed the game, so i have not started into end game, but i don't foresee many problems in end game for my type of play. i don't mind grinding games. i have nearly 700 hours into granblue fantasy relink on PS5 and 200 - 300 in granblue fantasy relink on steam. i enjoy grinding and getting more powerful. so i anticipate the end game will be just fine for me. i will edit my review if that changes.  the couple of problems i have with the game are fairly minor. i get tired of monsters running away. and sometimes running for miles before finally stopping; even when they are near death. it gets so old trying to chase them down as your fully healthy bird can't even catch up with something that is hobbling and stumbling away with broken legs and wounds all over it.  the other problem is with trying to get into a group with friends. the system is beyond complicated. private lobbies are not easy to use and very complex for your friends to try to join. link parties aren't well explained and make no real sense. squads seem to be something akin to guilds. my friend and i are greatly confused every time we try to pair up. joining a lobby with each other often leads to us not being able to see one another. also, even if we are in the same lobby we aren't able to do quests together, you need to be in a link party for that (maybe? since i really don't have a clue) so it's to the point where we join a squad, a lobby, a link party, and then start a quest. for quests in the storyline if you are trying to do the campaign together, you can fight the monsters as a pair, but its janky. when fighting campaign monsters whoever joins the other one gets sent back to the main camp and from there they have to run all the way to the monster to take part in the quest. a monster that is probably half dead by the time you manage to join their quest and load their version of the map and run from camp to the monster; very cumbersome.   i have no doubt that these things will be slowly ironed out over time. it's too bad they weren't solved before launch, but ultimately it doesn't take enough away from the game for me to stop playing it. i am completely enjoying my experience in monster hunter wilds so far and i look forward to putting in many more hours."

I'm running a Ryzen 7600X, 7800 XT, 32 gigs of 6000MT/s ram, and 60fps 1440p native is certainly not locked even WITHOUT ray tracing AND with some performance enhancing changes to the game's configuration file. The high res texture DLC exceeds 16 gigs vram and increases CPU utilization to hit 100% frequently, so I just leave textures at High rather than Very High.  So.... with all this in mind, I'm running the game on an SDR 1080p projector with everything turned up to ultra +rt with FSR nativeAA and having a very smooth, somewhat blurry but still buttery experience.    Performance aside....  +Combat is good +Weapons feel familiar and powerful +Monsters look amazing and intimidating +Doen't feel grindy, repeating missions is fun. The loop is real and never unfun +The core gameplay is simply addicting af +If you came here to kill monsties and wear their remains... this is the game  -THEY GOT RID OF THE CANTEEN! NO MORE PALICO COOKS! WTAF CAPCOM?? -Auto running Seikret mounts are somewhere between convenient and a gameplay sabotaging mechanic (maybe I'm misunderstanding how to control them) -I miss Palamutes, the gathering area, a lot of the home base features from Rise -Story heavy content is not engaging. Discovering lore is not rewarding, dialogue is bloated, and I don't care about this kid or his village. Sorry, not sorry.  -Graphics are meh especially for how much strain they put on hardware -This ditsy blonde smithy works red hot metal in a crop top, and has long ass hair near grinding wheels and large spinning gears like she wants to get scalped with 3rd degree burns, just saying -This game is $70  If you have the best hardware, go for it. If you love MH, go for it. If you are just looking for a new fun game... look elsewhere. It's a good game for those whole know what they are getting into.      +30 hour Update: I've made it all the way to end credits. I repeated a few missions several times. Never got old. It does feel sort of bad to hit end game so soon for a $70, but Monster Hunter always has a ton of end game content that I am looking forward to get into. My system never crashed FYI even tho others report differently. I played exclusively in single player online. Just a few additional thoughts to add.  +Ray tracing performance hit is way less than many other games, in my experience anyway. Typically its a 1-10% fps decrease from off to high on my AMD GPU +Some characters become more likable. I would have appreciated more interaction with Olivia especially +The monsters get so much better in the last half of the game. They were already good, the last handful of fights were super fun  -I do not like the Seikret mounts! Aesthetically, behaviorally, and in gameplay they are inferior to Palamutes -As a long sword and switch axe user.... combat was more dynamic and fun in Rise. Wirebugs had my flying around the screen doing insane combos and damage while staying out of danger -""Mount and strike the monstie"" is inferior to Rise's ""mount and drive the monstie"" mechanic  Sorry for the long exposition. TLDR- Good game. Gameplay good, not best of MH. Needs performance patches. Needs palico cooks."
189274464,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter World is my favorite game of all time, I have over one thousand hours logged on steam. So to say I was excited for Wilds and all the changes is an understatement.   I have just submitted a refund request for Wilds, as even on fully LOW settings with DLSS performance mode my 3070/Ryzen 7 7800x3D/32gb 6000mhz build is not enough to reach a stable 60 fps in what is genuinely the WORST looking game I have played in recent memory. The game looks terrible. Which is honestly not a deal breaker, but it also FEELS terrible. Constant frame drops during hunts and in the village areas make what is already a poor experience an unplayable one. Even switching to FSR and enabling frame gen DOES NOT HELP, as I can peak 90 fps but still chug down to 30 when turning my character around, making the dips even more jarring.   Monster Hunter World looks gorgeous, miles better than Wilds, and runs at a rock solid 120+ fps, no dips, no stutters, no smeary PS2 textures, and no ai upscaling or generated frames.  Elden Ring, a beautiful open world game runs buttery smooth with visuals that put this game to shame.  Sadly both World and Elden Ring had performance issues at launch that had to be addressed through multiple patches, which seems to be the industry standard now. Hopefully the same happens with Wilds, but until then please DO NOT buy this game. Save yourself the time, energy, and money. I spent 2+ hours fiddling with settings and updating drivers for nothing.  I want to love this game, I really do, but in its current state I wouldn't play it even if it was free. Please do better Capcom"
189024025,english,1,2246340,"Aside from the optimization, this game is amazing. Hopefully they release a patch to optimize it so it isn't terrible for people without high end pcs. Runs fine for me, RADEON RX 7700XT and AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, but i can definitely see the bad perf on worse specs."
190519181,english,1,2246340,From the little time I've been playing MH Wilds I can say that i'm having a fun time hunting.  My enjoyment from the game reminds me and is comparable to when i played MH World I love both games but i do have to say that MH Wilds has its issues so i hope the issues get addressed sooner rather than later.   The game has so much potential and I'm excited for future monsters and collabs!!!
188977098,english,0,2246340,"Extremely promising game, but the performance and lack of optimization makes every form of good will garnered from the gameplay obsolete as the frame rate and stuttering is unbareable.   The recommended specs to run this game that the developers had provided is completely inaccurate and more accurately represents the minimum requirements to play the game. The recommended specs would get 30 fps on the best of days. With an i5-14400F, RTX 4060, and 64 GB of RAM this game STRUGGLES to maintain 60 fps and often sits at 45 fps on high settings at 1080p. Even lowering the graphics quality does not consistently improve frame rate."
189619533,english,0,2246340,"I really wanted this game to be good. I built a new PC primarily just to play this, so I won't speak of the performance issues as they didn't affect me at all. And there were also some positive things that stand out. Weapons feel smoother to play than ever, thanks to focus mode allowing to readjust where you are hitting, being able to skip the quest end countdown is something that was finally added as well, etc. But even considering that, there are just too many issues to wholeheartedly recommend the game.  My main grievances are:  1. Hunters have too much control. Thanks to the wound system basically adding a free stagger that any weapon can initiate at will so long as there is a wound makes the monsters look like clowns. Hunting Arkveld, the currently ""toughest"" monster in the game, is more akin to watching slapstick comedy. Between wound breaks, offset attacks, power clashes, flashes, regular topples, and natural traps if you use them, the monster spends more time on the ground or standing still than actively fighting. This also leads to hunts rarely taking longer than 10 minutes, usually averaging 7 at most.  2. Monsters are not dangerous anymore. If a monster does actually manage to break out of a hunters CC chain, it is till no threat. Be it the generally low damage of monster attacks, the lack of blights, wind pressure, and god forbid tremor (a literal landwhale belly flop and we don't get tremored standing next to it?), there's nothing a well timed offset attack of guard doesn't solve.  3. You cannot repeat the coolest fight in the game. [spoiler]You fight Zoh Shia once at the end of LR and that's it? No way to repeat the quest, no optional, no HR variant? We can't wear it's skin or use it's weapons? I'm sure i can hear the designers crying because they didn't get to make a nephilim themed armour with the whole Black and white theme going on in the fight.[/spoiler]  4. The absolute state of skills. I think the idea of taking a new approach to weapon and armour skills is nice. But the execution is severely lacking.  Locking certain weapons into a skill that is just objectively unusable on it is ridiculous (looking at you, crit draw lances).  But even if the skill would be usable, it might just straight up not work because a lot of them are bugged (e.g. Critical Element, Burst for HBG, ...). Locking a weapon into a specific skill is too restrictive either way in my opinion, but that's subjective.  5. The artian system feels very lacklustre. These weapons are the best in the game for the most part. The actual look of the weapons is at best mid though, especially compared to the other weapons in the game which are absolute peak design. And even if artian weapons have different elements, they all look the same. The way you build them as well feels very shallow and not engaging at all. It never makes sense not to go for element, there is no downside to just going 3 of the same element, you can't forgo element for a boost in raw/crit/sharpness or whatever. You always aim for the same thing. And when enhancing, you mostly just hope for a bunch of attack. And if you are unlucky, all you have to do is chuck the weapon into the ether and try again.  6. There is basically no endgame grind. The artian stuff feels like it was chucked on at the end just to have an excuse for an endgame. But in reality, parts are readily available from tempered quests that take no longer than regular hunts. If you are not planning on making a weapon of every type and element, you'll be done in no time at all. Same goes for decorations. It is obvious that the focus of grinding was supposed to be on something different compared to World. This in turn means, that getting all decorations is very quickly done as well, assuming RNGesus doesn't hate you. There is also no new mantles to unlock. You get a grand total of 4 thrown at you during the story and that's it. No doing all optional quests for a new mantle. Nothing.  While writing this review, I realised that some of these decisions may be to make the barrier of entry for new players to the series easier. But I feel like that is no excuse to leave existing fans of the series by the wayside. In World, i really enjoyed struggling with my friends to find a way to beat a certain monster, or a hunt coming down to the wire with 2 unfortunate carts. I enjoyed finding ways to make certain grinds faster with the variety of tools we had at hand. Finding something new to work towards way into the endgame. In Wilds, there's just nothing.  This game left a void in me. I was looking forward to it. I enjoyed playing through the story, albeit it feeling too easy, but I told myself ""Surely it will get harder in HR/Endgame"". And then I get to the end of HR. I beat Arkveld again. I am excited for what is to come when I hit HR50. What fight will be next? Will we get an elder dragon to fight? Zoh Shia again? What are these artian weapons preparing me for? And then ... nothing. I am left sitting in a mountain of unused relics, decorations and artian weapons. Okay, maybe it's HR60 this time around. I check. Nothing. There's nothing else to do. Hunt Arkveld 30 more times to reach HR100 to unlock more melding that I don't even need? That's it. That's the game done.  It may sound like I don't like the game. That couldn't be further from the truth. I still love the game, I see the vision, and I am looking forward to what the game will become in the future. But right now, I just cannot give the game a positive review. I will revisit this review once we see some more content and these issues addressed.  If you've read this far, thank you for tolerating my rambling. I'm done yelling into the void now."
189877669,english,0,2246340,"[h3]Not recommended with its current state (v1.0).[/h3]  It's a good game (not great). My overall rating is 7/10. Wait until Title Update 4~5 first before buying. Some points of the review is in comparsion with the base game World and Rise when they were first released.  First thing I'm gonna say is what I really like about the game. [list]     [*]Focus Mechanic - With Focus Aim you can freely aim anywhere now. This helps a lot especially melee weapons.     [*]Offset Attacks and Power Clashes - Great way of parrying monster attacks and addition to perfect guards.     [*]Slinger Gathering - No need to go the herbs and pick them up.     [*]New way of story progression. Not just: Hub - Post Hub Quest - Hunt. [/list]  With all the stuff below I hope all of them will get fixed and improve in the future updates!  [b]1. Optimization Issues.[/b] Game doesn't use the latest DLSS & DirectStorage versions for better and stable performance. For texture loading problems, it's as stated by one of the modders as well that capcom devs avoided using RAM/VRAM by streaming things when needed from storage instead of at boot time. All of these has been fixed by modders. And I hope Capcom will fix this on their side.  [b]2. Pop-Up Camps.[/b] There are a lot of QoL improvements but there are some changes that are questionable like the pop-up camps. What's the point of pop-up camps getting destroyed if you just need 75 points to fix them? And with the maps that are much larger than previous Monster Hunter games why not just make all the camps available and not have a limit of five. I do like that you can customize the camps now.  [b]3. Bad UX Design.[/b]  [b]First Alma (Quest/Lobby NPC)[/b] Before with the fixed Hub you always know where to go when you want to do a hunt or do something with the lobby. Because the NPC will not move and the NPC will always be there. Right now at least maybe more than half of the time since your Handler is the same as the Hub NPC, with her coming along with you on hunts, She will not always be beside the Base Camp Tent. She will most of the time walk around the Base Camp and you need to go look for her in order for you to interact with her.  [b]There is no bell sound anymore when someone posts a hunt in the lobby.[/b] Right now in order for you to get notified, when someone posted a hunt is through link party. Link party is good I'll be honest even when you are not in the same lobby you can still hunt with other link party members. But when you and your friends are in the same lobby and not in a link party there is no other way to know that someone posted a hunt aside from saying it through VC if you are in a call or manually typing it in game.  [b]Layered Armor/Equipment[/b] Back in MH World when we got Layered Armor you could link your layered armor set with the equipment loadout you are equipping. But now in order for you to change equipment appearance you need to get out of the Change Equipment and Navigate to Equipment Appearance. This is about 10 button presses average if your equipment appearance loadout is in the first page. Also for the Appearance Menu, they should move the Change Appearance below the Equipment Appearance because you will not always change how your character(face) will look. When changing equipment appearance, me and most people I know accidentally pressed this most of the time instead of moving down below first. For listed menu designs you will always put first the ones that will mostly be chosen to the least one.   In MH Rise the Layered Loadouts are in the Equipment Loadouts already. Even though they are not linked you can just switch between Equipment and Layered with LB/RB or L1/R1. They introduced Hunter Loadouts in Title Update 4 in Rise though. This is a loadout with equipment and layered link and an additional link for item loadout. This is really great especially for gunners since they have different ammos for different weapons.  [b]Raising Kinsect[/b] There is no Kinsect Tree. In order for you to know which Kinsect is better is after you nurture all of them. Back in World there are three tabs when you are crafting/updraging equipment and raising a kinsect. These are the list , tree and zoom view. Right now the one for Kinsect is default into a list view only.  [b]No Abandon Quest/No Mantle Reset on each Quest/Investigation[/b] I get that mantles will continue to cooldown when you are doing a Field Survey but when you are doing a specific quest or investigation from Alma the cooldown should reset. This specific review is not for everyone. But mainly who do speedruns or testing some things on a specific quest. The only available option now is ""Return from Quest"" and doing that uses up everything that you did during the quest (i.e. might pill or traps). You need to replenish the items everytime you do the run again. You also need to wait for the mantles to cooldown. Thus making it inefficient to do runs.   [b]No Copy Lobby/Hunter ID[/b] This is a simple feature to add and the Copy Session ID was already present in the Communication menu in World. There was also a shortcut key to view the Player List before in World when view the menu.  [b]Chat Log Notifications and how it disrupts viewing the Map[/b] The game taught us and it has always been the select key to view the map even from the previous game. In Wilds if there are monster notifications in chat, the select key will be the shortcut to skip the monster and to view the map you need to hold the start key. Every UX Designer knows that this is just bad for ""Navigation Familiarity""  [b]4. Story and Progression[/b] We all know that playing Monster Hunter games is always been the never ending hunting of monsters so I am fine with the story being so simple. I like how the story progresses now than before where you post the main story quest in hub and depart on the quest. I think they are moving close to a RPG type of main story progression with the maps connected to each other. And with locked out paths when you are being accompanied by NPC when you guys are riding a Seikret. And speaking of Seikret...  [b]5. Seikret[/b] Seikret AI is kinda junky at the moment. For sure this will be fixed in the future. Palamutes are the best. Change my mind.  [b]6. Endgame Stuff[/b] [table]     [tr]         [th]Game[/th]         [th]Deco[/th] 	[th]Talisman[/th] 	[th]Weapon Aug[/th]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]World[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]Selectable Augments[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Rise[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Selectable Ramp Upgrades, you can ramp up upgrades every weapon not only rampage weapons[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Wilds[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG, you can only reinforce Artian Weapons (Can save scum)[/td]     [/tr] [/table]  Right now base endgame hunting, there is only one monster that is worth hunting with the rewards. And that is mostly Arkveld. For full hunt rewards he will get paired up with a random monster and that is a way for you to hunt a different monster aside from him. Half of my saved investigations are Arkveld since other monsters don't have the same amount of rewards. The other half are those monsters with their Gem as rewards. But if you already crafted a lot of equipments that needs a monster gem. You will just go back to Arkveld.  Back in Base World you could always hunt almost every monster in High Rank since you are looking for Investigations with Gold Rewards and every monster investigation can have that reward. Also why couldn't we fight [spoiler]Zoh Shia again. There's no available investigation you couldn't repeat assigned quests.[/spoiler]  [b]Bounties.[/b] Before you could select bounties (optional subquests in Rise) that you want to do while hunting. And then choose a different bounty when you finish them. Now there is only Limited Bounty and they only reset weekly afaik."
190885605,english,0,2246340,"Never in my mind did I ever think I'd have to, at any point in my life, write a negative review for a monster hunter game. As a disclaimer - I am not a hater. I LOVE the franchise. Started back in Tri, buying the game completely by accident. Just by the art on the cover box, having no idea what I am getting into.  I fell in love with it, despite it's clunkyness and the game doing a poor job of explaining itself, but, by the time I finally fell my first Great Jaggi, I was hooked. The constant gameplay loop of killing a big monster, to make gear out of it, to prepare myself for yet another, even stronger monster - it's a magical code for my brain that keeps me coming back to this series.  BUT... It's not present in this one. Game has amazing fundamentals. The movement never felt this good. The weapon movesets have never been this fluid.  It's just a shame that all of it doesn't really matter, when the core aspect of a ""monster hunter"" game has been streamlined OUT of the game and now it's just a generic ""monster fighter"".  Where as the series started as a ""hunting expierience"" with player having to commit on every step, because there were stakes - now there are no stakes and no commitment. Before, you had to prepare your pouch for the hunt, carefully chosing items and stocking up on them. You had to position well during combat, because if you just go out swinging hands, at best you could whiff an attack and deal no damage, at worst you would get punished by the monster and get hit instead (and remember, your amount of potions on a hunt was limited, so you're being tested my friend).  Now, no matter if im running Dual Blades or Great Sword, as long as I am in range of the monster, it's gonna ALWAYS land, thx to the FOCUS mode, which ironically makes your brain lose focus, kinda zone out and let your hands just go through the motions. Feeling like you're fighting on autopilot, completely disengaged. Add to it the wound mechanic, which lets you stunlock the monster. The Palico that makes sure you don't have to bring healing items ever again and magically lays down a trap exactly at the moment that the monster is capturable. All those little things, and suddenly the game fails to provide any challenge. I could go on and on, but big content creators are finally catching up to what I've been heralding since World came out (because World started the trend, but wasn't nearly as sinful as this is) and they have already said everything.  Mechanics such as wind pressure, tremors, seem to not exist. They probably do but I finished all the content (which is not a lot if you skip all the cutscenes and if you COULD skip all the walkie-talkie sections) and I don't remember wind pressure/tremors or such things happening at all. Now - before you come at me, I did watch all the cutscenes, I didn't skip a single one of them, but my friend wanting to catch up to me, did, and he finished ""the story"" in 7 hours, where as I did so in around 20, and it's never a good sign if 13 hours out of your entire 20 for A GAME are filled with cutscenes.   I keep seeing these claims of the game's director that MH Wilds is a great success because of the story... No my friend. It's a great success despite the story, and mostly because World was a huge success. You are kind of getting the benefit of the doubt here, but you are quickly burning it.  This game has very little to do with what an actual ""Monster Hunter"" series was always about.  Expierience-wise: It's a game about hunting monsters, and as a hunter, preparing traps, tracking, doing what a hunter does. Gameplay-wise: Fight a monster, get it's parts, craft better armor, to be able to fight a bigger monster - that is what we would call ""gameplay loop"" in video game design, sadly, it's non-existant here.  Monster Hunter has lost it's soul and it's an extremly sad thing to witness. Because this used to be one of my most beloved things in the world, alongside Zelda, Mario, Metroid, all these big, passion-filled creations. And now, one of them is getting destroyed.   I might stick around to see Wilds getting it's G-rank expansion, but If the series doesn't change the course to revert some of it's streamlining, this might be the last monster hunter game I ever play."
188928667,english,0,2246340,"I was crashing a TON on a high-end rig, but changed my XMP profile in BIOS to normal, reverting my RAM to its normal speed, and the crashes are almost non-existent now.  Hoping they keep working on fixing performance issues so every hunter, old and new, can have a smooth and fun experience with this game, cus it is REALLY fun. Will change to positive after they address these glaring issues.  I think Wilds improves upon World in almost every way. The combat feels great with the new additions. The music and sound design are spectacular. Monster designs are REALLY cool so far. I don't care too much about the open-world aspect. It's kinda cool, but zones have always been fine. Almost out of low rank and looking forward to more monsters to fight! (pls let me put endemic life on display in a customizable house again PLEASE!!!)

However, it's impossible for me to leave a positive review for this game at its current state.

191400647,english,1,2246340,"[h2]Monster Hunter Wilds[/h2]  I have to say that I personally haven’t had any performance issues with the game. However, I acknowledge that I have a powerful system, and weaker configurations might struggle. Still, I can’t criticize the game for problems that I haven’t experienced myself. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3438993521 Just like with Dragon’s Dogma 2, I’m so happy to see a AAA project that isn’t running on Unreal Engine that I’m willing to forgive some of RE Engine’s quirks, even though it’s clearly not the best for open-world games. It’s a shame that developers like CD Projekt Red decided to abandon their own RED Engine in favor of the more popular Unreal Engine. Cyberpunk 2077 is literally the most beautiful game right now, while Unreal Engine games often look similar to each other. If you play them back to back, it sometimes feels like you’re playing the same game over and over again. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3437765725 As for Monster Hunter, the combat in this game is absolute cinema. There aren’t that many monsters yet, but the developers have clearly focused on quality. The fights feel well-designed and polished. The game itself plays and controls very well. I think they’ll improve performance over the year, and there’s no doubt they’ll deliver more content. Fans have shown massive support by buying a huge number of copies at launch, so Capcom has no excuse not to support the game - unlike Dragon’s Dogma 2 (which, unfortunately, probably won’t be getting any DLC). https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3436312302 The story campaign is fairly short and simple, but it does a good job of introducing newcomers to the game’s overall vibe. However, while they made things easier for newcomers in that regard, the co-op experience (group creation, frequent disconnects, and inconvenient rejoining) could really use some improvements. A more seamless co-op system would be great. Overall, the game is fantastic. The combat is exciting, though maybe a bit easier at launch (some mechanics have been simplified compared to Monster Hunter: World), but it’s still highly addictive!"
191390519,english,1,2246340,"This game feels like a fine dining experience—elegant, delightful, and entertaining, but also pricey and a bit lacking in portion size. Still, with frequent updates and improvements, it could remain fun and engaging for a long time."

With the developer intention of going mainstream the game just become way too easy with so much handholding in the early part of the game to the point that the difficulty is almost nonexistence and while still having an unchallenging endgame, being forced to jump through multiple hoops just to play with friends with the bloated co-op menu, monotonous and confusing map design, seriously i cant even memorized most of the map yet after 100 hours in and after already platinum'ed 200 hours later. make no mistake this is a still good game but seriously need more time in the oven for it to be great. in this current state i would say this game is still a ""premium"" beta. if ur new to the series and wants somewhat of a challenge go for World or if you really want a challenging experience go for Rise instead.

190336674,english,0,2246340,"The game is WILDly underperforming even on high-end hardware. Frankly, I have little to say that hasn't already been said by others. Performance aside...  1. There's a strange pivot away from the ""hunting"" aesthetic in this title. There's no more tracking, monsters are always seen on the map and you can automatically run to them (without any input, really). I can appreciate QoL that speeds up the game a bit, but these are key aspects that are required for proper gameplay pacing and made other Monster Hunter games feel the way they do. 2. The game is lacking some serious gameplay variety through features like the Private Quarters (from World). Because the pacing of hunts is already cranked to an all-time high, having nothing else to do makes the game turn into this boss rush with no meaningful breaks. To me this made it much easier to burn out on this game than on World. 3. I wouldn't expect an endgame given that there is no Master Rank yet, but I do want to point out that the game's existing endgame doesn't offer all that much. It's an upgrade from base World's endgame grind, but that's not saying much given how tedious World's was.  Overall, while it's a good new entry in the series, its problems currently vastly outweigh its strengths and I would recommend players to wait for updates. A lot could be done to address these concerns and I have high hopes that Capcom will listen to the players post-launch to release some much needed changes.  If you're still interested in playing the game, I'd say only buy the game if you're very certain that you can run it properly. The Benchmark tool, according to many, is not an accurate assessment of final performance, so do take it with a grain of salt.   I will change my review once Capcom has committed to addressing aforementioned issues."
188945286,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. World is one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay in this is good, because it's Monster Hunter.  However, if you aren't already a MH fan - I would stay away:  This game looks and runs like absolute dogshit. Actually, worse. It's pretty impressive that this team was able to take such INCREDIBLE assets like the character models, monster designs, and animations - just to take them all out back, smear them in horseshit and weigh them down with stones until they flatten into a miserable experience that is barely playable. With a 4070 and i7 14700kf 32gb of RAM I NEED to use a third party program (shout out Lossless Scaling) to make the game playable on medium settings. It looks HORRIBLE. The textures are muddied over from the (again, necessary) upscaling and everything turns into a ghosting mess. FPS will swing +/- 40 frames when nothing is happening at all.   Making the deliberate choice to use the RE engine for this after the absolutely abysmal fuckup that was Dragons Dogma 2 is fucking astounding to me. The level of disconnect between people who actually played this thing before launch and the reality in which we all live has reached a point that it should be studied by psychologists and philosophers alike as an example of incredible survival within a complete delusion and degredation of the mind. It's an affront to the effot of everyone who worked on rest of the game.   Don't plan on playing this with friends either, the system for joining and creating parties is, once again, a miserable and complicated experience that's buried within layers upon layers of disconnected menus and constantly changing hotkeys, with three different types of ""party"" for you to be in or out of at any time. If you are looking to pull up a friends list, hit ""invite."" and then start playing? Find a game that respects your time in that regard.  I know they still ""got my money,"" and I'm victim to ""I love thing and want thing so I'll play it anyway."" But companies need to stop releasing games like this. I don't think I'll be on board for another one. If you don't love Monster Hunter enough that you'll deal with hating yourself for this purchase because you just NEED IT - DO NOT BUY"
189002814,english,1,2246340,"I am very lucky to have had no performance issues to speak of (on a 3070 nividia + amd ryzen 7 5800H laptop).  Absolute blast early game and the stories been pretty interesting so far, just beat Chapter 1. As always, the quest for drip tops all - and I will be doing Fashion Hunting, as always.  One small issue I have is the story is very rails - the Seikret and game pretends im in control as we go between points, but I am not at all. Would rather the game didnt lie to me rather than have me diagnostics check whether my controller is responding.  As always, dont appreciate the cost of changing character appearance and Palico, but Seikret seems to be free. Game is beautiful without any need for the HD Texture downloadable.  Can you believe it, dynamic weather?! Weather! In my Monster Hunter Game? Weather!!!"

On top of that, the armor and weapons look amazing, making every new set feel exciting to craft and wear.  If I had to nitpick, I’d say the monsters could use a bit more health. Some fights feel like they end too quickly, and I’d love to have longer, more drawn-out battles to really enjoy the depth of the combat.  But honestly? That’s a small complaint in an otherwise fantastic game. Whether you're a longtime fan or brand new to the series, Wilds delivers an unforgettable hunting experience."
188970297,english,0,2246340,Built a new PC for this well above the recommended specs. Getting less than 30 frames in the plains. I know there's a magical game hiding under this wreckage. Capcom needs to dig it out.
188916638,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is the next major instalment in the Monster Hunter series. What Monster Hunter Worlds had, Wilds sadly, just falls short on what World's had. Not completely in a bad way but it is missing the ""good"" stuff about worlds - the end-game. After playing for 30 hours I can now tell you what I think about it!  EDIT: Review is up-to-date as of 18/03/25  Below I will state any issues, my pros and cons but first a quick disclaimer!  [b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b]   [h1][b] Pros[/b][/h1]  ⚫Monster Hunter Rise let you ride around on a palamute, in Monster Hunter Wilds you get to ride around on a Seikret that can GLIDE!?!?!?! I love it!!! ⚫So far, the improvements to weapons are amazing! Got my gunlance ready to be mastered again and now you can carry ANOTHER WEAPON!?!?!?! Now to swap between my bow and Gunlance whenever I want!!! ⚫Cooking has had an overhaul. Now, when you eat food buffs last a set time and they don't go away until the timer runs out, a bonus with this - the timer does not count down when you are in your camp... AMAZING!!! So much smoother now!! ⚫Each area is seamless so far. Full of life and stunning locales. Not only that, each area has weather that changes which adds to land itself. It really makes the land feel alive!! ⚫The monsters look stunning and all of their animations are just... spot on. I cannot tell you how much I love their animations and how amazing they look, especially with the HD texture pack. ⚫You can craft Artisan weapons which are insanely fun to use and to top it off these weapons deal devastating blows to monsters.  [h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1]  ⚫I have seen a lot of people say that the game is ""TO EASY"" - okay, it is much easier. MUCH easier, BUT it's only just out. Give it time. They can always add in Tempered or Arch tempered monsters or heck... a new difficulty bump setting at a later date.  ⚫Charging almost £10 for character edit vouchers is... not right. I am sorry but that's disgusting.  ⚫I have had a few ""performance"" issues here and there. A bit of lag, stutter and occasionally my textures turn to playdough. Another case of ""RELEASE NOW - PATCH LATER"". ⚫The end-game is a disappointment. You are forced to hunt the same 6 monsters over and over again - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna.... making the other 22 monsters completely useless. You will hunt the other 22 about... 1-3 times each and then never have to fight them again. Read about the end-game below!  [h1][b] How the End-Game works [/b][/h1]  So, don't hate me if I got this wrong - You open your map, look for 1 of the 6 TEMPERED monsters you are ONLY allowed to hunt - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna - if one is there, you save it as an investigation and you go do 1 field survey of it, then do the 3 investigations.   If none is there, you go back into your tent, rest (set weather and time to your liking) and then open your map and have a look again. If none is there, repeat. If one is there do the step above.  I am sorry... but this is the worst part of MH: Worlds.   [h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]  Coming from Monster Hunter Worlds and Monster Hunter Rise, Monster Hunter Wilds is definitely a step forward in some aspects but in others... 2 steps backwards, end-game and difficulty being the negatives.  If you are looking for a GOOD end-game, wilds sadly does not offer that, unless you don't mind brainlessly hunting the same 6 monsters for hundreds of hours for that one artisan weapon piece you need.  They have made Monster Hunter Wilds so much more approachable by making it easier for newer players. Do not judge it to harshly just now on that, its only just out, think towards the future for a DLC like Iceborne!!  [h1][b] 7.5/10! Many improvements but a lacklustre end-game makes for a dull experience sadly  [/b][/h1]"
190777174,english,0,2246340,"The game is fine but the challenge has been scraped away and the story is rather not desired. If you're thinking this is worlds 2 then you'll find it isn't.   It's a 70$ base game. It can handle a thumb down review especially since when it'll become ""good"" is when we all pay for a 30-50$ expansion."
188971275,english,0,2246340,Leaving this a Negative Review until they address the performance issues. Game constantly crashes and the frame rate is almost half of what I was able to get with the same settings running the benchmark prior to release.
188977489,english,0,2246340,"As others have started, optimization issues are the death of this game.  Honestly, I'm think the game ran better on the Steam Deck during the OBT than it did on release day.   I love this franchise, while I would love to give it a better score, I cannot experience the game.   A lack of modern hardware isn't an excuse for leaving a game unoptimized. There's no reason why my RTX3090 should be struggling, or for there not to be Steam Deck specific settings to let it run on there.  I will gladly change this review when the issues are resolved."
189974174,english,0,2246340,"Wait a year for the real version of the game to be released.   Also, Artian weapons are hideous."
189114692,english,0,2246340,"I've never returned a Monster Hunter game, but I'm really considering it for this one. Monster Hunter World is my most played game ever, followed by Monster Hunter Rise. I love these games. Even MHW had teething issues when it first released, and it was eventually improved and I was willing to upgrade my hardware to run it better. Wilds doesn't feel that way because:  1. It just doesn't look good. Textures are muddy and often incredibly pixelated. Hair, clothing, tents, wood structures, you name it, all look like a phoned-in effort at best. Once in a while you see a really nice texture, which only makes the rest look worse.  2. Despite the low quality textures and muddy sheen, performance is miserable. For reference, I'm on a 3080, and no matter what I set my options to, I can't break 60 fps. And once monsters come on screen, or any action happens, it's stutter city.  3. I know Capcom is capable of doing better. MHW and MHR both, IMHO, looked better and performed smoother than this one. It hurts to know they can do so much better, but didn't.  4. Co-op play is only ""sorta"" there. I buy these games to play with friends, and the way co-op works, you can't play through the story with them. You ""kinda"" can, but not really. It became frustrating enough that everyone basically said they'd just play through solo and consider multiplay when they all finish the campaign. Not the worse issue. Just an annoying one.  5. A loss of exploration. They touted that it was a big open world, however it's almost pointless to explore anywhere so far. When playing the story, if you wander too far from where they want you to be, they forcefully rotate your camera back around and tell you, ""no."" They don't tell you where to go, just where not to go. Frustrating.  6. Critics have seemingly ignored all of this. I don't why this bothers me so much. I myself am considering holding onto the game just because I love Monster Hunter so much. But the numerous glowing reviews seem very ""off"" to me for all of the aforementioned reasons.  Your mileage may vary. I wish you luck. If you have beefy hardware with all the framegen necessary to smooth out this mess, then all the power to you. I tried using the ""Lossless Scaling"" app to add framegen to my own setup, and it helped substantially. Though it still stuttered in battles, with the game looking worse than any previous Monster Hunter title I've played."
188953758,english,0,2246340,"I very rarely write reviews but i was looking forward to MH: Wilds as it looked closer to the only MH i enjoyed, MH World.  The fact is, the game is in a state that is not playable or acceptable for me at this current price.  3080 + Ryzen 5900x not being able to run the game at steady 60fps with Medium settings and DLSS on Performance is what it's actually WILD....  Will buy the game again when these glaring optimization issues are fixed.  In the current day and age where I can run just as incredible looking games, if not better, at Max Settings with 144fps, this is just simply unacceptable for me at the current state & price."
191947794,english,0,2246340,"[h1] Amazing Game-play, Horrible Performance [/h1]   I love how this game plays, but it doesn't love me back in terms of stuttering, frame drops, and the absurd lengths I have to go to get it to run even semi-smoothly. Despite all my efforts, setting everything to low or off in the settings, I can get maybe 60 FPS if I'm lucky, and the game looks like garbage to boot. The problem is it uses the CPU to render graphics instead of, y'know, the Graphics Processing Unit, so people like me who have a pretty good graphics card are punished for having a cheaper CPU to compensate. It seriously sucks that I can't enjoy a game I've been waiting years for just because I don't have the money for an expensive CPU for just this game. Save your money, wait until they finally do something about this, and if you already bought it, complain like me so we can force them to do something. This is ridiculous."

Performances are not great all around, and you will need need to run Reframework mod if you want not just better perfs but also perfect ultrawide support.  Outside of that I have a few caveats with the game: -Limited number of camps. Why? -Many bugs when it comes to skills. -Skills, as usual, don't tell you the value of what they give you most of the time, which is dumb.  Anyway, buy it, mod it, and enjoy the ride. It's a good game."
188988343,english,0,2246340,"Complain and let them hear you. This game rocks, but the performance feels sloppily done. This can be great, just need the devs to slot in peak performance for the optimization"
189253854,english,0,2246340,"+ loads of QoL changes added compared to world + Voice acting on player character - horrendous performance - lack of end game content - story is a walking simulator - no personal room - have less monster count vs world ( 29 vs 30 ), and there is reuse from world - alpha & beta set is just a color change, not a design variation - blowgun bind recoil to ammo type, and can no longer reduce it through customization  In conclusion this is a half finished product, somehow Capcom have a worse launch than MHRise, In its current state I don't recommend this game"
189012561,english,0,2246340,"Thanks Capcom and Denuvo, I love buying a 70 dollar game and being slapped by Denuvo saying they can't validate it. I don't give a damn I paid for this game and it's already been a nightmare to get this unoptomized mess running!"

189075115,english,0,2246340,"So two things, this game in terms of game-play is impeccable, easily one of the best monster hunters they have ever made if we are talking strictly in terms of how the game plays. However this game runs really, really bad unless you have a supercomputer, horrible FPS and poorly optimized, this game needs a few patches for sure and hopefully Capcom will do them unlike Dragons Dogma 2. Great game on the merit of the game itself, but runs absolutely awful, I think we can say by now the RE engine was not made with games like this in mind."

189110461,english,0,2246340,"Love this game, for me its easily a 9/10 maybe even a 10/10 I have beaten LR and rolled credits and I'm currently making my way through HR. But I cannot, under any circumstances recommend this game to anyone in its current state due to performance and I'm primarily writing this review to add to the discourse in a way that Capcom can respond to and hopefully address.   I am running a 3070ti and Im managing anywhere from 70 - 110 fps on high preset setting with some tweaks, how you might ask? By leaning on AMD's FSR with framegen enabled and dropping my resolution down to 1080p. This works to create a somewhat smooth experience, especially on controller where I feel input lag less, but what it does not create is a beautiful experience. The game is stunning and I say that as someone that thought the game was a washed out mess at first. When they allow it to during different in game 'seasons' colours begin to pop and areas really come to life. Unfortunately due to my settings FSR tends to make textures blurry and muddy, especially at a distance, so until they can fix the absolutely terrible optimisation my game will continue to look like this.  I will update my review if and when fixes come through, the more I look at it, the more I am certain this game was rushed out the door before it was ready. Do not buy this game if you aren't a fan of the series already, wait for the updates and by then there might even be a discount."
189002811,english,1,2246340,"Yes. The game is poorly optimized, who knows why Capcom went with the RE engine making a giant open world game, but it is seriously not that bad if you play on Medium settings. I was trying to play on high and it was terrible after playing for roughly 3 hours before I changed it to Medium. Once I did change it, it worked perfectly fine with no hiccups. Capcom do better, but absolutely stellar game nonetheless.  32GB Ram AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600 NVIDIA 4060ti"
188997656,english,0,2246340,"I'm enjoying it, but the presence of Denuvo means that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the game on anything less than very recent technology (RTX 40 series, Intel 13th gen, etc.)  To be honest, the game is just poorly optimized. I am able to achieve higher than 60 FPS on my own setup without frame generation, but I can still tell something is just not quite right. It runs worse than the betas did, but there's one word that easily explains this.  Denuvo. Denuvo is that word. Why is anyone still using this garbage?  If something changes on this front (I don't expect it will, Capcom is notoriously stubborn on this point) then I may consider changing this review.  Again, I am enjoying the game. But for the purposes of recommending this game to the wider public, I feel the need to leave this red so that people REALLY consider whether this is a worthwhile purchase for them."

189333958,english,1,2246340,"I have played every monster hunter game since Tri at least twice, and I usually play to complete the HR100 or equivalent boss on every save. I also played the older live service games, Monster hunter frontier and Monster hunter online. Here are my thoughts on wilds (HR70/50 hours in game at time of writing):   Positives-  POOGIE IS BACK  Monster hunter wilds is really fun, and anyone familiar with the series will like it a lot. The gameplay loop hasn't changed, and capcom has implemented a ton of quality of life changes that make it more accessible to people who want to hunt more and grind materials less.  The new monsters are all really cool, along with their weapon and armor designs. Capcom does not miss when it comes to aesthetics in these games.  As a veteran hunter, I was worried the combat in this game would not be as enjoyable as previous titles, and while hunts are the easiest they have ever been, the attacks and animations in this game FEEL SO GOOD you basically don't notice. I have not used seikret or mantels during combat to make it more challenging, and used un-upgraded starting armor through LR6, but throughout the whole story (both low and high rank) I only carted [died] about 3 times, and did not fail a single quest. I was planning on avoiding using focus mode and exploiting wounds as well, but honestly they are so fun and satisfying to use I would sacrifice the difficulty for the satisfaction. Despite the lack of difficulty, the gameplay loop and game feel is worth 70$ to me personally.  The story in this game is... an improvement from previous entries. The characters, cutscenes, and storyline are more involved and compelling than previous installments, but to be honest, I don't think many people are playing monster hunter for a compelling story. unga bunga hammer go bonk, and all that  Overall, the game feel is impeccable, and I will probably end up putting at least a couple hundred hours into it before its G/Master rank expansion releases in a couple years. Capcom has already promised half a dozen or more free title updates over the next year that will include new monsters and loads of event quests and other things to do in the game. For me at least, the $70 is worth it to satiate my addiction to this series.   Negatives-  Performance is really bad. I have a Ryzen 9 5950x and a 3090 and I am playing this game at 4k high, raytracing off and getting 45FPS. This is playable for me because I spent a decade playing on a 3ds outdoors at 20 fps, but understandably many people are not willing to play a 70$ game below 60fps or able to afford a PC capable of more than 30fps.  On top of the low framerates, graphical bugs are not uncommon either. I personally have experienced the ""black triangle"" 3 or 4 times in my 45 hours of gameplay, which causes a flashing black triangle to fill about a quarter of your screen for 20 seconds or so for no apparent reason, which makes the game almost unplayable while its happening. I have also seen the ""PS2 graphics"" bug, where some models appear to have about 100 polygons like OG Final Fantasy 7. For me this happened once after fast travelling and it resolved itself after about 3 seconds. I personally have not experienced any game crashes (I'm on the latest version of Windows 11 with the latest graphics drivers).  In classic capcom fashion, the menus in this game are heinous.  in particular, setting up multiplayer is particularly problematic until you figure out the system, so I will explain what you need to do to get it working the way you expect it too:  Basically, you want to have your friends in a lobby AND a link party at the same time. The lobby is basically how you can see your friends in the overworld, while a link party allows you to go on quests together as a group. you can go on quests together using either one, but for the best experience, you want both. To set it up: 1. you want one person to create a private lobby after selecting their save data on the home screen. 2. after loading in to the game, that player should get the lobby ID by going to the member list screen (start -> tab 4, labelled ""communication"" -> member list). The lobby ID will be displayed on the right. This player should send that lobby ID to everyone they want to play with. 3. The other players should select ""lobby search"" and then ""find a lobby based on ID"". (finding from in game or steam friends lists seems to have a 30% or less success rate, lobby ID works every time in my experience). 4. After loading in to the lobby, one player should go back to the member list mentioned before, and go to the ""lobby"" tab, then select and invite the other players to a link party. 5. The other players then need to accept the link party invite, either by holding the plus button on their controller after they receive the notification, or by going to start -> communication -> invites -> received invites.  From here, players will be able to see eachother in the overworld (because they are in the same lobby) and will automatically be able to join quests the other players post (because of the link party). Keep in mind a private lobby can have 16 players but a link party is only 4, so your lobby can have 4 groups of 4. You can also join quests from outside a link party by talking to Alma, so you can do quests with anyone else in the lobby, its just less convenient. You can have a link party between players in different lobbies and a lobby with no link parties, but you probably want both.  lastly, I personally found the music to be a little underwhelming compared to previous entries.  None of the negatives are severe enough to be a deal breaker to me, especially since most of them will (hopefully) be patched out.  EDIT:  After thinking about it a while last night, I realized that what really sets the old world games (everything before Monster hunter world) apart from the more recent ones is the feeling that you are really in an intense fight with a monster. I cant really put my finger on what makes that difference, but it has something to do with the players ability to move more freely in current games.  Old world games required a lot more intentionality and commitment to attacks because a poorly timed or spaced attack could cost a cart. I feel like I can get through basically any hunt in Wilds by mashing buttons on my controller while wielding a sword and shield, but I do look WAY cooler doing it in wilds than in any other game.  Part of what I enjoy about monster hunter is the community aspect. Joining a random quest to get materials you need and finding people spamming stickers and gestures and having fun in post game is as relevant as the combat itself to me. Those kinds of interactions aren't as accessible in old world games as they used to be (albiet not impossible to find).  I'm playing with 2 different groups of friends so I am having fun helping them progress through the game while using my own time to do fashion hunting and grind materials for melding armor spheres and artian upgrades. Capcom added event quests and more weekly challenges today. Even if I don't enjoy this game the same way I did old world games, I am still having a lot of fun playing it and it still feels like there is enough for me to do (although I wish there was more).  While it doesn't impact my review of this game at all, I would encourage anyone that enjoys wilds as their first monster hunter to play an old world game like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.   Update as of HR100/~60 hours in game: I was at steam review character limit so I put it on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7acuo/"
190034181,english,1,2246340,"After 60 hours, hunting every monster, and hitting HR 75, I think I can say this is a good entry into the Monster Hunter franchise.   The elephant in the room is of course being the performance and technical state of the game. Quite frankly, this launch is unacceptable. There's no reason for my new rig with a 4070ti and a Ryzen 5 7600x should be struggling to hit 60fps at 1080p. It seems like they really want you to use frame generation on your first bootup as a magic bandaid, but that's not how this works. Bad performance is bad performance. This alone would normally get me to give it a negative review.  But dammit, this game is so fun. It's all I've been thinking about lately. In terms of the core gameplay, this is the best monster hunter has ever been. Everything feels good to use, every weapon is fun, every fight is cinematic, and every monster is diverse, and in my opinion, more interesting than the monsters in base world.  That being said, it's not all fantastic. The other elephant in the room is the difficulty of the game, which has been a hot topic, and has been since World even. This was my experience: I played most of the game solo or with a buddy, and I honestly didn't see much issue with the difficulty. I'm not a Monster Hunter expert, but I'm not a beginner either, so I expected low rank to be a pushover and it was, no problem with that. High rank saw a boost in difficulty, primarily with the Apex Predators, that I was happy with. Not too hard (which will come in master rank I'm sure) but not brain dead. I rarely carted throughout the game, but I also played previous Monster Hunters and still had to actually fight. From my memory this is about the experience I had in World as well.   But then I decided to play some 4-player SOS missions, and the dynamic changed entirely. Most monsters rarely attacked since they were constantly getting hammered, wounded, and stunned, including late monsters. World wasn't entirely difficult either, but this slaughter wasn't as common place even with 4 other players. It feels like the game was balanced for solo and duo play and not much else, the monster health is super low and the wound status rate is too high, which just creates scenarios where 4 players wail on the monster creating perpetual wounds. A big appeal of Monster Hunter is the multiplayer, which makes this a bit of a disappointment. Teaming up in Monster Hunter usually always makes it easier, but it really shouldn't be this much of a leap to where hunts end almost as soon as you reach the monster. This WASN'T the case in World, I still felt like 4-player hunts were fun in that game even if it was a tad easier.   In general, multiplayer is the weak point of this. Needlessly complicated to even get into a game, in some cases even a downgrade from prior games in terms of accessibility. I don't see the reason for the distinction between Lobbies, Link Groups, and Environment Links. It just seems overly complicated and poorly explained. And of course, the famous communication error makes a grand return.  Arena missions are missing as well, which is unfortunate. Some of my favorite memories of previous Monster Hunter games were teaming with a friend to get the best time with the pre-selected gear setups, but that aspect of the game is gone. Hopefully it makes a return in a future title update or in the Master Rank expansion. (EDIT: Confirmed for title update 1!!)  And then there's some general gameplay changes, i.e. the Seikret mount, no monster tracking, easy escapes and heals. To be fair, most of these were introduced in Rise and were just brought back to this, but generally I don't think they were needed and likelycontribute to the lack of challenge veterans are experiencing. Hunters and Palicoes have more tools now than ever before, but the monsters haven't been buffed to match (yet) and it's starting to show the divide. Again, low and high rank are all that's available, so I can't say whether this is necessarily good or bad yet, but I can't deny some of the Monster Hunter identity seems to be lost. Tracking and searching may have been shallow, boring, and frustrating in the other entries, but it was a part of the charm of actually hunting the monster. You could argue with that gone you can get right to the good bit, which is the fights, but then it just ends up feeling like a boss rush game and less like a hunt, especially when ""prep-time"" feels like more of an afterthought now more than ever.   That being said, I have still thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game (and not done yet!) and think it's still some of the best gameplay the series has to offer, which at the end of the day is what draws me in. This is the perfect starting point for a new hunter and has a lot to offer. Just keep in mind Monster Hunter is famous for confusing progression and menus, and just have fun with it without getting bogged down too much. Looking forward to crown hunting (yes I'm crazy), updates, and Master Rank!"
189066635,english,1,2246340,"Guys, I like the gameplay and all, but could you add more menus to the game? I feel like there are not enough menus in the game. I would like at least 2x more menus for each interaction. Also, I think 2-3 types of party aren't enough to play with a friend. We need at least 5-6 types. Maybe with 2-3 menus each. Also, could you add 2-3 submenus in the main-menu?"
190904134,english,1,2246340,"To say I've put in quite a few hours over the past few weeks would be an understatement, so obviously I had a good time. If I take away some of my bias, it barely passes the recommended line though, and definitely with some caveats.  [h3]Caveat 1: Optimization[/h3] Let's start with the elephant in the room. The game runs worse than QWOP. You need a top of the line rig and preferably 2 to 3 mods in order to ensure it runs smooth enough on higher graphic settings. If you own a more affordable PC, there are about 10 different optimization guides and a reddit megathreat to help you out with making the game playable.  If that's not your cup of tea, don't buy the game until they fix this premium priced mess.  [h3]Caveat 2: Difficulty[/h3] I started with Monster Hunter Rise, and it was the same story back then. The new mechanic made the game too easy. Now I hear similar arguments about Seikrets making the game too easy.  I think a lot of people understate the fact that escape mechanics are relatively trivial in the long run. When I started in Rise, I needed that escape to succeed quests. As I got more experienced at hunting monsters, it started to feel like an easy escape button. After hundreds of hours the ability became trivial since I had mastered my dodges and evades.  When I started in Wilds, I very rarely used my Seikret escape button. It's because I came in with thousands of hours of experience. Experience that translates to this game, because at its core it's still a Monster Hunter game. As the title updates and eventually master rank will arrive, we will see a bump in difficulty, until we min-maxed those end game builds. Then everyone will be complaining again that it's too easy.  I don't think the same applies to new players though, or the ones that play every now and then. Monster Hunter in general is very overwhelming if it's your first entry into the series, and I believe Wilds strikes a good balance between difficulty, survivability and most importantly...fun. There is very little that stops you from playing the game. There is almost always something you can do through skills, items or abilities.  In other words, if you are a veteran looking for a difficult Monster Hunter game, I can't recommend this one. If you are new to series, and have a NASA PC at home, and are willing to install mods, I can recommend this game.  [h3]Caveat 3: Purpose of Monster Hunter[/h3] I hear a lot of complaints about how the series is turning away from its original purpose. I can't account for that myself because this is my second Monster Hunter game. What I can account for is my own reason for why I boot up the game. It's to hunt monsters. And in my opinion, that's the most important part of a Monster Hunter game.  Hunts may or may not last shorter. Tools may or may not be unlocked quicker. I don't know. What I do know, is that the fights are amazing. In between the 10 million stutters, frame freezes and disconnects of course. Whether that's 4 veterans absolutely destroying a monster, or just you, your weapon and your skills. There is also a good variety of monsters, given that this is only the starting roster.  In order to get to the fun part you do need to put in some hours though. Monster Hunter is notorious for feeling clunky at first. There is a flow which most people only start to appreciate after they have spend a substantial amount of time with the combat mechanics. Once you have found the weapon that fits with your flow, hunts starts to feel like dances with the monsters, and it feels great. That's why I keep playing.  If you're down for that, then I can recommend this game. Again, provided you have a NASA PC at home and a Nexus account for some optimization mods. If you are looking for elaborate preparation rituals and a deep understanding of the game in order to beat monsters, then this is not the game for you.  [h3]Caveat 4: Multiplayer[/h3] If you want to play with friends, there are lobbies, squads, link parties, hunter friends and two different voice chat channels. It's a confusing mess. Once you know where to look it's quite simple of course, but you need a 5 step guide to help you do this for the first time.  If you are more of a solo player, you can't cue up for SOS quests. Instead the game shows you a list of all the SOS quests that are ''available.'' You have to manually click on one, request to join, wait, click away a message that says you can't join the session, click away another message that says you can't join the quest, back out of the quest menu, select another quest from the list, and repeat the process. Just host your own quests, it's much better for your mental health.  [h3]Story and Music[/h3] Lastly I want to touch on 2 more points. The story is alright. It actually ties into the locales you visit and the monsters you hunt. It also has some cool lore bits if you are into that. But it's nothing to write home about. The monster themes on the other hand are absolute bangers.  [h3]In Conclusion[/h3] If you want to have some fun hunting monsters with or without others, then I can recommend this game. It has a good starting roster of monsters and there is more to come. The combat will take some time to get used to, but after that there is a lot of fun to be had if you ask me. Even when you got fights down to a science. Aside from the actual fights, it has little else going for it. Hopefully, for now.  However, the game is optimized so badly that I can only recommend it in good faith if you have a very solid PC. If that's not the case, I would wait until they have rolled out enough patches to at least make the optimization mods obsolete.  [i]Edits: spotted some grammar mistakes.[/i]"
189304061,english,1,2246340,"Incredible Game. After 60 and just hitting HR 100 I can say that - while I think the basegame DOES lack a bit of content compared to the release of the other Titles I played:  - Investigations are insanely fun - Farming for Items be it Armor or Decos is incredibly fun and feels like a rewarding loop that didnt get stale for me so far - Outside of 2 Figths every Monster in this Game on release for me is a good and fun one.   THE PC PORT HOWEVER LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED. Lots of graphical issues and the game crashes for me at least like once a day. To however complains about the difficulty: Yes the Game isnt that hard, but its fights are fun and imo thats what matters way more"
189158919,english,0,2246340,"Cool game, awful performance and worse optimisation. Capcom, if you do end up fixing the game and you'd like me to edit this review into a positive one it will cost you £3.49 for a ""Review edit voucher""."
188928780,english,0,2246340,"Ok, I'll say this Capcom. I love your games, I even loved this game so far, it has a lot of incredible stuff in it. I can see why people are giving it 8/10, 9/10, even 10/10. I'm even able to play it at a comfortable stable framerate with good visuals, because thankfully I'm blessed with quite a decent setup. But WHAT THE HELL is this lack of optimization and you trying to force Framegen on us? Not everyone is even able to use this tech. I saw how the game runs and looks on consoles, also not the best situation there.   You'd think that the whole situation with Dragon's Dogma 2 would change smth for the better, and instead we have this.   As of now, unless you have a beefy PC or an absolute MH fan, who'd play this game at a low locked framerate with possible sacrifices in terms of visuals, do NOT buy this game. Wait for a sale, better optimization, or whenever you have an amazing rig. This is the worst AAA product in terms of it's technical state that I've seen in a LONG time man."

I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point.  I am by no means saying the game is bad, but in its current state, you should probably consider waiting for a more stable release."
190708376,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter has been my favorite franchise for a long time, and I am very excited for the new generation of Monster Hunter.   My first impression after 20 hours of game time, I feel like there are a lot of aspects that have been simplified.   There are no more hunting monster tracks. You just get on your mount, and it will carry you to your target automatically.  Another aspects I like in Monster Hunter is how important preparation is, but in Wild, that doesn't realy matter. You forgot to bring a warming potion, oh don't worry, the game has you covered.   I could write a lot of paragraphs complaining about how much easier this game is compared to its predecessor, but maybe people are tired of it.    However after 80 hours. I finally realized that Wild is a better game for me, at least now, since I don't have much time to play games anymore, let alone having to hunt one monster for up to 60 minutes.  I hope that with so many QOL's that make hunting easier, Capcom can balance it by providing new, more challenging monsters."
190363900,english,0,2246340,"This is being written before any of the game's major updates, about three weeks after launch. And it's being written by an insane old lady who started playing this franchise on her Playstation 2 in 2005, who cares about it more than she ought to. I also had a lot of fun in my 50 hours so far. Hitting 'no' on whether I recommend it isn't really a literal 'I do not recommend the game'. It also has nothing to do with the extremely valid criticisms of the game's extremely dogwater performance. Keep all that in mind.  I don't think my take on Wilds is going to be a popular one, even with as many critics as it's building up. Which is fine, I'm used to that, World is the first time I've actually agreed with majority consensus on this franchise, while before that I would have still insisted Unite was the best in the series. That isn't a popular take. But I really can't help but feel like Wilds has gone in a bad direction for the long-term health of the series. Not because of the shorter hunts or the 'lack of content' that you may have already heard complaints about, especially that latter one. I DO think there's some truth to it, I think even at launch World had a lot more to do, but zero question that perception is mostly from people remembering World in its final state.  My issue is that this game feels completely frictionless. The game doesn't feel like it ever stops me, it doesn't feel like it ever trips me up. Everything is so easy to do, not just the fights but supplies and food and inventories and unlocks and layered gear and, just everything. Your mount automatically sends you to where you need to go and everything you'd ever need is put in your pocket then the big monster dies after tapping you on the wrist a couple times and that's that. Even that example I gave before, there's just as many palico gadgets and we obviously still have a mount, but you just kinda. Get them. I didn't have to explore some weirdo unmarked nook of the map to do a weirdo unmarked quest for some random unmarked cats, I just kinda got it. Everything is laid out for you, handed to you.  There's good and bad to the friction being gone. I love that sharpening is actually possible to do mid-fight solo now, but I feel like it's too generous that my seikret can just pick me up to bail me out of anything at all ever. I'm not going to miss Nergigante's 'roar which stuns you for long enough that you don't have time to sheathe your weapon to superman dive away from his now undodgeable attack' garbage, but I'm not sure I like that trade if it means NOTHING feels threatening. Nobody liked the old deco drop rates but... I dunno, it feels a little hollow finishing my build 50 hours into the game. Half of this stuff wouldn't be bad on its own, and half of it is actively good, but all at once? Remove ALL the friction, good and bad, at once? It makes it feel aimless, insubstantial, braindead. The game is so devoid of ANY sort of friction that I'm sitting over here feeling nostalgic about paintballs and mid-fight combining, for gods sake. Those were NOT good mechanics, but in a room full of padded walls I'm craving something concrete, something with some weight to it.  I think my biggest gripe - and I KNOW this take is going to be super unpopular - is focus mode. I just don't think I should be able to throw out attacks nonstop without thinking about them and relying on focus mode's 180s to trivialize positioning. To me, the essence of monhun is the need for commitment, for planning, the fact that having to consider so many things regarding monsters and your own movement and positioning in advance not only necessitated deeply learning monsters' behaviours, but rewarded you massively for it. Landing a TCS on a mobile monster used to be a thing of mastery and beauty and now it's just... Nothing.  The game honestly kinda feels more adjacent to Helldivers than World. A party game that exists purely for small groups of friends to roll loot slot machines in. And don't get me wrong, I like those kind of games, but that's not what monhun was to me.  Regardless of whether future monsters do more damage and take longer to kill, that won't change the fact that focus mode makes positioning nearly redundant, that every single weapon has get-out-of-jail-free moves, that the big moves just aren't hard to pull off anymore given they're either twice as fast or have super armour or both and even if you do screw it up completely you can roll out of it before it's even gone off, that your seikret ensures it's nearly impossible to get combo'd out, that the absolute worst the game can do is put up a Quest Failed screen and take away the 5 mega potions you used on the fight from your stash of 800.  I said at the start of this that I don't necessarily not recommend the game. But, at present, I would definitely recommend you to play World first. Too many edges got sanded down, I think. It's lacking the franchise's usual weirdness, and its abrasiveness. You can give the upcoming update monsters 10 times more HP, but it won't bring back the feeling of satisfaction that overcoming those rough edges brought.  In retrospect Monster Hunter Wilds is a very ironic name for something that feels so completely toothless.  EDIT: I did not expect so much attention on this, let alone for it to all be positive. Thanks for that! Especially the people sharing their old hunting stories, so, lemme share one of my own nostalgic hunting stories as thanks.  I still hadn't 'got' monhun when Unite came out, despite playing 1, 2 and F2. Nargacuga was the flagship monster for that game and I really liked (and still like) its design. I got the quest to hunt it, suited up with my trusty old Akantor armour, and decided on dual blades for it. One of my weaker weapons but it felt appropriate. And, like, what's the worst that could happen? I wasn't even in G Rank yet.  I drastically underestimated how tough a fight it would be, and wasn't nearly good enough with DB for it. I carted twice quickly just from being blindsided. I played safer from then but was still getting knocked around.  I went through my entire potion supply. I kept fighting but got low on HP and ran off to actually use the tent to heal (a lot of people didn't even know you could do that in the older games lmao), and do some old fashioned on-field procurement of potion materials, despite being unfamiliar with the new map. I hadn't had to do that since monhun 1. I thought about going home for the hammer but despite the struggle I was just... having fun. It really did feel like I'd just met something that was my match and I had to knuckle down and learn it.  I somehow managed to keep surviving, but the timer was becoming an issue. I'd barely even remembered quests had a time limit. I basically had no hopes for finishing it off, I was just keeping up the fight as practice. But I kept swinging when I could. Past 45 minutes I stopped going off to gather even when I fell into fatal range. And with literally less than a minute on the clock, it died. Out of almost all my supplies, battered and broken, hanging onto my last life by a thread, but I managed it.  It's still my favourite monster hunter memory. As Wilds is, it's really hard to imagine it making a story, and a feeling, like this. World gave me some similar ones with some of the nastier monsters. Most of those memories were from Iceborne, though, so I do still think there's hope for Wilds to turn out some great moments with AT patches or the inevitable expansion, but like I say in the review, patches can up the numbers but they can't make Helmsplitter satisfying again.  But also like I said in the review, I didn't really like the games between Unite and World much. It's not the end of the world if Wilds still winds up mid after everything. I waited 9 years between monhuns I actually liked before and I can do it again.  Happy hunting, y'all."
191600679,english,0,2246340,"Optimized mess. Modern games need to stop using new PC parts as an excuse, there are games that look 5x as better as this that released years ago and run on older computers completely fine."
191935978,english,0,2246340,"Too hard. Too many Apex monsters use a new attack called ""GENERATE CRASH REPORT"" that can't be dodged and can't be blocked. And ends hunt, bypassing all carts.  Would be a great game once this attack is nerfed."
189006148,english,0,2246340,"Ignoring the glaring performance and networking issues, I don't understand how you managed to make the multiplayer so bad after publishing Rise.   When the multiplayer works, it has the same problems as World, like needing to start quests solo, find the objective, watch a cutscene, exit the quest, and join a friend to actually play the game together.  Why? You already had a good system in Rise. If you're going to do sequences and cutscenes, let me at least bring a friend along.  Also, link groups are a stupid mechanic. Why is progression not tied to the lobby?   For the brief minutes where I do manage to fight the monster with friends, it's a really fun experience. This game may very well have the best combat in the series. I genuinely don't know why you designed the multiplayer this way.  Edit: A lot of you mentioned playing from a squad lobby, and it did make joining after the cutscene much more bearable, but I still don't like the game's singleplayer oriented design for the story quests, especially when Rise and GU story quests both work flawlessly with multiplayer. (Haven't played the older games yet)  Happy to report that non-story missions work with multiplayer almost flawlessly in Wilds. I'm hoping once my group reaches high-rank things will open up a bit more."
192286286,english,1,2246340,"Disclaimer: I played a ton of Monster Hunter so my thoughts come from that position. I'm not a 'purist' who outright dismisses modern MonHun, there's design decisions I have problems with but my focus is mostly on the product. I'm mostly comparing Wilds to World considering these are ""A team"" games (stuff like rise/sunbreak is the B team).  4 key points: Content, Performance, Story, Gameplay.  Content Is always iffy on new Monster Hunter releases. The games are being treated like Pokemon, with an eventual big update dlc/expansion basically making the game feel complete. This is one of the more unfinished feeling experiences I've had with Monster Hunter. I don't say this just from the wealth of Monsters to fight, Tri probably had less, but there's a lot of gaps particularily in the endgame. The fact that the open beta had you fight the de-facto final boss of the game is mad to me. I genuinely had my final boss fight before the game released, it was way harder too which was super satisfying once I beat it. The game is also pushing stuff that feels like it should be basegame into content updates. The first big content update is huge but it also definitely should have been there in the first place.   Performance sucks. The game took 0 lessons from World (And the A team worked on this prior). There's just no two ways about it. You can watch someones youtube footage on a 5090 and they still get texture pop-in. World had massive performance issues at launch and the ones here feel especially eggregious considering World probably is a better looking game too. Try the benchmark.  Story I'm only mentioning because of how forced it is. They definitely wanted to focus on it more this time around but the problem is that it's just not good. It's painfully formulaic and the twist in the middle actually made me laugh out loud with how silly it is. My multiplayer experience with friends was hampered multiple times by one of us having to go through a forced walk-and-talk that you cannot skip. I don't think a strong story would not work in a monster hunter, quite the opposite, but it's definitely not exploring anything interesting with the setting.  Your character this time is fully voiced and also a total badass during cutscenes right from the get-go. Very hard to immerse yourself that way. I cannot understate how egregious it is that your character is being treated like a newgame+++ gigachad from minute 1. Usually monster hunter treats your guy fresh meat straight outta the academy, and you earn your badass status by working your way through challenges. Nata (the kid) gets introduced as the surrogate protagonist because you need a character who is even remotely vulnerable to have some stakes. The confrontation with the final boss may as well have had linkin park playing with how badass/edgy the setup was.  Gameplay. Lotta things I could talk about here. There's plenty of smaller nitpicks between a really awkward multiplayer lobby system and questionable weapon balance, but if I had to summarize the biggest issue with Wilds it would be something like this: This is the Monster Hunter game where they want you to feel like a badass. Hunter movesets are far too powerful, Monsters did not compensate enough for this. You are consistently overpowering monsters at every stage of the game. As others have pointed out before, the game feels like you are beating low-rank monsters with high-rank gear. Hunter movesets were made to be a lot more mobile which is definitely fun, but it also means that positioning matters less. Why reposition for a big attack when you can just press the parry/counter that is completely reaction based, on a very very easy reaction no less. Parries definitely do not come at a premium in this one. A lot of talk was made about how the Seikret was an improvement over the wirebug from rise, but I think people underestimate how powerful the Seikret is. The game doesn't outright say this but you can get knocked down and still call your bird, completely saving you with plenty of invulnerability, making it functionally impossible to die given how calling it is free. This is by far the easiest monster hunter.  My guess is this is also why the Story treats you like a badass from the get-go. I think this is a deliberate decision by the devs. This is the game about the power fantasy of being a monster hunter, but it feels unearned if the challenges aren't really there (or your character does something badass in a cutscene).  The content and difficulty in this game are intertwined. The grind in Monster Hunter primarily functions as the endgame and replayability, giving you goals to do micro-optimizations to your gear, try different weapon loadouts, etc. Problem is they hand you everything way too quickly. An armorset can be completed in 2 hunts. Jewels you basically get shoved down your throat (and I didn't even do the farming exploit that was meta for a while). And why grind anyway if I'm already demolishing monsters. I don't really feel the improvements to my gear when fights are easy and they are still easy with better gear. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of the series, I'm not expecting to get challenged the same way here as I am with late-stage content of older games. But this is the only monster hunter where I just feel ""done"" with the game. I've seen it all.  The future for this game is a little iffy. They clearly shipped the game too early and are introducing more stuff with their scheduled content updates. I'm not certain they will fix core issues with the game however. They talk about looking into balancing and I certainly hope their 'careful language' there will bring the overall powerlevel of hunters down, but I doubt it.  I'm probably coming back to it once the big ""rise2"" expansion releases, but until then, as I said, I've seen it all. I would still recommend this game as an entrypoint for newcomers if you have the PC hardware to properly run it. It's still monster hunter. It's still fun with friends and all. But after finishing wilds we went back to revisit sunbreak and had a much better time overall."
189035851,english,0,2246340,"Thank you Denuvo for locking me out of my own game trying to troubleshoot its poor launch optimization and play it on the one computer i own. I appreciate it!

You really saved me there--I don't know what i would do if were able to play with my friends for the one game we have all been excited about for half a year. You know what? You're right I don't need friends anyway. Hopefully they will all get locked out too.

189044441,english,0,2246340,"[h1][b]Here's the most relevant reasons the game feels so bad until high-rank:[/b][/h1]  [b]1. Performance, and fidelity.[/b] Reasonable framerates on everything but the latest GPUs come at the cost of textures that look straight out of a ps2 game half the time. Why do my scoutflies look like minecraft particle effects when I'm not 2 inches from them? Why does having more than 2 entities on screen, or rotating my camera at all, cause stuttering? The difference in quality between this and other recent AAA titles is staggering. Wilds has such good designs and animations, which get severely neutered by the absolutely broken performance.  [b]2. Multiplayer cohesion.[/b] It is miserable to have to re-join a quest, only after someone has actively started the hunting portion of the quest, when you have played along the exact same questline. Not only that, even if you're playing in tandem, you have to ACTIVELY run away from the hunt you're trying to complete together in order to even re-join your friends, since the game gives you a connection error if you get hit by the monster you were immediately forced to fight. It's crazy that they managed to un-fix a problem I thought they'd resolved in other titles.  [b]3. Pacing.[/b] Good lord, it's miserable. Are you going to get a cutscene that forces you to leave the area immediately after a quest? Or maybe a dialogue sequence you have to skip through one message at a time? Or an unskippable auto-walk at the slowest possible movement rate on your seikret? After 2-4 of these, randomly chosen, you will be immediately thrust into a hunt that lasts all of 5 minutes. Repeat until the credits roll.  [b]4.  Difficulty.[/b] Worlds and Rise both had significantly harder monsters than anything in Wilds. They have tiny health pools that make it so you barely engage a monster before it's dead. Their attacks do negligable damage that is healed with 1 potion (or better yet by your palico which you no longer have any choices to make regarding their tools), and there's no threatening follow-ups to the monster attacks on the off-chance they even get you low enough to care. Wounds spawn constantly, and borderline stunlock monsters when you proc them. I never, ever felt anything that could qualify as a challenge, not even on the final boss, and so I felt like I had to rush the game to even have a chance at enjoying any gameplay, because HOPEFULLY high-rank is a little less trivial.  [b]5. Exploration.[/b] There is literally no reason to do any exploring, at all, ever. The closest you could get to an incentive would be for pop-up camp locations. Your seikret transports you to all but two destinations automatically, and the entire map and all of it's resources are revealed. There's no gameplay-driven reason to hunt for anything, and it is so sad because the artists put tremendous work into the scope and detail of the world, and the monsters, and the environments, and it all gets wasted because you're never made to gather monster tracks, or do an expedition, or hunt for gathering spots.  When you combine all of these factors, you get a game that feels like it's trying to say [b]""Hey, actually, please don't engage with me until the postgame, because every single system I'm built on is working together to make the process of getting there nothing but a chore.""[/b] It's insane how many systems they discarded that validated the entire experience of Monster Hunter. God, I hope high-rank has some challenge to it at least. It's unforgiveable how badly they designed this game in totality. Bless the artists, and the combat designers, but every director in charge of the rest of the game should be ashamed of the experience they've provided us."

It was fine in the 1st beta, but since the 2nd beta it has been causing crashes, freezes and insane FPS drops for me. - Without the frame generation, the game runs quite poorly on RTX 4070Ti. The optimization is absolutely horrible. - Enabling highest resolution textures causes constant pop-in, despite GPU having more than enough memory to store textures. What's the point in offering ab optional high-quality texture pack as a DLC if texture streaming is so broken?   I'm sorry, but I am done giving publishers a pass simply because I like their games. In a full-price title Capcom nickel-and-dimes their players for the basic functionality like editing character appearance, yet they can't be bothered to make sure their game actually works properly.

189462918,english,1,2246340,"[h1]Preface[/h1] Ever since our beloved series reached the eyes and ears of rest of the world, Capcom has made a valiant effort to keep Monster Hunter titles in check with various innovations to keep the series fresh and appealing to a wider audience. Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.  In this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I'm not even looking at you this time, Rise. You're third place no matter what.  [h1]Positives[/h1] [b]Core Gameplay[/b] The core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I've been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it's all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we're all here for it.  [b]Multiplayer & Questing[/b] The lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn't hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I've seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don't see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to ""load in"" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of ""not taking us out of the immersion.""  [b]The Monsters[/b] The bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren't as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don't seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an ""identity"" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.  [h1]Negatives[/h1] [b]Repetitive Flow - For the first time ever[/b] Although the weapons feature numerous ""gimmicks"" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don't get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what's with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...  [b]Items and Builds - Unnecessary?[/b] I have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I'm almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don't really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.  [b]Lack of Central Hub[/b] The number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!  [b]Bland Story[/b] If I don't mention this category, I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with ""Acknowledged"" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] [b]Final Verdict: 8/10 B[/b] Although the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn't a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state. As I mentioned in the preface, Wilds is more of the same in this humble veteran's eyes, and you can sit comfortably in front of your screen and take heart in knowing that even if you don't buy it now, the game isn't going anywhere. The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the ""gotta play the new game"" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven't tried it yet.  Better yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal. One final note in that regard: aside from the achievement that requires online hunting, I still prefer to solo everything without any issue just because I want get those focus attacks in without interruption. Who knows? You might feel the same way, fellow hunter."
189435988,english,0,2246340,"Extremely fun gameplay but cant recommend in its current state.  Exploding polygons/vertices, horrible texture pop-ins, network errors galore. Generally horrid optimization.  There are also some bugged skills that currently do not work with Heavy and Light Bowguns  Burst - Only boosts raw and not elemental Flayer - Doesn't make it easier to create wounds Partbreaker - Doesn't increase damage of focus strikes  Elemental Ammo Tick Rate: Capping your FPS to 35 or 144 FPS gives you more Elemental Ammo Hits (7 instead of 5)   Info taken from Phemeto's latest video on Bowguns   Also a certain gigantic ice monster sometimes gets stuck between arena transitions and vibrates rapidly for a few minutes before it finally gets itself unstuck from the terrain.  If you have a good enough PC or are ok with some frustration along the way its a great MH game. Will change review once Capcom (hopefully) fixes these issues."
188913799,english,1,2246340,This game is a solid 10..... [spoiler] frames per second [/spoiler] on steam deck damn If you close your eyes it look nice  Steam Deck Terrified ✅

188992259,english,1,2246340,"Giving the game a bad review because of performance problems is fair, that said, beyond the technical issues. I am absolutely loving the game. If you enjoyed world and the betas you will love this as well."
188932474,english,0,2246340,Gameplay is great but the optimization is terrible. Frame gen should not be a requirement to hit 60fps. I've played games that look a lot better than Wilds and they ran so much better.
188915753,english,0,2246340,"Absolutely atrocious performance for how the game looks. Runs even worse than the beta. For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. The game does not look nearly good enough to warrant this performance. Everything is covered in a grimy texture with assets that look like you straight took them out of a PS3 game. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this. Embarrassing. Wait for a sale and/or optimization updates. I've played games on my Deck that look better than this. When I was kid I couldn't believe how good MHFU looked on my PSP, an entire world in my hands. And now they release a game like this. It saddens me the mediocrity that Capcom has fallen into. But what do I know, maybe I'm just a little silly billy and my 4070 toaster is just outdated at this point. Guess I'll go back to playing better looking games on ultra."
189138464,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. I have 3000+ hours across the recent titles. I played World/Iceborne on Playstation and then PC over again when the PC versions launched. I did the same for Rise/Sunbreak.  I want to preface that I've finished the main story & beaten every monster the game has to offer.   This game, wholeheartedly, is a downgrade in almost every aspect when compared to the previous titles. It's ""OK"" - but there's a lot of things that are just... bad decisions. They'll sell ""fixes"" through an expansion, like they did with Rise, but it's still NOT GOOD in the current state.  We lost SO many quality of life changes. ---------------------------------   Graphical downgrade and terrible optimization. The game looks brown. Everything looks brown. There's filters/settings enabled that just makes it look *bad* - Sometimes, like in the lush forest, it looks incredible when the fog is off... but everywhere else it looks washed out. The FPS is awful (There's a typo in the config file you can fix to add a little more) and you will struggle to get over 60 FPS on average/decent computers.  No idea what happened in testing.  ---------------------------------  Multiplayer is terribly implemented. There's lobbies, link parties, environment links, and a billion other things you need to juggle just to play with people. We seriously went from >make lobby >join lobby >post quests and play... to whatever this is. Even if you're IN THE ENVIRONMENT LINK WITH FRIENDS you still get disconnected sometimes after defeating a single monster. It makes no sense.   You're forced into 'cutscene gates' where you can't do things with people until you see certain things.. something that was FIXED in World because it was SO HATED AND ANNOYING. It's back! Playing with friends is ROUGH until you're at the end of the game.  ---------------------------------  The game is incredibly theme-parky and ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES exploration. You are tethered to certain areas while doing any story mode missions. World encouraged vertical exploration and players to go around on their own, but on here everything is listed, shown, and auto-pathed to by your mount.   There is no central hub, so it feels like you're constantly jumping around ""exhibits"" to find NPC's, quests, turn things in, and do whatever. It's very broken up, sparse, and feels incredibly clunky and jarring to navigate compared to the previous two titles (and even older ones). I guess they're adding a central hub eventually but didn't have enough time? Sucks.  It feels like they took Frontiers and mutilated it, trying to have an ""MMO FEEL"" without any MMO mechanics. I cannot tell you the number of times I've had to look everywhere to find where to turn in quests.   Even things like MAP MARKERS for camps are buried by other markers IN CAMPS and they're really difficult to see/fast travel to. The way the list of camps were shown in World made it *brain dead easy* to find... How did we go to this?  ---------------------------------  The story is very bland. I'd even say that it's awful. I won't go into spoilers or specifics, but there's absolutely no ""big catastrophe"" you're trying to avert or anything major that's being built up to.   Most of the dialogue is patronizing, condescending, or very ""life is special"" - and it just rings really hokey. There's also not even a dragonator anywhere in the entire game. I'd put it on the same level as ""base"" Rise's story, which says a lot.  There's very few memorable characters, moments, or anything along those lines. Part of what makes some of the story of the previous titles so good is how extra and over the top some of the characters are. Again, no dragonator moments.  It can also be completed in less than 10 hours without rushing. It just kinda.. ends.  ---------------------------------  The experience feels soulless. I dunno how else to put it other than feeling like nothing is inspired, and more like everything was ""lets do this again"" in Wilds. It feels like there was no vision beyond ""Make another World game"" and Capcom executives yelling at the developers to do so. The phrase I've heard a LOT of friends using (who are veterans of MH far longer than I am, since the original) is that it feels *incredibly* corporate.  You kinda just get it as a vibe. As you play through, the longer you play through, you'll understand what I mean.  ---------------------------------  Monster variety is very limited, and there's nothing really ""stand out"". Even the flagship monster is uninspired compared to previous title flagship monsters. Going through the entire game, killing every single monster available, I cannot think of a single one that impressed me or made me go ""woah"" on the same level of things like Vaal Hazak, Velkhana, Malzeno, Xeno'Jiiva, etc had to offer. It feels like you're fighting three archetypes the entire game.  A lot of monsters are repeats from previous games, including the movesets and skeletons (which have been used on a few of the new ones), which is a bit disappointing considering how few actually exist.  I'm actually worried about future content because most of the announced monsters are just filler/mid tier monsters... and the game's already done. The escalation wont be there unless they add things like Alatreon, etc, alongside smaller threats.  ---------------------------------  There's no endgame. You farm two or three tempered monsters at the end and that's it. There's no carrot on a stick to pursue and you'll be done as a dedicated player within a few days.  I won't go into extreme detail but yeah, nada.  ---------------------------------  Decorations are really weird now. Most attack based ones can only be put on weapons (Such as ballistics, etc), which means only 3 slot weapons can fit them. Three slot slots on armor/etc CANNOT wear the same decorations as weapons. This severely limits builds. Most armor sets also are just *incredibly* lackluster when it comes to skills provided.  I get this limits player power but.. it just feels really clunky on how they did it.  ---------------------------------  The entire new wound system is just clutch claw from Iceborne but way more auto-pilot. You do huge amounts of damage while wounding, get free materials, and CONSTANTLY KNOCK DOWN MONSTERS from applying wounds. There's fights you're going to do later once you're geared where monsters cannot get up off of the ground.   People complained about the clutch-claw gameplay and this is just the exact thing.. but WAY more  overtuned and broken. Even the hardest monsters the game has to offer kinda get destroyed by any sort of wound mechanic.  ---------------------------------  The food system is a downgrade. I get what they were going for but in simplifying it they've made it kinda awful. Getting materials sucks, the stores that sell/offer ingredients only seem to give you rations, and the bonuses from food are lackluster. We went from having major defense up, attack up, ammo conservation, and all these other awesome things to just basic buffs.   NOT TO MENTION THERE'S NO PALICO CUTSCENES FOR FOOD COOKING. RIP Grandma food cat.  ---------------------------------  The camera is awful. Monsters are bigger than your screen and tracking is bad. Can't count the number of times later that bigger monsters are just 95% of your screen and you can't see what they're doing fast enough. Even at max zoom/focus it's a downgrade from World.  ---------------------------------  I *want* this game to be better than it is and I know they'll make it better in the future, but man, I wouldn't be surprised if I see lots of people going back to play World/Iceborne after a couple of weeks of Wilds.  Monster Hunter fans will still find enjoyment in the game but the entire way through you'll probably be thinking ""I miss this"" or ""This is clunky"" or ""This was done better"" - and that's just sad to me."

The game runs well on my machine but that's no excuse for how badly it runs on most machines, especially when this is a game that you play with friends.

189397727,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter is my childhood series of nearly 16 years,  [h1]Optimisations are not the sole issue.[/h1]  Performance [i]has been[/i] unnecessarily poor for many people. However, [b]fixing this will not solve the game's frustrating nature.[/b]  [h3]Visual design is great. Combat has been truly impeccable. However, every other sect of direction has lain the devil in the details, creating a grossly obstructive and discouraging experience while taking multiple steps back from the whole series. It's clear the game is unfinished.[/h3]  As a whole package, when only one of the main components established over 20+ years is done well and worthwhile side content is summed up by 'the fishing's kinda cool now', there is a huge problem.  So TL;DR: Roundabout and cluttered UI, [b]a gutting of series mechanics without fun, appropriate replacements[/b] and a story whose beats are brief and forgettable on purpose, yet is frustratingly paced, stretched and ground down rails like something worth telling - handholding far exceeding time actually spent hunting. Insult to injury comes from ignoring Rise for an obtuse multiplayer worse than World's painful 'leave and restart the quest to let friends join' system.   All to imprison you in a title whose major innovation is finally being open world for 'player freedom'.  [h2]So how does this begin to come together?[/h2]  On UI:  Try adding a friend you already know through this game without joining the same lobby. There's no dedicated ""Friends"" menu. You will probably take 10 minutes. Wanna play together? Go to the same lobby. Now you need a link party. Now you need to...  It is [i]all[/i] a sub menu jungle: poorly planned, explained and labelled.  More importantly, there's a HUD ripped from a 'corporate open world slop' mockup you'd find around Elden Ring's release. Most of it can be customised, but there's a beady, omnipresent and unremovable objective marker, duplicated on the un-customisable minimap telling you where everything is through visual barf; it all blends together.  [h3]These features are notorious for stealing your attention from a game. Perhaps forgivable elsewhere, but 2 of Monster Hunter's core components are attacked by this. One by being cheaply replaced. It actually [b]strips the series' special identity.[/b] [/h3]  [h2]What are they and why are they important then?[/h2]  1) [b]Preparation.[/b] Straight forward step. Pick out your items and equipment. Eat. Head out. It's a light strategic phase relying on memory and your personal preference. Without it you make life 10x harder.  2) [b]Scouting and foraging.[/b] Huge part of what makes MH special. Exploration and becoming familiar with a location, its details and secrets were given similar importance to learning the behaviors and patterns of the monster you hunted because of how they - and you - are intertwined. Your understanding is personal and ropes you into feeling part of the world. Since environmental hazards came out, this saw explicit gameplay reward too.  3) [b]Tracking.[/b] Before World it was your way to secure your combat reward for good scouting, with light management because paintballs wore off. World made it an additional reason to engage with the environment; how well it was done is up to interpretation.  4) [b]Combat and chase.[/b] Self explanatory. The meat of the game and main reward for locating the target monster.  You may notice these are simplified steps to actual hunting.   [h3]So which of these are attacked exactly?[/h3]  [b]Scouting:[/b] Immediately knowing where everything is defeats the need and incentive to explore. How the hell are we expected to care for cool spots we never discovered ourselves? Stray too far and the game yanks you away for daring to look at something new. Somehow they removed joy and wonder from higher tier environment design. At least they let us physically ignore 90% of the world by holding a button to laser focus on text in the most braindead iteration of gathering to ever grace us.  [b]Tracking:[/b] This is what's removed outright, replaced by the tacky magic objective marker. Tracks still exist but only give you currency. Scout flies became useless by World's endgame so that's why? [b]Well there's a clear rework they could've done:[/b]  Believe it or not sneak attacks and bushes exist as afterthoughts to some basic stealth system. If they wanted to remove tracking, [b]why wasn't the level design built with engaging stalking in mind, where some monsters only stayed to fight or could lose their special power if we snuck up on them first?[/b] What if our ""intelligent"" seikret could be taught to help with this? Why didn't they replace scoutflies with the raptor following scents?   Wanted to keep the flies and tracking anyway? Have them trained to only follow monsters tagged by paint for the whole hunt. Ruin hiding tactics or some amazing camouflage that's hard to see with the naked eye. It's reason to care about rain too.  Right now, only having prep for battle sounds like a glorified boxing ring. [b]""Monster Brawler"" is not the name of the series.[/b]  [h3]Anything else of value?[/h3]  Each of these are so far absent:  -Home customisation -Endemic life as pets -Mounts engaging in combat -Collectables -Raids  Cooking skill variety is pretty sad compared to every other game too.  MH games always offered 'extra'. (Raids would need improving)  [h2]But the combat's still good, right? How does this affect me?[/h2]  [h3]Lazy choices disrespecting core identity lead to lazy choices disrespecting you and this is present throughout. Not just in boring navigation, backwards menus or some nightmare 4-5 steps with recursive loop to playing multiplayer with friends. So how does combat fare...?[/h3]  [h1]Low Rank is Hell.[/h1]  The mind-numbing kind.  1) [b]A top complaint is hunts being too short.[/b] The devs failed to develop a new, fun, gameplay buildup to engage with before fighting, nor have they balanced the combat to really let you partake in this part's stellar system. 5-10 minutes when hours deep is immensely dissatisfying. It's a potato chip experience: tastes great but is gone too soon. Rise and World got it just right.  2) [b]Build crafting.[/b] Decorations are segregated on whether they're a 'weapon gem' or 'armor gem', removing creative slot management and the satisfaction of optimal builds how [i]you[/i] wanted. Very old games would add to one skill and take from another. Balancing that prevented OP builds better than this restrictive, over-corrective mess.  3) [b]Then there's the story.[/b] World let you breathe - Wilds crushes your windpipe. Progression for ~75% of your first 8-16Hrs is stuck in the most shallow, uninspired nothingburger drivel, forcibly handholding you throughout it all. Some interesting lore and that's it. Frequent are shacklings to tiny spaces just in case you wanted to - God forbid - play the game. Combine how [i]short[/i] the hunts are and the bore drills deep.  [h2]So what's the recurring problem here?[/h2]  [h3]Everything is designed to stop you engaging with the game, both implicitly and explicitly. Going so far as to hollow the experience out and prescribe you a narrow vision on how to interact until finally opening up by endgame. Dozens of hours in.[/h3]  Unlike any other MonHun, you can't really look, learn or enjoy outside combat. Minimal side content. Constant nags on where to go, where to stand, who to speak to and when play's allowed between each. And every. Quest... Sounds like a school - that fun to you?  And it's tragic because there are cool, fun little details with beauty to witness. Again, combat is fantastic. But for all these efforts to make the game worth playing, someone in Capcom's out of touch management either refused to let the game cook or stirred the pot, thinking MH as 'just another action game' when the legs are built on so much more. Now sloppy and missing features encroach on what gives it character.  World:Iceborne remains king. Sunbreak is queen."

The perfomances are one thing I can ignore, it doesn't run good but it runs well enough on my machine, I can wait for updates for that  What I cannot ignore however is the inability of the game working on top of the line AMD GPUs, I have a 7900XT and the game crashed on startup, until I figured I had to turn on WINDOWS 7/8 COMPATIBILITY MODE IN THE EXECUTABLE PRORIETIES   And that's where the huge problem lies, if you turn on Comp mode, half of the textures shit themselves, I'm not talking about a lttle artifact here and there, I'm talking about a MASSIVE artifact covering the ENTIRE screen as soon as there's a rock in frame, this is unnacceptable especially for the flagship product of a company  And you cannot turn it off once you booted, you'd think maybe the issue was shaders compiling, or something But no. Turning off comp mode brings the game back to crash on startup  I still put up with it considering it's either that or no monstie at all, but the review is a solid negative and will stay as is until the problem get hotfixed.  AMD BEWARE unless you're ready to have your eyes bleed. For now at least.  Those armour sets are banging though."
189223176,english,0,2246340,"This might get drowned out by all the reviews about performance, but there are many issues I had with the game past that.  Difficulty: I used pc controls and the lance for the first time for my playthrough and didn't even need to craft armor until Guardian Doshagama, going from 11 defense to 131. From there it was a cake walk just by using what random materials I had from doing quests, even beating a tempered Arkveld right after beating the main story with no problem still using random bs. I understand wanting to make a game accessible to all skill levels, but doing it to this degree gives most players no reason to interact with the open world at all during the story, and considering the lack of postgame, basically invalidates the open world as a whole.  Weapon and combat changes: Counter reliance is bad for monster hunter, and every weapon has some form of counter in this game, with certain weapons revolving around spamming counters now. Plus, certain overtuned attacks have made some weapons lose nuance in gameplay, and in conjunction with wound attacks, makes the combat feel really spammy. Also, the combination of wounds, clashes, and offsets really thrashes the monsters around, making even returning threats feel more pathetic than ever. The majority of combat changes seem to prioritize making the game more cinematic and satisfying over giving it mechanical depth, which I can enjoy for one game, but I hope that design philosophy is a one time thing. [Additional minor nitpick: what kind of logic makes wounds go away when you hit them, and makes it so you can only do certain combos if you start them by hitting a wound?]  Content and pacing: I beat every main quest, side quest, and monster available at launch in 27~ hours of gameplay, and I wasn’t really in much of a rush. What’s arguably worse is that you pretty much fight the final boss in low rank, and the entirety of high rank feels like postgame, with its final fight being a rematch from low rank. Then, there is basically no actual post game other than fighting a handful of tempered monsters harder than what you get from doing the main high rank quests.  Monsters: The new monsters are fine. Since it's a subjective topic, all I care to mention is that the movesets of some seem shallow, and many of their moves plus the new moves given to old monsters seem poor at indicating the direction and space they’re gonna take up. I also think they lack the charm found in many classic monster hunter monsters, but that can be applied to monsters from rise and world as well.  The environment: It's decent, which is devastating in comparison to how amazing the locales were in world. Not including graphical issues, it can be ugly and dark and boring at times, but can certainly be beautiful, especially in the ruins. However, the level of creativity pales in comparison to the fantastical coral highlands and rotten veil. Even the clever use of every single imaginable shape and form of ice in the hoarfrost impressed me more than anything shown in this game. Plus, the endemic life was kind of lame, with many of them being slightly altered, real world lizards. Also, having to catch something for a quest that I already caught previously was annoying.  My general opinion: This game is deeply disappointing to me, not because it's objectively bad, but because I expected much more. It seems like they learned from the feedback given to world, but forgot a lot of what they did to make that game as good as it was in the first place. Also, as I was playing, many aspects of the game seemed like a collection of many good-but-underdeveloped ideas, lacking the depth and attention to detail I was looking forward to from this team. Aside from negative feelings, I was able to make a decent amount of fun of it, but cannot recommend buying this game before beating the majority of worldborne."
192319039,english,0,2246340,"What's so strange about this game is, they've sanded it down with the intent of finding an even broader audience, but the result would be mystifying to me if I was a new player. The game picks a healing item for me automatically, so what is the point of the plethora of different healing items? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) Sharpening my weapon just amounts to pressing a button whenever I remember it, so what is the point of the sharpening mechanic? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) You can beat any fight with any equipment, so what is the point of all these complicated weapon stats? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) It feels like, if Capcom were designing this game from scratch, 75% of these systems wouldn't even be in it. Because they all add friction and Capcom doesn't want there to be any friction any more. In that sense, it's kind of a mess.  Beyond that, the point about the equipment sums up how Wilds has broken the loop that made previous MH games so satisfying (already an issue in Rise but absolutely terminal here). Your impetus for hunting the same monsters again and again is supposed to be that you NEED those materials to win your next fight – and you need to master your weapon for the same reason. But in Wilds none of that matters. I will admit that combat feels great. But WINNING doesn't feel great, because it's no longer the culmination of anything except mashing buttons. The reason I want a real challenge isn't to prove how skilled I am, it's because a challenge makes you engage with the game more deeply, and so gives you a richer, more sustained experience, which you think about even when you're not playing. Without that, you're left with a nicer-looking but much shallower retread of Monster Hunter World, and that hasn't been worth £60 to me. And even if they redeem it to an extent through title updates and DLC, that won't restore purpose to all these legacy mechanics that now drag behind the game like a dead limb."
190858070,english,0,2246340,"It's a fun game. The combat feels nice. The new monster designs are all awesome, and the game's open world has serious potential.  But the frog has been boiled. What started as ""Quality of Life"" changes in World have slowly morphed the series into something totally different than what I think of when I think of Monster Hunter. So many legacy mechanics feel like they're in the game due to obligation. The Seikret trivializes mid-hunt maintenance, I had basically unlimited Mega Potions, Barrel Bombs, anything I needed, and without the need to gather materials or craft much. No more tracking. Wounding makes Hit-Zones irrelevant. The game does everything in it's power to push you back into combat,  which is also easier than it's ever been and is no longer about thoughtful positioning and commitment. Just sit on your Seikret and let it autopilot you to your destination. I did not fail a single quest my entire play-through. I had fun, but I am sad to see the series give up on it's own identity."

189505316,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is a great game ... just not yet and hopefully with some updates my review might change.  The Good  Let’s start with the positives. Visually, Wilds is stunning. Its environments are beautifully crafted, and the combat remains impeccable, carrying forward the deep, rewarding mechanics that define the series. The thrill of the hunt is still here, with weapons feeling satisfying to use and monsters providing exhilarating challenges.  The fishing is also kinda cool now. (Yes, that’s actually a highlight.)  The Issues  However, despite its strengths, Wilds stumbles in nearly every other aspect. Performance has been unnecessarily poor for many players, and while optimizations will likely come in future patches, they won’t fix the game’s more fundamental problems. Wilds takes multiple steps back from the series' core identity, creating an experience that is frustratingly obstructive and unfinished.  UI and Navigation  The user interface is a mess. Something as simple as adding a friend without joining the same lobby is an ordeal. The game’s multiplayer is somehow more obtuse than World’s already clunky system, requiring unnecessary steps just to play with friends.  The HUD is cluttered with unnecessary markers and information overload, stealing attention from the world and combat. Instead of immersing players, it bombards them with visual noise that detracts from exploration.  Loss of Core Monster Hunter Identity  Monster Hunter has always been about preparation, scouting, tracking, and finally engaging in combat. Wilds strips away these core gameplay elements in favor of shallow, modern open-world tropes.  Scouting is undermined by objective markers that tell you exactly where everything is, removing the joy of discovery.  Tracking is gone, replaced by an ever-present magic marker that directs you to your target without effort.  Exploration is actively discouraged, as the game yanks you back if you stray too far.  Combat, while still strong, is hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of hand-holding.  Rather than enhancing the experience, these changes reduce Monster Hunter to a streamlined action game, stripping away the depth that made past titles special.  Low-Rank Experience and Story  Early-game progression is a slog. Hunts are too short, often lasting only 5-10 minutes, making combat feel rushed rather than rewarding. Build crafting has been oversimplified with restrictive gem slotting, eliminating the creativity and satisfaction of optimizing a setup.  The story, meanwhile, is both forgettable and frustratingly intrusive. Unlike World, which gave players room to breathe, Wilds constantly shackles players with excessive handholding, preventing them from engaging with the game on their own terms. The first 10 hours feel like a prolonged tutorial, suffocating any sense of freedom.  What’s Missing?  Many beloved features from past games are either absent or underwhelming:  No home customization  No endemic life as pets  No meaningful mounts in combat  No significant collectibles  No raids  Cooking lacks variety compared to previous titles  These missing elements further dilute the experience, making the world feel emptier and less engaging.  The Verdict  Monster Hunter Wilds has immense potential. Its combat remains excellent, and its world is breathtaking. However, its misguided design choices, frustrating UI, lack of core Monster Hunter elements, and poor pacing make it a difficult game to recommend at launch. If Capcom can address these issues through updates and expansions, Wilds could eventually become a worthy successor to past titles."
189796037,english,1,2246340,"The game's optimization could use some work. Frame rate drops and occasional stuttering are present even on high-end systems. There are also crashes caused by Frame Generation.

Despite the optimization issues, MH Wilds is still a fantastic title and worth checking out."

190185699,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds had a lot to live up to, especially after the success of World and Rise. After spending over 60 hours in the game, I have a lot of thoughts. Some things are fantastic, others are frustrating, and a few are just downright disappointing.  At its core, Wilds is still a Monster Hunter game, which means the thrill of the hunt is there. The weapons feel great, the monsters are well-designed, and the gameplay can be really fun. But… there are some major issues that hold it back. So let’s break it down.  Gameplay - Fun in Its Own Way Monster Hunter Wilds delivers a solid gameplay experience that feels unique and engaging. Despite its flaws, I find myself enjoying the core mechanics, and there’s definitely a lot of potential here.  Weapon Improvements - A Step Forward One of the best things about Wilds is the weapon system. Every weapon feels like a refined and improved version of its Monster Hunter World counterpart. The movesets, mechanics, and overall polish make them incredibly satisfying to use.  Combat - Slow and Clunky Compared to Rise Coming from Monster Hunter Rise, the combat in Wilds feels painfully slow. Rise had a level of fluidity that made the hunts exciting and dynamic, whereas Wilds feels sluggish in comparison. It doesn’t even come close to the sheer fun factor I experienced in Rise.  Multiplayer - No Real Sense of Community Technically, there are plenty of ways to communicate, but the problem is nobody does. The game doesn’t naturally bring players together for multiple hunts; instead, it has this vague ""join a party"" option, which almost nobody uses.  Right now, it's basically: play with real-life friends or hunt alone with randoms who join through the SOS system. There’s no real way to meet new players organically, no sense of community where you can team up for an entire evening, discuss tactics, or just chat about real life. The old hub system encouraged bonding and teamwork—Wilds completely lacks that, and it really hurts the multiplayer experience.  Graphics - Unacceptable for the System Requirements The visuals are an absolute disaster considering how demanding the game is. It feels like a downgrade from Monster Hunter World—everything looks blocky and grainy. At first, I thought it was an issue on my end, but after checking the forums, I realized this is a widespread problem. For a big company like Capcom, this is just unacceptable. My PC is well above the recommended requirements, yet the game still looks underwhelming.  Modding - Almost a Necessity As it stands, mods feel like a requirement to make the game look decent. The fact that the community has to step in and fix visual issues that shouldn’t exist in the first place is frustrating.  Typos in the Config Files?! This one is just baffling. There are actual typos in the config .ini files. It’s a small issue, but it speaks volumes about the lack of polish in some areas.  Final Verdict Despite all its issues, the gameplay itself is REALLY good. But right now, it just barely makes up for the game's many shortcomings. Capcom needs to step up and fix these problems, because as it stands, Wilds is a flawed but enjoyable experience."
189122412,english,1,2246340,"This is my first monster hunter game. I spent about 20 hours in the various beta tests. during my time in the beta tests i went from saying ""i've decided this game isn't for me"" to being one of the ones who stayed up way too late on launch night to finally get to play it again. It took me a bit of time to get accustomed to the controls and figure out how to use my character, but once i had it, it hooked me.  is it a perfect game? no. it has its problems. but for the most part the problems are more nuisances than anything. To be fair, i have a fairly high end PC built in 2019, and i upgraded my graphics card to a 4080 a couple years ago. I haven't had any problems with performance so far. i feel bad for those that are having issues, but my experience has been virtually flawless.  Since this is my first monster hunter i can't really compare it to older monster hunter games. I will say that so far i have enjoyed learning the combat, learning monster patterns and finding new tricks and traps along the way. I have not completed the game, so i have not started into end game, but i don't foresee many problems in end game for my type of play. i don't mind grinding games. i have nearly 700 hours into granblue fantasy relink on PS5 and 200 - 300 in granblue fantasy relink on steam. i enjoy grinding and getting more powerful. so i anticipate the end game will be just fine for me. i will edit my review if that changes.  the couple of problems i have with the game are fairly minor. i get tired of monsters running away. and sometimes running for miles before finally stopping; even when they are near death. it gets so old trying to chase them down as your fully healthy bird can't even catch up with something that is hobbling and stumbling away with broken legs and wounds all over it.  the other problem is with trying to get into a group with friends. the system is beyond complicated. private lobbies are not easy to use and very complex for your friends to try to join. link parties aren't well explained and make no real sense. squads seem to be something akin to guilds. my friend and i are greatly confused every time we try to pair up. joining a lobby with each other often leads to us not being able to see one another. also, even if we are in the same lobby we aren't able to do quests together, you need to be in a link party for that (maybe? since i really don't have a clue) so it's to the point where we join a squad, a lobby, a link party, and then start a quest. for quests in the storyline if you are trying to do the campaign together, you can fight the monsters as a pair, but its janky. when fighting campaign monsters whoever joins the other one gets sent back to the main camp and from there they have to run all the way to the monster to take part in the quest. a monster that is probably half dead by the time you manage to join their quest and load their version of the map and run from camp to the monster; very cumbersome.   i have no doubt that these things will be slowly ironed out over time. it's too bad they weren't solved before launch, but ultimately it doesn't take enough away from the game for me to stop playing it. i am completely enjoying my experience in monster hunter wilds so far and i look forward to putting in many more hours."

Despite having a high-end PC, the game runs as if you're on standard hardware, completely undermining the investment in top-tier equipment. As a long-time fan, it's disappointing to see such potential wasted by technical issues. I can't recommend this game until significant performance improvements are made."
189320522,english,1,2246340,"Granted. I'm only about 14 hours into the game (realistically 10 hours discounting idle time), I don't know if I can recommend this game in it's current state. I'm running a Ryzen 7600X, 7800 XT, 32 gigs of 6000MT/s ram, and 60fps 1440p native is certainly not locked even WITHOUT ray tracing AND with some performance enhancing changes to the game's configuration file. The high res texture DLC exceeds 16 gigs vram and increases CPU utilization to hit 100% frequently, so I just leave textures at High rather than Very High.  So.... with all this in mind, I'm running the game on an SDR 1080p projector with everything turned up to ultra +rt with FSR nativeAA and having a very smooth, somewhat blurry but still buttery experience.

It does feel sort of bad to hit end game so soon for a $70, but Monster Hunter always has a ton of end game content that I am looking forward to get into. My system never crashed FYI even tho others report differently. I played exclusively in single player online. Just a few additional thoughts to add.  +Ray tracing performance hit is way less than many other games, in my experience anyway. Typically its a 1-10% fps decrease from off to high on my AMD GPU +Some characters become more likable. I would have appreciated more interaction with Olivia especially +The monsters get so much better in the last half of the game.

189274464,english,0,2246340,"Monster Hunter World is my favorite game of all time, I have over one thousand hours logged on steam. So to say I was excited for Wilds and all the changes is an understatement.   I have just submitted a refund request for Wilds, as even on fully LOW settings with DLSS performance mode my 3070/Ryzen 7 7800x3D/32gb 6000mhz build is not enough to reach a stable 60 fps in what is genuinely the WORST looking game I have played in recent memory. The game looks terrible. Which is honestly not a deal breaker, but it also FEELS terrible. Constant frame drops during hunts and in the village areas make what is already a poor experience an unplayable one. Even switching to FSR and enabling frame gen DOES NOT HELP, as I can peak 90 fps but still chug down to 30 when turning my character around, making the dips even more jarring.   Monster Hunter World looks gorgeous, miles better than Wilds, and runs at a rock solid 120+ fps, no dips, no stutters, no smeary PS2 textures, and no ai upscaling or generated frames.  Elden Ring, a beautiful open world game runs buttery smooth with visuals that put this game to shame.  Sadly both World and Elden Ring had performance issues at launch that had to be addressed through multiple patches, which seems to be the industry standard now. Hopefully the same happens with Wilds, but until then please DO NOT buy this game. Save yourself the time, energy, and money. I spent 2+ hours fiddling with settings and updating drivers for nothing.  I want to love this game, I really do, but in its current state I wouldn't play it even if it was free. Please do better Capcom"
189024025,english,1,2246340,"Aside from the optimization, this game is amazing. Hopefully they release a patch to optimize it so it isn't terrible for people without high end pcs. Runs fine for me, RADEON RX 7700XT and AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, but i can definitely see the bad perf on worse specs."
190519181,english,1,2246340,From the little time I've been playing MH Wilds I can say that i'm having a fun time hunting.  My enjoyment from the game reminds me and is comparable to when i played MH World I love both games but i do have to say that MH Wilds has its issues so i hope the issues get addressed sooner rather than later.   The game has so much potential and I'm excited for future monsters and collabs!!!
188977098,english,0,2246340,"Extremely promising game, but the performance and lack of optimization makes every form of good will garnered from the gameplay obsolete as the frame rate and stuttering is unbareable.   The recommended specs to run this game that the developers had provided is completely inaccurate and more accurately represents the minimum requirements to play the game. The recommended specs would get 30 fps on the best of days. With an i5-14400F, RTX 4060, and 64 GB of RAM this game STRUGGLES to maintain 60 fps and often sits at 45 fps on high settings at 1080p. Even lowering the graphics quality does not consistently improve frame rate."
189619533,english,0,2246340,"I really wanted this game to be good. I built a new PC primarily just to play this, so I won't speak of the performance issues as they didn't affect me at all. And there were also some positive things that stand out. Weapons feel smoother to play than ever, thanks to focus mode allowing to readjust where you are hitting, being able to skip the quest end countdown is something that was finally added as well, etc. But even considering that, there are just too many issues to wholeheartedly recommend the game.  My main grievances are:  1. Hunters have too much control. Thanks to the wound system basically adding a free stagger that any weapon can initiate at will so long as there is a wound makes the monsters look like clowns. Hunting Arkveld, the currently ""toughest"" monster in the game, is more akin to watching slapstick comedy. Between wound breaks, offset attacks, power clashes, flashes, regular topples, and natural traps if you use them, the monster spends more time on the ground or standing still than actively fighting. This also leads to hunts rarely taking longer than 10 minutes, usually averaging 7 at most.  2. Monsters are not dangerous anymore. If a monster does actually manage to break out of a hunters CC chain, it is till no threat. Be it the generally low damage of monster attacks, the lack of blights, wind pressure, and god forbid tremor (a literal landwhale belly flop and we don't get tremored standing next to it?), there's nothing a well timed offset attack of guard doesn't solve.  3. You cannot repeat the coolest fight in the game. [spoiler]You fight Zoh Shia once at the end of LR and that's it? No way to repeat the quest, no optional, no HR variant? We can't wear it's skin or use it's weapons? I'm sure i can hear the designers crying because they didn't get to make a nephilim themed armour with the whole Black and white theme going on in the fight.[/spoiler]  4. The absolute state of skills. I think the idea of taking a new approach to weapon and armour skills is nice. But the execution is severely lacking.  Locking certain weapons into a skill that is just objectively unusable on it is ridiculous (looking at you, crit draw lances).  But even if the skill would be usable, it might just straight up not work because a lot of them are bugged (e.g. Critical Element, Burst for HBG, ...). Locking a weapon into a specific skill is too restrictive either way in my opinion, but that's subjective.  5. The artian system feels very lacklustre. These weapons are the best in the game for the most part. The actual look of the weapons is at best mid though, especially compared to the other weapons in the game which are absolute peak design. And even if artian weapons have different elements, they all look the same. The way you build them as well feels very shallow and not engaging at all. It never makes sense not to go for element, there is no downside to just going 3 of the same element, you can't forgo element for a boost in raw/crit/sharpness or whatever. You always aim for the same thing. And when enhancing, you mostly just hope for a bunch of attack. And if you are unlucky, all you have to do is chuck the weapon into the ether and try again.  6. There is basically no endgame grind. The artian stuff feels like it was chucked on at the end just to have an excuse for an endgame. But in reality, parts are readily available from tempered quests that take no longer than regular hunts. If you are not planning on making a weapon of every type and element, you'll be done in no time at all. Same goes for decorations. It is obvious that the focus of grinding was supposed to be on something different compared to World. This in turn means, that getting all decorations is very quickly done as well, assuming RNGesus doesn't hate you. There is also no new mantles to unlock. You get a grand total of 4 thrown at you during the story and that's it. No doing all optional quests for a new mantle. Nothing.  While writing this review, I realised that some of these decisions may be to make the barrier of entry for new players to the series easier. But I feel like that is no excuse to leave existing fans of the series by the wayside. In World, i really enjoyed struggling with my friends to find a way to beat a certain monster, or a hunt coming down to the wire with 2 unfortunate carts. I enjoyed finding ways to make certain grinds faster with the variety of tools we had at hand. Finding something new to work towards way into the endgame. In Wilds, there's just nothing.  This game left a void in me. I was looking forward to it. I enjoyed playing through the story, albeit it feeling too easy, but I told myself ""Surely it will get harder in HR/Endgame"". And then I get to the end of HR. I beat Arkveld again. I am excited for what is to come when I hit HR50. What fight will be next? Will we get an elder dragon to fight? Zoh Shia again? What are these artian weapons preparing me for? And then ... nothing. I am left sitting in a mountain of unused relics, decorations and artian weapons. Okay, maybe it's HR60 this time around. I check. Nothing. There's nothing else to do. Hunt Arkveld 30 more times to reach HR100 to unlock more melding that I don't even need? That's it. That's the game done.  It may sound like I don't like the game. That couldn't be further from the truth. I still love the game, I see the vision, and I am looking forward to what the game will become in the future. But right now, I just cannot give the game a positive review. I will revisit this review once we see some more content and these issues addressed.  If you've read this far, thank you for tolerating my rambling. I'm done yelling into the void now."
189877669,english,0,2246340,"[h3]Not recommended with its current state (v1.0).[/h3]  It's a good game (not great). My overall rating is 7/10. Wait until Title Update 4~5 first before buying. Some points of the review is in comparsion with the base game World and Rise when they were first released.  First thing I'm gonna say is what I really like about the game. [list]     [*]Focus Mechanic - With Focus Aim you can freely aim anywhere now. This helps a lot especially melee weapons.     [*]Offset Attacks and Power Clashes - Great way of parrying monster attacks and addition to perfect guards.     [*]Slinger Gathering - No need to go the herbs and pick them up.     [*]New way of story progression. Not just: Hub - Post Hub Quest - Hunt. [/list]  With all the stuff below I hope all of them will get fixed and improve in the future updates!  [b]1. Optimization Issues.[/b] Game doesn't use the latest DLSS & DirectStorage versions for better and stable performance. For texture loading problems, it's as stated by one of the modders as well that capcom devs avoided using RAM/VRAM by streaming things when needed from storage instead of at boot time. All of these has been fixed by modders. And I hope Capcom will fix this on their side.  [b]2. Pop-Up Camps.[/b] There are a lot of QoL improvements but there are some changes that are questionable like the pop-up camps. What's the point of pop-up camps getting destroyed if you just need 75 points to fix them? And with the maps that are much larger than previous Monster Hunter games why not just make all the camps available and not have a limit of five. I do like that you can customize the camps now.  [b]3. Bad UX Design.[/b]  [b]First Alma (Quest/Lobby NPC)[/b] Before with the fixed Hub you always know where to go when you want to do a hunt or do something with the lobby. Because the NPC will not move and the NPC will always be there. Right now at least maybe more than half of the time since your Handler is the same as the Hub NPC, with her coming along with you on hunts, She will not always be beside the Base Camp Tent. She will most of the time walk around the Base Camp and you need to go look for her in order for you to interact with her.  [b]There is no bell sound anymore when someone posts a hunt in the lobby.[/b] Right now in order for you to get notified, when someone posted a hunt is through link party. Link party is good I'll be honest even when you are not in the same lobby you can still hunt with other link party members. But when you and your friends are in the same lobby and not in a link party there is no other way to know that someone posted a hunt aside from saying it through VC if you are in a call or manually typing it in game.  [b]Layered Armor/Equipment[/b] Back in MH World when we got Layered Armor you could link your layered armor set with the equipment loadout you are equipping. But now in order for you to change equipment appearance you need to get out of the Change Equipment and Navigate to Equipment Appearance. This is about 10 button presses average if your equipment appearance loadout is in the first page. Also for the Appearance Menu, they should move the Change Appearance below the Equipment Appearance because you will not always change how your character(face) will look. When changing equipment appearance, me and most people I know accidentally pressed this most of the time instead of moving down below first. For listed menu designs you will always put first the ones that will mostly be chosen to the least one.   In MH Rise the Layered Loadouts are in the Equipment Loadouts already. Even though they are not linked you can just switch between Equipment and Layered with LB/RB or L1/R1. They introduced Hunter Loadouts in Title Update 4 in Rise though. This is a loadout with equipment and layered link and an additional link for item loadout. This is really great especially for gunners since they have different ammos for different weapons.  [b]Raising Kinsect[/b] There is no Kinsect Tree. In order for you to know which Kinsect is better is after you nurture all of them. Back in World there are three tabs when you are crafting/updraging equipment and raising a kinsect. These are the list , tree and zoom view. Right now the one for Kinsect is default into a list view only.  [b]No Abandon Quest/No Mantle Reset on each Quest/Investigation[/b] I get that mantles will continue to cooldown when you are doing a Field Survey but when you are doing a specific quest or investigation from Alma the cooldown should reset. This specific review is not for everyone. But mainly who do speedruns or testing some things on a specific quest. The only available option now is ""Return from Quest"" and doing that uses up everything that you did during the quest (i.e. might pill or traps). You need to replenish the items everytime you do the run again. You also need to wait for the mantles to cooldown. Thus making it inefficient to do runs.   [b]No Copy Lobby/Hunter ID[/b] This is a simple feature to add and the Copy Session ID was already present in the Communication menu in World. There was also a shortcut key to view the Player List before in World when view the menu.  [b]Chat Log Notifications and how it disrupts viewing the Map[/b] The game taught us and it has always been the select key to view the map even from the previous game. In Wilds if there are monster notifications in chat, the select key will be the shortcut to skip the monster and to view the map you need to hold the start key. Every UX Designer knows that this is just bad for ""Navigation Familiarity""  [b]4. Story and Progression[/b] We all know that playing Monster Hunter games is always been the never ending hunting of monsters so I am fine with the story being so simple. I like how the story progresses now than before where you post the main story quest in hub and depart on the quest. I think they are moving close to a RPG type of main story progression with the maps connected to each other. And with locked out paths when you are being accompanied by NPC when you guys are riding a Seikret. And speaking of Seikret...  [b]5. Seikret[/b] Seikret AI is kinda junky at the moment. For sure this will be fixed in the future. Palamutes are the best. Change my mind.  [b]6. Endgame Stuff[/b] [table]     [tr]         [th]Game[/th]         [th]Deco[/th] 	[th]Talisman[/th] 	[th]Weapon Aug[/th]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]World[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]Selectable Augments[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Rise[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Selectable Ramp Upgrades, you can ramp up upgrades every weapon not only rampage weapons[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Wilds[/td]         [td]RNG[/td]         [td]Craftable[/td]         [td]RNG, you can only reinforce Artian Weapons (Can save scum)[/td]     [/tr] [/table]  Right now base endgame hunting, there is only one monster that is worth hunting with the rewards. And that is mostly Arkveld. For full hunt rewards he will get paired up with a random monster and that is a way for you to hunt a different monster aside from him. Half of my saved investigations are Arkveld since other monsters don't have the same amount of rewards. The other half are those monsters with their Gem as rewards. But if you already crafted a lot of equipments that needs a monster gem. You will just go back to Arkveld.  Back in Base World you could always hunt almost every monster in High Rank since you are looking for Investigations with Gold Rewards and every monster investigation can have that reward. Also why couldn't we fight [spoiler]Zoh Shia again. There's no available investigation you couldn't repeat assigned quests.[/spoiler]  [b]Bounties.[/b] Before you could select bounties (optional subquests in Rise) that you want to do while hunting. And then choose a different bounty when you finish them. Now there is only Limited Bounty and they only reset weekly afaik."
190885605,english,0,2246340,"Never in my mind did I ever think I'd have to, at any point in my life, write a negative review for a monster hunter game. As a disclaimer - I am not a hater. I LOVE the franchise. Started back in Tri, buying the game completely by accident. Just by the art on the cover box, having no idea what I am getting into.  I fell in love with it, despite it's clunkyness and the game doing a poor job of explaining itself, but, by the time I finally fell my first Great Jaggi, I was hooked. The constant gameplay loop of killing a big monster, to make gear out of it, to prepare myself for yet another, even stronger monster - it's a magical code for my brain that keeps me coming back to this series.  BUT... It's not present in this one. Game has amazing fundamentals. The movement never felt this good. The weapon movesets have never been this fluid.  It's just a shame that all of it doesn't really matter, when the core aspect of a ""monster hunter"" game has been streamlined OUT of the game and now it's just a generic ""monster fighter"".  Where as the series started as a ""hunting expierience"" with player having to commit on every step, because there were stakes - now there are no stakes and no commitment. Before, you had to prepare your pouch for the hunt, carefully chosing items and stocking up on them. You had to position well during combat, because if you just go out swinging hands, at best you could whiff an attack and deal no damage, at worst you would get punished by the monster and get hit instead (and remember, your amount of potions on a hunt was limited, so you're being tested my friend).  Now, no matter if im running Dual Blades or Great Sword, as long as I am in range of the monster, it's gonna ALWAYS land, thx to the FOCUS mode, which ironically makes your brain lose focus, kinda zone out and let your hands just go through the motions. Feeling like you're fighting on autopilot, completely disengaged. Add to it the wound mechanic, which lets you stunlock the monster. The Palico that makes sure you don't have to bring healing items ever again and magically lays down a trap exactly at the moment that the monster is capturable. All those little things, and suddenly the game fails to provide any challenge. I could go on and on, but big content creators are finally catching up to what I've been heralding since World came out (because World started the trend, but wasn't nearly as sinful as this is) and they have already said everything.  Mechanics such as wind pressure, tremors, seem to not exist. They probably do but I finished all the content (which is not a lot if you skip all the cutscenes and if you COULD skip all the walkie-talkie sections) and I don't remember wind pressure/tremors or such things happening at all. Now - before you come at me, I did watch all the cutscenes, I didn't skip a single one of them, but my friend wanting to catch up to me, did, and he finished ""the story"" in 7 hours, where as I did so in around 20, and it's never a good sign if 13 hours out of your entire 20 for A GAME are filled with cutscenes.   I keep seeing these claims of the game's director that MH Wilds is a great success because of the story... No my friend. It's a great success despite the story, and mostly because World was a huge success. You are kind of getting the benefit of the doubt here, but you are quickly burning it.  This game has very little to do with what an actual ""Monster Hunter"" series was always about.  Expierience-wise: It's a game about hunting monsters, and as a hunter, preparing traps, tracking, doing what a hunter does. Gameplay-wise: Fight a monster, get it's parts, craft better armor, to be able to fight a bigger monster - that is what we would call ""gameplay loop"" in video game design, sadly, it's non-existant here.  Monster Hunter has lost it's soul and it's an extremly sad thing to witness. Because this used to be one of my most beloved things in the world, alongside Zelda, Mario, Metroid, all these big, passion-filled creations. And now, one of them is getting destroyed.   I might stick around to see Wilds getting it's G-rank expansion, but If the series doesn't change the course to revert some of it's streamlining, this might be the last monster hunter game I ever play."
188928667,english,0,2246340,"I was crashing a TON on a high-end rig, but changed my XMP profile in BIOS to normal, reverting my RAM to its normal speed, and the crashes are almost non-existent now.  Hoping they keep working on fixing performance issues so every hunter, old and new, can have a smooth and fun experience with this game, cus it is REALLY fun. Will change to positive after they address these glaring issues.  I think Wilds improves upon World in almost every way. The combat feels great with the new additions. The music and sound design are spectacular. Monster designs are REALLY cool so far. I don't care too much about the open-world aspect. It's kinda cool, but zones have always been fine. Almost out of low rank and looking forward to more monsters to fight! (pls let me put endemic life on display in a customizable house again PLEASE!!!)  Capcom, when will you stop adding so many hoops to jump through just to play with people!?"
189375149,english,0,2246340,"I don't think I've had this much fun with a game in a long time. I absolutely love Wilds. It's not perfect, but I love it.   However, it's impossible for me to leave a positive review for this game at its current state. It's probably one of the most unoptimized games in the last 5 years and Cyberpunk came out during this period. This speaks volumes! Capcom needs to pull their sh#t together and fix their game."
188913845,english,1,2246340,"""Monster Hunter Wilds: I'm Ready"" But RE engine is definitely not ready tho. Don't worry, even though it looks bad, at least it runs poorly. Trying to brute force RE engine into open world games clearly just does not work."
188981574,english,0,2246340,"Played the beta, ran like ass. Hoped they'd fix it. Ran the benchmark, good results, thought they'd fixed it. Paid the silly price of games these days... didn't fix it. Such a shame because you can see the gameplay is there, the combat is there, the environment is there... would just be amazing if you could actually play it. I think a privately hired dude showing you each frame on flashcards as fast as he can be arsed to would give you a smoother experience.  Refunded and i'll be back when you make this obviously great game playable."
191400647,english,1,2246340,"[h2]Monster Hunter Wilds[/h2]  I have to say that I personally haven’t had any performance issues with the game. However, I acknowledge that I have a powerful system, and weaker configurations might struggle. Still, I can’t criticize the game for problems that I haven’t experienced myself. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3438993521 Just like with Dragon’s Dogma 2, I’m so happy to see a AAA project that isn’t running on Unreal Engine that I’m willing to forgive some of RE Engine’s quirks, even though it’s clearly not the best for open-world games. It’s a shame that developers like CD Projekt Red decided to abandon their own RED Engine in favor of the more popular Unreal Engine. Cyberpunk 2077 is literally the most beautiful game right now, while Unreal Engine games often look similar to each other. If you play them back to back, it sometimes feels like you’re playing the same game over and over again. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3437765725 As for Monster Hunter, the combat in this game is absolute cinema. There aren’t that many monsters yet, but the developers have clearly focused on quality. The fights feel well-designed and polished. The game itself plays and controls very well. I think they’ll improve performance over the year, and there’s no doubt they’ll deliver more content. Fans have shown massive support by buying a huge number of copies at launch, so Capcom has no excuse not to support the game - unlike Dragon’s Dogma 2 (which, unfortunately, probably won’t be getting any DLC). https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3436312302 The story campaign is fairly short and simple, but it does a good job of introducing newcomers to the game’s overall vibe. However, while they made things easier for newcomers in that regard, the co-op experience (group creation, frequent disconnects, and inconvenient rejoining) could really use some improvements. A more seamless co-op system would be great. Overall, the game is fantastic. The combat is exciting, though maybe a bit easier at launch (some mechanics have been simplified compared to Monster Hunter: World), but it’s still highly addictive!"
191390519,english,1,2246340,"This game feels like a fine dining experience—elegant, delightful, and entertaining, but also pricey and a bit lacking in portion size. Still, with frequent updates and improvements, it could remain fun and engaging for a long time."
189007625,english,0,2246340,This game needed another few months entirely dedicated to optimization and bug fixing. There is so much wrong with the performance of this game.
191069105,english,0,2246340,"[u]This is a review from a veteran who started way back in MH3U and having played every single mainline/portable series ever since.[/u]  This is an unfinished game, unoptimized mess. With the developer intention of going mainstream the game just become way too easy with so much handholding in the early part of the game to the point that the difficulty is almost nonexistence and while still having an unchallenging endgame, being forced to jump through multiple hoops just to play with friends with the bloated co-op menu, monotonous and confusing map design, seriously i cant even memorized most of the map yet after 100 hours in and after already platinum'ed 200 hours later. make no mistake this is a still good game but seriously need more time in the oven for it to be great. in this current state i would say this game is still a ""premium"" beta. if ur new to the series and wants somewhat of a challenge go for World or if you really want a challenging experience go for Rise instead. Wilds is really just walk in the park.  p.s this review will be edited if the game gets better with updates in the future."
188998422,english,0,2246340,"Denuvo locked me out while I was troubleshooting start up crashes. Apparently, it counts every time you switch Proton versions as a separate installation. Thanks, Capcom, for using such an aggressive DRM!"
190336674,english,0,2246340,"The game is WILDly underperforming even on high-end hardware. Frankly, I have little to say that hasn't already been said by others. Performance aside...  1. There's a strange pivot away from the ""hunting"" aesthetic in this title. There's no more tracking, monsters are always seen on the map and you can automatically run to them (without any input, really). I can appreciate QoL that speeds up the game a bit, but these are key aspects that are required for proper gameplay pacing and made other Monster Hunter games feel the way they do. 2. The game is lacking some serious gameplay variety through features like the Private Quarters (from World). Because the pacing of hunts is already cranked to an all-time high, having nothing else to do makes the game turn into this boss rush with no meaningful breaks. To me this made it much easier to burn out on this game than on World. 3. I wouldn't expect an endgame given that there is no Master Rank yet, but I do want to point out that the game's existing endgame doesn't offer all that much. It's an upgrade from base World's endgame grind, but that's not saying much given how tedious World's was.  Overall, while it's a good new entry in the series, its problems currently vastly outweigh its strengths and I would recommend players to wait for updates. A lot could be done to address these concerns and I have high hopes that Capcom will listen to the players post-launch to release some much needed changes.  If you're still interested in playing the game, I'd say only buy the game if you're very certain that you can run it properly. The Benchmark tool, according to many, is not an accurate assessment of final performance, so do take it with a grain of salt.   I will change my review once Capcom has committed to addressing aforementioned issues."
188945286,english,0,2246340,"I love Monster Hunter. World is one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay in this is good, because it's Monster Hunter.  However, if you aren't already a MH fan - I would stay away:  This game looks and runs like absolute dogshit. Actually, worse. It's pretty impressive that this team was able to take such INCREDIBLE assets like the character models, monster designs, and animations - just to take them all out back, smear them in horseshit and weigh them down with stones until they flatten into a miserable experience that is barely playable. With a 4070 and i7 14700kf 32gb of RAM I NEED to use a third party program (shout out Lossless Scaling) to make the game playable on medium settings. It looks HORRIBLE. The textures are muddied over from the (again, necessary) upscaling and everything turns into a ghosting mess. FPS will swing +/- 40 frames when nothing is happening at all.   Making the deliberate choice to use the RE engine for this after the absolutely abysmal fuckup that was Dragons Dogma 2 is fucking astounding to me. The level of disconnect between people who actually played this thing before launch and the reality in which we all live has reached a point that it should be studied by psychologists and philosophers alike as an example of incredible survival within a complete delusion and degredation of the mind. It's an affront to the effot of everyone who worked on rest of the game.   Don't plan on playing this with friends either, the system for joining and creating parties is, once again, a miserable and complicated experience that's buried within layers upon layers of disconnected menus and constantly changing hotkeys, with three different types of ""party"" for you to be in or out of at any time. If you are looking to pull up a friends list, hit ""invite."" and then start playing? Find a game that respects your time in that regard.  I know they still ""got my money,"" and I'm victim to ""I love thing and want thing so I'll play it anyway."" But companies need to stop releasing games like this. I don't think I'll be on board for another one. If you don't love Monster Hunter enough that you'll deal with hating yourself for this purchase because you just NEED IT - DO NOT BUY"

One small issue I have is the story is very rails - the Seikret and game pretends im in control as we go between points, but I am not at all. Would rather the game didnt lie to me rather than have me diagnostics check whether my controller is responding.

188916638,english,1,2246340,"Monster Hunter Wilds is the next major instalment in the Monster Hunter series. What Monster Hunter Worlds had, Wilds sadly, just falls short on what World's had. Not completely in a bad way but it is missing the ""good"" stuff about worlds - the end-game. After playing for 30 hours I can now tell you what I think about it!  EDIT: Review is up-to-date as of 18/03/25  Below I will state any issues, my pros and cons but first a quick disclaimer!  [b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b]   [h1][b] Pros[/b][/h1]  ⚫Monster Hunter Rise let you ride around on a palamute, in Monster Hunter Wilds you get to ride around on a Seikret that can GLIDE!?!?!?! I love it!!! ⚫So far, the improvements to weapons are amazing! Got my gunlance ready to be mastered again and now you can carry ANOTHER WEAPON!?!?!?! Now to swap between my bow and Gunlance whenever I want!!! ⚫Cooking has had an overhaul. Now, when you eat food buffs last a set time and they don't go away until the timer runs out, a bonus with this - the timer does not count down when you are in your camp... AMAZING!!! So much smoother now!! ⚫Each area is seamless so far. Full of life and stunning locales. Not only that, each area has weather that changes which adds to land itself. It really makes the land feel alive!! ⚫The monsters look stunning and all of their animations are just... spot on. I cannot tell you how much I love their animations and how amazing they look, especially with the HD texture pack. ⚫You can craft Artisan weapons which are insanely fun to use and to top it off these weapons deal devastating blows to monsters.  [h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1]  ⚫I have seen a lot of people say that the game is ""TO EASY"" - okay, it is much easier. MUCH easier, BUT it's only just out. Give it time. They can always add in Tempered or Arch tempered monsters or heck... a new difficulty bump setting at a later date.  ⚫Charging almost £10 for character edit vouchers is... not right. I am sorry but that's disgusting.  ⚫I have had a few ""performance"" issues here and there. A bit of lag, stutter and occasionally my textures turn to playdough. Another case of ""RELEASE NOW - PATCH LATER"". ⚫The end-game is a disappointment. You are forced to hunt the same 6 monsters over and over again - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna.... making the other 22 monsters completely useless. You will hunt the other 22 about... 1-3 times each and then never have to fight them again. Read about the end-game below!  [h1][b] How the End-Game works [/b][/h1]  So, don't hate me if I got this wrong - You open your map, look for 1 of the 6 TEMPERED monsters you are ONLY allowed to hunt - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna - if one is there, you save it as an investigation and you go do 1 field survey of it, then do the 3 investigations.   If none is there, you go back into your tent, rest (set weather and time to your liking) and then open your map and have a look again. If none is there, repeat. If one is there do the step above.  I am sorry... but this is the worst part of MH: Worlds.   [h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]  Coming from Monster Hunter Worlds and Monster Hunter Rise, Monster Hunter Wilds is definitely a step forward in some aspects but in others... 2 steps backwards, end-game and difficulty being the negatives.  If you are looking for a GOOD end-game, wilds sadly does not offer that, unless you don't mind brainlessly hunting the same 6 monsters for hundreds of hours for that one artisan weapon piece you need.  They have made Monster Hunter Wilds so much more approachable by making it easier for newer players. Do not judge it to harshly just now on that, its only just out, think towards the future for a DLC like Iceborne!!  [h1][b] 7.5/10! Many improvements but a lacklustre end-game makes for a dull experience sadly  [/b][/h1]"
190777174,english,0,2246340,"The game is fine but the challenge has been scraped away and the story is rather not desired. If you're thinking this is worlds 2 then you'll find it isn't.   It's a 70$ base game. It can handle a thumb down review especially since when it'll become ""good"" is when we all pay for a 30-50$ expansion."
188971275,english,0,2246340,Leaving this a Negative Review until they address the performance issues. Game constantly crashes and the frame rate is almost half of what I was able to get with the same settings running the benchmark prior to release.
188977489,english,0,2246340,"As others have started, optimization issues are the death of this game.  Honestly, I'm think the game ran better on the Steam Deck during the OBT than it did on release day.   I love this franchise, while I would love to give it a better score, I cannot experience the game.   A lack of modern hardware isn't an excuse for leaving a game unoptimized. There's no reason why my RTX3090 should be struggling, or for there not to be Steam Deck specific settings to let it run on there.  I will gladly change this review when the issues are resolved."

189114692,english,0,2246340,"I've never returned a Monster Hunter game, but I'm really considering it for this one. Monster Hunter World is my most played game ever, followed by Monster Hunter Rise. I love these games. Even MHW had teething issues when it first released, and it was eventually improved and I was willing to upgrade my hardware to run it better. Wilds doesn't feel that way because:  1. It just doesn't look good. Textures are muddy and often incredibly pixelated. Hair, clothing, tents, wood structures, you name it, all look like a phoned-in effort at best. Once in a while you see a really nice texture, which only makes the rest look worse.  2. Despite the low quality textures and muddy sheen, performance is miserable. For reference, I'm on a 3080, and no matter what I set my options to, I can't break 60 fps. And once monsters come on screen, or any action happens, it's stutter city.  3. I know Capcom is capable of doing better. MHW and MHR both, IMHO, looked better and performed smoother than this one. It hurts to know they can do so much better, but didn't.  4. Co-op play is only ""sorta"" there. I buy these games to play with friends, and the way co-op works, you can't play through the story with them. You ""kinda"" can, but not really. It became frustrating enough that everyone basically said they'd just play through solo and consider multiplay when they all finish the campaign. Not the worse issue. Just an annoying one.  5. A loss of exploration. They touted that it was a big open world, however it's almost pointless to explore anywhere so far. When playing the story, if you wander too far from where they want you to be, they forcefully rotate your camera back around and tell you, ""no."" They don't tell you where to go, just where not to go. Frustrating.  6. Critics have seemingly ignored all of this. I don't why this bothers me so much. I myself am considering holding onto the game just because I love Monster Hunter so much. But the numerous glowing reviews seem very ""off"" to me for all of the aforementioned reasons.  Your mileage may vary. I wish you luck. If you have beefy hardware with all the framegen necessary to smooth out this mess, then all the power to you. I tried using the ""Lossless Scaling"" app to add framegen to my own setup, and it helped substantially. Though it still stuttered in battles, with the game looking worse than any previous Monster Hunter title I've played."
188953758,english,0,2246340,"I very rarely write reviews but i was looking forward to MH: Wilds as it looked closer to the only MH i enjoyed, MH World.  The fact is, the game is in a state that is not playable or acceptable for me at this current price.  3080 + Ryzen 5900x not being able to run the game at steady 60fps with Medium settings and DLSS on Performance is what it's actually WILD....  Will buy the game again when these glaring optimization issues are fixed.  In the current day and age where I can run just as incredible looking games, if not better, at Max Settings with 144fps, this is just simply unacceptable for me at the current state & price."

Despite all my efforts, setting everything to low or off in the settings, I can get maybe 60 FPS if I'm lucky, and the game looks like garbage to boot. The problem is it uses the CPU to render graphics instead of, y'know, the Graphics Processing Unit, so people like me who have a pretty good graphics card are punished for having a cheaper CPU to compensate. It seriously sucks that I can't enjoy a game I've been waiting years for just because I don't have the money for an expensive CPU for just this game. Save your money, wait until they finally do something about this, and if you already bought it, complain like me so we can force them to do something. This is ridiculous."

Performances are not great all around, and you will need need to run Reframework mod if you want not just better perfs but also perfect ultrawide support.  Outside of that I have a few caveats with the game: -Limited number of camps. Why? -Many bugs when it comes to skills. -Skills, as usual, don't tell you the value of what they give you most of the time, which is dumb.  Anyway, buy it, mod it, and enjoy the ride. It's a good game."
188988343,english,0,2246340,"Complain and let them hear you. This game rocks, but the performance feels sloppily done. This can be great, just need the devs to slot in peak performance for the optimization"
189253854,english,0,2246340,"+ loads of QoL changes added compared to world + Voice acting on player character - horrendous performance - lack of end game content - story is a walking simulator - no personal room - have less monster count vs world ( 29 vs 30 ), and there is reuse from world - alpha & beta set is just a color change, not a design variation - blowgun bind recoil to ammo type, and can no longer reduce it through customization  In conclusion this is a half finished product, somehow Capcom have a worse launch than MHRise, In its current state I don't recommend this game"
189012561,english,0,2246340,"Thanks Capcom and Denuvo, I love buying a 70 dollar game and being slapped by Denuvo saying they can't validate it. I don't give a damn I paid for this game and it's already been a nightmare to get this unoptomized mess running!"

189075115,english,0,2246340,"So two things, this game in terms of game-play is impeccable, easily one of the best monster hunters they have ever made if we are talking strictly in terms of how the game plays. However this game runs really, really bad unless you have a supercomputer, horrible FPS and poorly optimized, this game needs a few patches for sure and hopefully Capcom will do them unlike Dragons Dogma 2. Great game on the merit of the game itself, but runs absolutely awful, I think we can say by now the RE engine was not made with games like this in mind."

189110461,english,0,2246340,"Love this game, for me its easily a 9/10 maybe even a 10/10 I have beaten LR and rolled credits and I'm currently making my way through HR. But I cannot, under any circumstances recommend this game to anyone in its current state due to performance and I'm primarily writing this review to add to the discourse in a way that Capcom can respond to and hopefully address.   I am running a 3070ti and Im managing anywhere from 70 - 110 fps on high preset setting with some tweaks, how you might ask? By leaning on AMD's FSR with framegen enabled and dropping my resolution down to 1080p. This works to create a somewhat smooth experience, especially on controller where I feel input lag less, but what it does not create is a beautiful experience. The game is stunning and I say that as someone that thought the game was a washed out mess at first. When they allow it to during different in game 'seasons' colours begin to pop and areas really come to life. Unfortunately due to my settings FSR tends to make textures blurry and muddy, especially at a distance, so until they can fix the absolutely terrible optimisation my game will continue to look like this.  I will update my review if and when fixes come through, the more I look at it, the more I am certain this game was rushed out the door before it was ready. Do not buy this game if you aren't a fan of the series already, wait for the updates and by then there might even be a discount."
189002811,english,1,2246340,"Yes. The game is poorly optimized, who knows why Capcom went with the RE engine making a giant open world game, but it is seriously not that bad if you play on Medium settings. I was trying to play on high and it was terrible after playing for roughly 3 hours before I changed it to Medium. Once I did change it, it worked perfectly fine with no hiccups. Capcom do better, but absolutely stellar game nonetheless.  32GB Ram AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600 NVIDIA 4060ti"
188997656,english,0,2246340,"I'm enjoying it, but the presence of Denuvo means that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the game on anything less than very recent technology (RTX 40 series, Intel 13th gen, etc.)  To be honest, the game is just poorly optimized. I am able to achieve higher than 60 FPS on my own setup without frame generation, but I can still tell something is just not quite right. It runs worse than the betas did, but there's one word that easily explains this.  Denuvo. Denuvo is that word. Why is anyone still using this garbage?  If something changes on this front (I don't expect it will, Capcom is notoriously stubborn on this point) then I may consider changing this review.  Again, I am enjoying the game. But for the purposes of recommending this game to the wider public, I feel the need to leave this red so that people REALLY consider whether this is a worthwhile purchase for them."

I really wish Wollay stuck around through all the backlash and really polished this game up to perfection À la No Man's Sky.

165255405,english,0,1128000,"I've wanted to enjoy this so bad since it launched on steam but it's just so annoyingly bad.  For starters, there is no clear cut leveling system. All of your stats are tied to your gear that you find/craft. There's no experience points and no abilities or talents to work towards unlocking. The latter isn't necessarily bad, but having access to all your class abilities from the start is slightly boring. It's an RPG with no skills to unlock. it feels weird.  The enemy scaling is terrible. You could start a new character, see some bugs in the distance you think you can take on and then be dead 10 seconds after attacking them.   Your gear is region locked. If you enter a new zone you have to re-obtain special equipment (boat, glider, etc.) for that zone and all of your gear gets downgraded. Did you spend a long time obtaining/crafting the best gear you could? Better get ready to do it all over again cause it will be useless if you enter a new region! And because your stats are tied to your gear (since there's no exp based leveling system) you're basically level 1 when you enter a new region!  Traveling becomes kind of annoying after a while. You will either need to find and tame a ride-able pet to speed you up or spend gold on flight paths.  Good luck trying to progress if its night time in game. This game is so unreasonably dark you cannot see anything. Your lantern does not provide enough light. Oh, and there is no brightness setting to crank up to get around this issue. So there's that.  Word gen customization. In the Alpha version of the game you could enter custom seeds for your world generation which was neat. That feature is gone now in this version. There aren't even world slots for you to use. It just assigns a world to your character and that's that.  This game had such potential to be amazing. A lot of people loved the alpha release, but the developer took so many steps in the wrong direction with this.  Don't buy the game. Not worth it unless the dev comes back from the dead to finish it. If you really want to play it though, make sure you mod it. I recommend trying CubeMegaMod. It's one of the few mods that are still compatible with the game."

Well... coming back to the crushing reality. I wish they had dropped it.

The game is probably not worth 20 dollars but its still an extremely fun game if you have the dedication to play it. There are some huge flaws with the game that cause people to not buy it. 1. All players are on the same server with different regions and biomes, the problem with this is that players can spawn in a biome with insanely strong enemies and be very stuck. 2. All your equipment and gear downgrades to practically shit once you leave the region it was found in. 3. the leveling system is terrible consisting of collecting ""artifacts"" which barely increase any of your stats such as +3% climbing speed. Now for the upsides. 1. The graphics are amazing and the art and design is great. 2. the gear system i personally think is more improved than the alpha version as now its a star system instead of +1 2 3 etc. 3. Your given a wide verity of weapons to chose from 3 for each class each with its own attack speed, right click attack, and some of them you can dual wield. In short, Cube World steam version had almost achieved a perfect game but it strayed too far from the alpha, if you have a spare 20 dollars spare and looking for a grindy game, this is the game for you. (or if you want free just search up on google for alpha)"
175409709,english,0,1128000,"Really good concept but unfortunatly i cant recomend this as it is just a lvl 1 grinding simulator for every new area you go into. you dont ever feel like you get genuinly powerful and the few items that can scale across zones, + items, are random drops with no consistent way to get them ie. crafting questing etc. over all cool game idea but poorly executed and from reading some of the other reviews you may have seen that the prealpha was pretty fun and a good experience but this is just disapointing at the current state of it and im 90% sure they aren't updating it anymore, truely sad, not worth the $25 NZD."
178964740,english,1,1128000,"I played this game in the Alpha version a pretty long tome ago, so I have nostalgic memories of Cube World. I played it recently and bought the steam version and here's what I have to say about Cube World in general:  I truly believe this game likely would have been a titan in the ""block game"" category if the creator didn't take a hard left turn when updating it past alpha to put on steam. Alpha world generation is peak world generation, the game was simple and had an addictive gameplay loop. Improving skill trees, adding human companions, improving village generation (or making a quest based generation) could have been implemented to make the game perfect.  Cube World Steam Version changes the main gameplay loop entirely. crafting materials are rarer and loot drops are better, and there is no level restriction on equipment. The new gameplay loop is kill bosses, loot better gear, kill more bosses. The objective of Steam Version is to collect ""Artifacts"" around the biomes which give random improvements to abilities. Leaving a biome removes all the items collected and ""resets"" your character. This is a literal gameplay ""Loop."" Once you complete the first area, you have to do the exact same thing again from the bottom. Dying in steam version also sucks. Even with gear equal to the boss, you are still extremely likely to die if you don't cheese the boss. respawn areas are 1-3 entire minutes away from boss locations, so you are stuck holding W and maybe scrolling on your phone for 3 minutes just to die immediately and do it again. This is where I stopped playing Steam Version, fighting the highest level enemy with the highest level equipment and losing multiple times.   The alpha version is a craft/loot combination exploration game. You start out extremely weak, dying to every wild animal. Finding crafting materials and fighting the few enemies you can defeat lets you get better armor and use the very limited skill tree. Killing the bosses scattered around the map provides you with special crafting materials for weapons and a bunch of exp. As you level up, you can craft better gear and equip better gear. That is the gameplay loop of alpha Cube World. Craft and equip gear to kill difficult bosses, level up, craft more gear and fight more bosses. The distance between bosses in alpha is still obscene, but there are respawn points 15 seconds away from every boss, and the areas in between are filled out better with ore, crafting materials, and radiant bosses.  I really wish this game was moddable. Sadly, it seems that the developer made a lot of the code and programs very unfriendly to modders. The 4-5 mods for this game are not true scripted mods, but are instead mods that change 1 or 2 numbers of a variable.  Heres how I suggest enjoying cube world:  1. Buy the steam version and play it for a few hours. Don't hurt the developer because you don't like how they manage their game, they still deserve support for creating the game you are playing.   2. Look for the alpha version download online. Download that version and play it for a few hours as well. The game is very hard in the start because everything can kill you, so don't get discouraged right off the bat. There is little skill mechanics in the game, enemies auto lock attacks, have super far reach and attack faster than you can dodge. You are required to get better equipment to defeat enemies."
191523910,english,0,1128000,"Cube World had so much potential, especially after the promising alpha that got a lot of people excited. The voxel-based world, the exploration, and the RPG mechanics all seemed like they were building up to something great. But when the full release finally arrived, it just didn’t live up to expectations.  A lot of the mechanics that made the early version enjoyable were completely changed or removed, and the progression system felt more frustrating than rewarding. Instead of leveling up and growing stronger over time, everything resets whenever you enter a new region, making long-term character development feel pointless.  The world itself is still visually charming, and the movement and combat can be fun for a while, but the game lacks the depth needed to keep players invested. It’s a real shame because the foundation was there for something amazing. Instead, Cube World feels more like a hollow version of what could have been.  If you loved the alpha, you might find some enjoyment here, but be prepared for a very different experience. Otherwise, it’s hard to recommend, especially when so many other open-world RPGs do it better."

Things i dislike, Region locks on certain gear that may be unobtainable due to generation, at least add it to the store or have it as a crafting recipe such as boats, gliders and things to that effect and maybe make legendary armour blue or green ranked in the other regions so when someone has spent a while doing one specific area they don't feel cheated from all their hard-work, i also dislike the fact there's no journal to task Sub-quest or make goals such as an NPC saying ""I want a Bird Pet"" and you can go out of your way to then give it to them for a reward of some kind, i don't know if its already in the game currently as my example, but if it isn't i personally feel like it'll give the game more life and personality, and from what I've watched i hate the fact there's no more large city generation nor criminals you can encounter, such as bandits or thieves in said cities, i also dislike the repetitiveness of the NPC'S, id like for example, the saving quest to be a random race but for it to make sense, so one person you save will be a Blacksmith and make Armour and increase the quality of every store in each region and a weapon-smith to make weapons and increase the quality of every store, and maybe make a library so Mages can learn a subclass like ""thunder"" and ""gravity"" and ""necromancy"" and make an NPC you save to make those classes obtainable through saving them, i also hate it how the diving event consumes gold, it doesn't make any form of sense, just make an oxygen meter for the living races and for the undead and such make it use mana and make it if you add any water-breathing races that they can swim for as long as they want possibly add water breathing items into the shop or as a gear, maybe enchanted hood or such, or potions that you can consume and the bombs from what i have used do nothing, i also dislike it how even if i spawn right next to them they come back with full health at least make it so if i got below half health they stay on half until they kill me again if i did no damage again or if i die in a stupid or moronic way  Things id like to see added, besides the few classes i mentioned i feel like a ""bard"" class like in D&D would be nice to see, maybe make a spear class (maybe off the warrior that you can obtain off an NPC you save maybe?) and maybe make a Bestiary for when you defeat (or die to) a monster, otherwise this game is a gem and i do hope Mod developers come back to really work this game out, encase the current developer is unable or not willing to continue this game or possible franchise  Things i enjoy: i enjoy the combat, as basic at it might be you can do a lot and get away with even more, for example i'm a mage and i can quite literally cast fire missile and knock about all of my enemies out giving me a chance to run away, get to a higher ground to knock them out again to finish them off, i love the dungeons/crypts though they could do with the bosses of the dungeons/crypts having less health than 21k and like 33k health but still make it difficult in 10k or 15k, the 21 and 33 mark make it to grindy and repeating at least for me and i love the map size, absolutely huge so i have no complaints other than the region locks."
184386985,english,0,1128000,While there is more content than the alpha its' all so shallow to the point where it doesnt even really matter. World gen for me is the biggest grievance the alpha had very beautiful and vast landscapes with rolling hills and mountains now its all flat and boring like the map is an after thought just a formality between point A and B and not this massive world meant to be explored.

189608531,english,1,1128000,Its still fun to kill time and hey if mods were supported i bet the community could make it better it really isnt a bad game just give it a shot i still have fun with this game
169728205,english,1,1128000,This game's world always captivates me. Had fun memories. The only bad side is limitation to exploration (you have to start from scratch every new area you go) and immense cpu usage. I wish this game had more updates.
173454486,english,1,1128000,"So after reading all the reviews I was very sceptical about buying this game, but after playing the alpha for a few days, I wanted more, so I decided to bite the bullet and buy this full release. When I tell you I was shocked at how so much of the backlash against this game is unjustified. You would think this was a completely unplayable mess but it is so much like the alpha that I don't understand why it gets so much hate.   The most notable difference is the levelling up system. Instead of earning xp for each kill, your progression level is tied up with the weapon and items you have equipped, and I think this makes for a unique level system that I haven't seen a lot of. There are so many more mobs that are fun to discover and the terrain is so much more varied, there are new structures, the respawn points are in little ancient Greek style temples, some even on floating islands that I haven't figured out how to get to yet (near them is an alter type structure with an eagle statue so I'm sure later when I progress more, there will be an item to activate them somehow.) And also there are a lot more wandering npc's in the world, some friendly and some foe, and this just makes the world seem more alive.  Another plus is npc's, both in towns and in the world, are actually useful to interact with. A lot of times I will speak to someone and they will add a quest to the map for an item to get or someone to save, or even just a rumour they heard, and it feels very dynamic, not just ""oh here's a quest, check it off, here's your reward"".  Something I noticed as a minor downside is I think the lighting as changed from the alpha, because I noticed there isn't the same hazy shadow on everything like there was in the alpha, but this is so insignificant that it isn't a reason to not like the game.  As someone who was absolutely obsessed with the alpha when it came out, I 100% recommend buying the full release. It's not that expensive, if you want to wait for it to go on sale whenever, do, but don't be fooled by all the negative reviews that are only based on nostalgia. This game came out 5 years ago and I didn't buy it on release despite waiting years because of all the backlash, and all I can think of is all the time I wasted, because Cube World is an amazingly fun game."
178854655,english,0,1128000,"It's too hard to get levels because every time you run into something, it's a level 10 dragon so you need to avoid almost everything so you don't die. I got killed by a SINGLE BEE!!!   These is almost nothing in the world but tiny structures and villages and that makes the game feel really empty and there is very few differences between the areas and the only difference at all is the color of the trees and ground.  There are no real quests, just tiny hints of relics somewhere very far away and that's another thing, since it's so easy to die, 1 minute in and you get stung to death by bees and need to start the trip over like 100 times until you finally make to the spot only for it to be rusty armor.  Overall a bad game, it feels like a practice project or a built-in engine tutorial other then a real game."
170768626,english,0,1128000,"It's not atrocious, just perpetually incomplete.   First, let me get this out of the way: I completely understand why the dev is cutting himself off from others. The sad truth is that he has high anxiety, and he started working this when the internet culture hit peak levels of bad. He really needs to take some notes from Hello Games, and how they made their customers happy, but the sad fact is, he has basically left this game undone and probably walked off with money.  I honestly only tried this game to see what the complaints were all about. Turns out, the complaints are overwhelmingly true."
193428262,english,1,1128000,"There is almost endless possibilities to this game, if your done one biome then go to another. There are artifacts, ranks for weapons and armor (stars) and also many enemies you can find. Whether they are natural, or from different biomes, or even from tribes and kingdoms! In Cube World you will never be bored with the endless possibilities ahead of you."

Growing up watching and wanting the chance to play this game and now finally buying it on steam has to have been the biggest disappointment I've had when buying a game. I held my hopes high and I've checked the developer's twitter which seemingly is still active and is apparently in the process of reworking the game in unreal 5 so there is hope but seeing as he isn't updating the ****show that is Cube World now the worry that this version is abandoned is possible.   If you are another lost soul searching for nostalgia of a game you watched/played when you were younger it isn't worth the price tag even at 20 dollars and is just you throwing your money away. Go play Veloren it's free and actually being actively updated by community devs while still also being janky asf. Goodluck."

This is probably one of my opinions nobody likes but I will say I do like the region locks, why? Well because the game can’t be completed as fast and makes it take longer which I like. I never did get to play the alpha so that could be why I don’t have too much hate for this game.  I don’t really care what some of you guys will think but it’s still good for me."

But I've kept tabs on the game, site and twitters since then waiting for it to come back to be available for purchase. I was a bit disappointed with the new direction of the game but it still is entertaining. I know its been really rough for you with the initial release and the problems surrounding it and the steam release as well but if possible i really do hope that you stick with this and continue to develop it!

183156817,english,0,1128000,"What can I say...  A decade ago I played and loved the alpha for endless hours.  When it was announced that Cube World would be developed further, I was beside myself with joy and waited for years for the full version to be released.  But unfortunately everything turned out very differently.  Instead of leaving the game as it was and simply improving existing features (more skills, more classes, expanding crafting, mining and placing blocks, etc.), the basic principle behind the game was changed.  Originally you leveled up by gaining XP from killing enemies, but in the full version levels are determined by how many artifacts a player has collected.  Artifacts are obtained through dungeons, bosses and treasures and give minor buffs. Another strange change is that the skill tree has been removed and skills like Riding, Gliding and Sailing are now completely tied to equipment that you have to find in a region to unlock the skill instead of getting it through the skill tree. Also, this equipment is region-bound, meaning that if you leave a region, you lose it (glider, boat, etc.) and have to find it again in the new region. For me and probably many others, the change to the game is a very disappointing change. We liked the game the way it was, so why change it?  [Summary] The gameplay of the alpha version was changed in the full version  Alpha: - Level up through XP grinding by killing enemies - Unlock and improve skills by leveling up  Full version: - Level up by collecting artifacts - Skill tree has been removed - Some Abilities (Riding, Gliding, Sailing etc.) is bound to gear instead of gaining it through the skill tree - Gear for Abilities like Riding, Gliding, Sailing etc. is region-bound and needs to be found again for every new region   It's sad, but I'd rather play the alpha version than the full version of the game. The developer is apparently working on a new version and I can only hope that he listens to the feedback from the community. Unfortunately, I would not recommend the game in its current state."

58472813,english,0,1128000,"Nostalgia really got me to buy this game, but the fact that your progress on the character resets after you get to a new biome got me to not play this game anymore sadly. They had a level-up system in their first release of the game some years ago which was a really nice feature and you got a feeling of progression which you don't get in this game at it's state.   If they were to add a level-up system and not a reset in progress upon entering other biomes, i'd play this again."

I was, of course, playing the alpha build of the game,. Hundreds of hours of gameplay and I was still finding tings completely new to me. I remember freaking out the first time I ever found a portal. I was mind blown. I was amazed. I had absolutely fallen for this game. It became a ritual of mine to search online forums and social media for any trace of the game, and its future updates.   This is one of my all time favorite games. But not like this. Not in this state. This ""completed"" Cube World is nothing at all like what I spent countless hours on. I do NOT recommend this version of Cube World. The only reason I purchased and kept the game was to try to pay Wollay back for the enjoyment I received from the alpha build. Seeing this game in the state it is now leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, and I will forever be heartbroken for what Wollay has done do his beaitufl creation.  All that being said, if anyone wants the alpha build of the game, I am more than willing to share with you on Google Drive. I would recommend Alpha 1000x before this full release. Since the game is ""completed"" now, and the alpha version is lost to time, the only way to receive it is to either pirate it or have it shared. If anyone wants to try the alpha version, email me at the following:  AEROGON123@GMAIL.COM"

No Level up system, region lock items, no enemy level scaling, no skill tree. They completely killed the awesome progression the game had and the feeling to explore the world. I would like to know from the dev if he really thought that region locking items would be a good move and everyone would like it. This game completely sucks at its current state, you don't even have a motivation to move to another region and explore the map. It's completely dumb the way items and equipment work now. I played the alpha version till lvl 365 and now I can't even play one hour straight without ragin the entire system. Just don't buy it. For you Wolfram, just add mod support and let the community fix your game :)  In the end, I just wanted to play the old Cube World again..."

89728595,english,0,1128000,"[For anyone who played Alpha/Beta]. Review given on 4-4-2021. In short: Do not recommend to buy this game BEFORE 2022 as some people claim the developer is still working on this game(If that even is true?).  My review: Remember the skill tree? GONE Remember the proper item crafting? GONE Remember the farming system where you had to find certain characters to get items? GONE  I [b]LOVED[/b] the Alpha and beta. If you see the game and are wishing to still try it out. Don't, its a different game now. Whats new: - No leveling/skill tree, just plain skill (exept for the first hour since EVERYTHING can kill you untill you find at minimum 1 legendary item) - Items are just farming a region. Take a biome of minecraft in mind and take that size, thats ur play size. If you get a FULL legendary set, it's [b]LITERALLY[/b] useless, since everything that is legendary in THAT specific region is BASIC in another region/biome. Once you find 1 or 2 legendary items, you can kill anything so it's creating boring fights. This means in EVERY biome, you must basically START OVER (Stats change the moment u enter the biome or go back). This is basically a run, farm and then do it over again, there is NO progress to be done if you are finished with farming items.   As much as i wanted to feel the nostalgia and was thinking: ""It can't be THAT bad, it's probably still a fun game"". Believe the other people. Oh, and they removed the nice dungeons that went down in the ground.  Feel sad that i figured out the game is more dead then i imagined.. :("

The region locking mechanic and the slow start (hour or two of just running around, hoping you can find a piece of equipment that allows you to actually do something), make the game excruciatingly boring. Then, after you swap regions, you have to do it all again. It's tedious, boring, and insanely grindy. Not to mention, the long term rewards you get are useless, since the stuff it goes towards gets taken away from you each region anyways.  Modders are the only hope this game has, as the developers have gone ghost again, and haven't given any updates since launch."

Your game was amazing, the idea was great, I played this game for hours and hours (Even tho it says only 0,7 hours registered, y'all know what I mean) and I had a blast with friends, solo, or however.  Please if you're not going to keep this game up, take it down from the shop so people don't feel scammed anymore with your unfinished product.   Cheers and love, a fan making a review"

156663257,english,0,1128000,"this game quiet literally said ""lemme remove all the shit that made this game good in alpha and release that as the full game with no explanation"""
55889930,english,0,1128000,"Sorry Wollay, I tried.   I tried so damn hard to make something positive out of this game for 24 hours of gameplay here, and i bet my left buttcheek 100+ on the alpha, and failed.   Cube world, created by a German company Picroma, was a spin-off to Minecraft back in 2011-2012 when cube games where the stuff, and open world random-gen sandboxes thrived both singleplayer-wise and multiplayer-wise.  After about 2 months of sales of the alpha on Picroma's website, the site has been overloaded by a supposed DDoS attack on the store, making the game unpurchasable and traumatising one of the developers to hide for 6 years with only two windows on the outside world: Their Twitter accounts.  For six years, every month or so, Wolay or Pixxie were to drop in a sneak peek of what is to come to the game, the Harps, new enemies, new dungeons or quest systems, many things! How hyped we have been since we got each piece of the puzzle!  Wollay and Pixxie pretty much has created a cult out of the fanbase, waiting for their messiah to give them a lesson in their religion. And as every cult, not every one was satisfied with a prayer or a teaching... we had extremists.  People literally have sent the guy hate mails, threats, hate comments, sadly not every fan was over 15 at the time... Me neither lol, But i'd never send something  like that to a talented guy.  Critique sent to Wollay did not have much response, but was enough to create an unofficial discord, were people rallied to help the guy out and send him some more deserved motivation by sending a smiley or some stuff...   off to the game now:  Six years since then has passed, and I ahve been greeted by a GIGANTIC steam advert that CUBEWORLD is COMING OUT. THIS SEPTEMBER. OH. MY. GOD.  2012 kiddo has been revived in my soul, and went to an override.  Cubeworld on an updated version of the engine, with new stuff, new adventures... MUSIC (ThANK GOD! This game was a mute back then!) and an ability to play with friends via steam!  Then you input your hard-earned (or hard saved) bucks on the title, you downlaod it... (200MB! HAH) And run it! You are greeted by a blue fog of war, the classic in that universe, the engine after 6 years still can't comprehend rendering....  Okay, not bad! you are in the game, made yourself the water mage (Like the ol'school days) Aaaand you get greeted by the unknown.  Mechanics have changed.  -there is no skills anymore, everything is unlocked since the beginning. -money is different, each enemy drops a coin or two, no matter what tier. -there is no XP anymore, just the wierd artifacts with permanent movement buffs (which are utterly useless, I don't want +1% swim speed) villages feel uglier than before, instead of nice, pastel coloured cities we have villages now, soviet-russia grade.   and here goes the fun part...  *cricket noises*  Oh yeah. THERE AINT ANY!  You don't really progress your character, except the artifact unlocks, which are hidden inside a top-tier dungeon in every region.  Oh. Yeah. Remeber that sword you have dropped on the way? or the boat you havefound after 20 minutes of walking and 30 minutes of respawning back in the latest respawn point?   ITS GONE AFTER YOU CROSS THE BORDER OF THE REGION!  Yep. Tools disappear, you in two oceans regions? Nuh uh, magic border-patrol locks your boat back in the region it came from!  TL;DR: game has lost it's golden nuggets, and decided to paint droplets of crap with a golden spraypaint. And Wollay?  He's out. And as much as I am sad,  I hope he won't come back to CubeWorld. Not even with an update.  You broke too much my man."
79175447,english,1,1128000,"Its a fun game but its a joke compared to the Alpha version of this game. If the developers didn't touch the game and just released it when it was in Alpha it would've been 100x better. Unfortunately they changed a lot of stuff that made the game worse. The game is still fun just seriously downgraded. Its a shame that its in this state, I really hope that the devs bring back the old version of the game and use that instead of this version.  You should buy this game if you're either bored or if its on sale.  Here's some Alpha gameplay.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QNU2REynjA&ab_channel=Haxzer  Here's a review for the game that shows what specifically happened to it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAm3sFRqJLI&ab_channel=ProbablyJacob"
92080681,english,1,1128000,"TLDR: Don't play if you're a beta user - it's not going to fill the gap in your heart. If you have no prior experience with Cube World, give it a shot.  Okay, so first of all something needs to be clarified. Most of the negative reviews are from people who played the game back in the early alpha/beta stages and miss the mechanics designed back then.   The game is fairly good, my wife and I had a great time playing it together, albeit somewhat simpler in its current form than those complaining desire. I would encourage you to come to it with an open mind, and remember that it is only for $20.   Pros: -The game feels great to explore in, similar to minecraft. The world is breathtakingly beautiful even though it's simple voxels.  -The pets are cute and finding them and giving them the right food feels great.  -Enemies are challenging in each section until you get decent gear, and you have to re-gear in each zone. (This becomes monotonous after more than 2 zones.) -Co-op. -Certain quests feel rewarding (such as saving a village which is petrified.)  Cons: -Re-gearing in new zones can be frustrating. -20 hours or less, even with the massive world. -Most quests begin to feel like repeats, and lack decent rewards. -Entering a new area forces you to find new lassos/gliders/flutes etc. Losing these items reminds you how crucial they are and can be irritating.  There are four classes, each with their own weapons/style. I recommend water mage for newbies - healing is very helpful early on. (You change your subclass in a village.)   It's certainly not a bad game, especially for the price."
187755467,english,0,1128000,"Played the og. Was waiting for YEARS for it to release. Finally did, and Woolay abandoned it.  Gameplay loop is crap. You farm and farm and farm for gear, go to a new area and suddenly your gear is utterly useless.  It's cute, and I was really hoping for the game to actually be fully fleshed out, have constant updates etc etc but no. Woolay has gone dark since the release. So many other solo indie devs that communicate with their fans and add updates. Shame Woolay isn't one of them."
67456249,english,0,1128000,No support from sole dev.  He really messed up a fun game and then disappeared.  Seems like a quick money grab.  Dont buy unless he comes back and fixes it.
190410025,english,0,1128000,"Such a disappointment. I still think about this game, and even consider going back sometimes, and I’m always immediately reminded why I never should. A absolutely atrocious progression system completely ruins the experience of this game. Everything you do feels pointless because once you leave your current zone, all of your progress is completely wiped away. I hope one day the developer comes back and tries something new with this, because there is so much lost potential here."
92385282,english,0,1128000,"EDIT: Wollay is now working on a new update called Cube World Omega. The new additions and returning Alpha elements sound very promising. I'm looking forward to seeing what he has in store for us. Despite my harsh criticism I do enjoy Cube World and want both it and Wollay to succeed. I will post a new review once this next major update is out. Fingers crossed and good luck Wollay.  Even with a copious amount of mods to fix some of the biggest issues, this is one of the biggest disappointments I have ever purchased and experienced. Wollay dropped the ball hard and the only person he can blame is himself. Turning his back on the community doomed this game. Several straight up boneheaded decisions like region locking items and horrible excuses for progression sucked all the fun out of this simple but charming game. If you are at all interested in this game, go play the alpha from 2013. It is much more fun and rewarding than this boring and frustrating experience. Hopefully Wollay will eventually fix and atone for his mistake and take responsibility. He needs to take the feedback and feelings of the community seriously instead of running away with his tail between his legs again."

I started playing for a bit but it felt different. So, I searched online what happened... All I'm going to say if you're reading this. There is still hope out there for you and this project.

If you really want this game go for it, but don't buy it at normal price ( since its clearly overpriced) and 1st check when the last update was made, if it hasn't been touched  since released chances are it wont be touched for another 6 years ( time is heavily dependent on how long the money he made lasts)."
144198815,english,0,1128000,"Before this game came to Steam, and before the major update that took the developers 20 years to release, this game was worth every penny. Sure, it had it glitches and bugs, but it was a game in-development. Now, I believe that saying this game is still under development is a tragic understatement. Before the update, you didn't have to worry about your weapons and armor no longer being effective because you went to a new area on the map. While fighting was challenging, it was not impossible, and you could actually kill stuff. Remember when you would kill something and get experience for it? For some reason, that was taken out, eliminating one of the biggest ways to level up. Now, the only way you can level up is accepting quests that will take you to incredibly difficult dungeons that are so far up the leveling scale, you'd have to be hopelessly addicted to this game just to attempt to be high enough level to take those dungeons on. The mages are still OP as hell, you can no longer buy the gliders and boats from the shops, you now have to go and FIND them. Characters you create are now tied to their own worlds, so you can no longer create your own worlds. Finding gear for your character's class is hopelessly rare, whereas before the update you could just find a landmark, drop the gear you couldn't use, hop onto another character that could use that gear, go to that landmark, and give that character that gear. Not anymore. There isn't even a mailing system where you could send stuff to another character of yours.  Don't waste your money on a game that only got worse after a major update the devs spent too long to release. This game was amazing once, now it's just a hopeless grind with OP enemies, and crappy leveling. How I wish there was a pre-update version of this game. But, just like with everything else we were hoping to see in the new update: it'll never happen."
55469836,english,0,1128000,"If you're thinking of buying this because of seeing videos of Alpha gameplay, don't, it's entirely different and almost nothing like the Alpha. It's essentially just running around trying to figure out what to do for 2 hours, before finally realizing you need to do quests to do anything at all, realizing you need to cheese every boss or have extremely over the top gear from cheesing a high level enemy, and then losing everything you've gained the moment you travel too far. Just save your money until it's fixed, which it most likely wont be."
55417625,english,0,1128000,"man i want to like this game so bad.... after finishing the first zone, I was having a blast. Then I left that zone. Everything gone except for a useless ""artifact"" that only made my lamp shine a little brighter.  I'm sorry but the alpha had more content then the game does right now. Before there was much more to do with an exp system (not to mention the oceans are literally EMPTY husks. Before there were fish, now there's seemingly NOTHING in there)  Its depressing what happened to this game. I honestly hope it's an experimental release or something along those lines. All those years just to have my expectations(which honestly if he just added some needed changes to the old game, I would have been fine with) completely shattered. I know this sounds like a self centered review but this is just how I feel about it. It's not what I played a couple years ago. :/  Not to mention, every zone your practically doing the same thing over and over, just with a different name and zone look. No variety."
55407632,english,0,1128000,"The alpha is an absolutely lovely charming skill based exploration game that I sunk countless hours into.  The release is not.   Skill trees, abilities and the sense of progression have been removed. The game to me is unplayable and joyless.  I am very tempted to refund the game but I am hoping that Wolfram can come back from the ether he has disappeared into, show some signs of life, speak up and see the criticisms.  Please fix this burning pile of a game."
109349492,english,1,1128000,"On It's own the game is a shadow of it's former alpha. But with mods slightly tweaking the games core, it can turn into an adventure that no other game can give you. There's plenty of open world space, fun fights, awesome loot. Overall a very good experience."
118979516,english,1,1128000,"I will recommend with one large asterisk: play with mods. I did try it without mods first and knew beforehand what I was getting into because I did some research on the game. I never played the alpha but it seems most preferred the game in that state. Without mods there is no leveling and you are more or less restricted to a zone because of the way gear works. Yes, you can explore to your heart's content, however it is nearly fruitless because you can explore and get your gear worked up pretty nicely in zone X only for it to become useless in any other one.  The mods I have used (I found them posted in the discuss section) reintroduced leveling and a host of other things that were apparently supposed to be in the finished game. Gear is still lightly tied to zones and will suffer a downgrade when entering a new area but it doesn't become completely useless.  It is a fun game but I suspect if you aren't very interested in modding your games you will likely become bored because of stark limitations of gameplay. It is also pretty tough and you will probably have to grind out very weak mobs to get at least a couple levels before being able to do much like craft some armor and a better weapon. I haven't been using guides or anything but as a mage I found I can cheese quite a bit by staying on tree tops and using magic. Doesn't work 100% of the time as some enemy projectiles (and your own magic) can break foliage and leave you tumbling to the ground if you aren't careful. You can almost fly (better than using a Hang Glider you find) by using your float ability: jump, hit float, then rapidly tap it as you sail in a direction you want. It keeps you fairly horizontal in the direction you wish to go.  Been having some fun with it even though it really does require some mods to get longevity out of it."
191086850,english,1,1128000,"Cube World is a decent game in its current state, but man it could have been so much more. I remember playing the alpha years ago and being super hyped for a full release. The current state of the game with its zone locking shenanigans makes it fun for the first handful of hours, but when you begin going to new zones and have your good gear suddenly become worthless it kinda loses steam. I really wish Wollay stuck around through all the backlash and really polished this game up to perfection À la No Man's Sky. The only other game that comes close to Cube World's style is Trove, but Trove is an MMO and doesn't really play the same. I wish steam had a option for leaving a mixed review for games like this."
150385841,english,0,1128000,"I loved the progression in one area, slowly getting stronger, but going to a new area and being instantly back to 0? It made it feel like i wasted my time."
121553204,english,0,1128000,"Abandoned Game. A shame really.  Dev took the money and ran, which is really sad since this clearly had potential. Its not like its a bad game, but people waited 6 Years for this after the Alpha released 2013, only to get a game that is arguably less finished than before somehow.   They completely scrapped the well liked Progression System from the Alpha of the Game. Instead we now have essentially region locked gear and levels. When you leave the Area you got your gear from, it downgrades it to abyssmal stats, making it unusable. As you can guess, this is a very... questionable feature in a Game with infinite world generation.   A lot of the stuff the Dev of this game promised and teased is simply not in the game.  Im talking big cities, certain kinds of dungeons, skilltrees etc.  You know, the good stuff people actually wanted.  Furthermore, you`ll need a playlist. Since the music in this game, while not sounding bad at first, starts giving you a headache after around ~30mins. Every song sounds the same with slight changes or one different instument. It just gets on your nerves after a while.  If you plan on playing this in Multiplayer, i have bad news for you.  It simply doesnt work. Desyncs, random disconnects, people not showing up despite being online, friends not being able to join for no reason etc.  Big servers with 100+ people like back in the Alpha are not a thing anymore. Gone are the days of 30 People teaming up to kill a +4 Legendary monster.   As you can guess from this review, i am really dissapointed.  Especially since this could have been amazing if the Dev just expanded on the already successfull Alpha.   This is a perfect example of: ""If it aint broke, dont fix it."" Overall: 2/10  Rather play the unfinished Alpha."
64326307,english,0,1128000,"I enjoy my time playing Cube World. I think for the first couple hours you have a character and you are learning, or relearning the game, is a real treat, but after you've done your first region it just goes downhill from there. I feel like I'm speed-running the next couple regions. I ask myself ""why am I subjecting myself to this boredom and displeasure?"" so I stop playing. But somehow it seems the I'm always drawn back. I think if you were there for the hype of the game; you should buy it just to see what it really is lie for yourself, but if you are totally new to the game; don't buy it. It will only cause you to be frustrated and hate the game."
88814778,english,0,1128000,"This game had potential, but the developer is a complete diva who throws online tantrums. This game suffered at his hands the way minecraft did with Notch; an overly controlling entrepreneur who wants to produce THEIR vision. There are new systems that drain the fun from the game. The cool generated castles and dungeons are gone. NPC's spout one of half a dozen madlib phrases. ""I'm going to be the greatest <class> in the land!"" Good for you, you wafer thin attempt at content!  Lets talk about the elephant in the room: per-land gear. This has to be one of the least well thought out ways to artificially stretch the content out. Gear crafting allows you to add a voxel to your weapon, but the crafting has all the depth of a teaspoon.  This should be my favorite game ever. As a minecraft, zelda and d&d player this is like the venn diagram intersection! The formula is gold, as proven by the alpha! But the poor choices in the games design are astoundingly dumb, and turn this into a waste of money. I really hope this gets sold to a professional developer, or is saved by mods, but I'm not holding my breath."
114816851,english,1,1128000,"I'm not gonna say that this game is the greatest game of all time, far from it. but for only like two developers, this is pretty good. Alpha was probably a few steps in the right direction farther then this, but this isn't bad if you remove the region locking problem (can be fixed with mods). Its worth a good 10-15 hours of fun playtime (would be much longer without region locking), and I think at a discount this game is worth buying. Also contrary to popular belief, I think the dev is still working on the game."

55402227,english,1,1128000,"Hey, after 6 years of silent, we actually get to play Cube World. And I'll be honest. I enjoyed it. Even though I recommended Cube World, I'm not saying this game didn't have a flaw, it's a big one as well. But let go over the good thing I found first. + The environment is great. Everything look very lively and colorful, making exploring alone fun and enjoyable. + The game greatly present exploring. The more you explore the stronger you become, but that doesn't mean you would become overpower, as you explore more zone, the more adaptive the game become. As you can't use the same gear in another zone (Not including Plus Gear of course) you need to explore more if you want to get stronger, which allow you to explore even more terrain. + The artifact is very interesting, to actually level up, you need to explore. Gathering as much information as possible to locate the artifact. The artifact as a concept act more like a treasure hunt rather than a progression.  Now that we're done with the pros, now for the flaws. - The game is very unbalance. When you start the game, you will die a lot, as most monster actually one shot you if you get too close, and fighting against range enemy at first feel like hell, especially mages as their move are strong as hell. If you challenge a strong enemy at first. You do not stand a chance. But once you get rarer gear, it only get much more powerful the more you go. Even you yourself is unbalance, some skills is actually hella broken. The example of this is Ranger Scout Subclass Ultimate. The quicksands is so strong as the move slow the enemy, let them take more damage, and have hilariously low cooldown of 40 seconds, and the cooldown actually start when you activate the ability, not when it disappear. You can actually beat a level 5 melee boss with the starter gear by abusing this skill. And that just cheating. - The game is lacking motivation, once you get stronger gear, you become too powerful in that zone, but once you change area, your gear immediately become useless, being weaker than a level 1 gear in that zone. Seeing this, most people get discourage about exploring, and just play in that area until they're bored and stop playing. The artifact, even if it fun to find it, still doesn't have enough impact to make people think exploring is important. - This is the biggest flaws of the game, it's very repetitive. There are difference between repetitive and replayable, and Cube World lean into repetitive rather than replayable. Each time you explore into different area, you are having a different experience, but it's the same, you make a gear, fight something until you get better gear, get the best gear, beat all the dungeons and quest in that area, get information for artifact, then change area. And you do that everytime, and yes, there is something different each time, but the main thing is always the same.  Looking at my review, you may think the game isn't fun. But you need to try it. The game may miss progression and motivation, but the game is enjoyable, everything pros blend in together perfectly and with a little more love and care, this game can clearly be a masterpiece. And hey, maybe this will be another no man sky fiasco, who know?  In Conclusion, This game may not be the best. But you cannot find any experience like it anymore. You may enjoy it or not, but that doesn't stop this game from being fun. I encourage everyone to pick up the game and try it for themselves. If you enjoy it, great! If not, well, leave a review!"

55516502,english,0,1128000,"Basically everything it was good for was removed, and most of the stuff shown during development - not added. This game is a good example of what happens when you don't communicate with the people who follow the development as much, basically making the game alone and not even testing it.

55452432,english,1,1128000,"If you have never played a previous version of Cube World before, please read this review:  The reason the reviews are mixed as of now is because a lot of players who played Cube World in the alpha version are unhappy at the state of the game at release. This is because the level progression system changed since alpha, as well as other game-changing factors. Ultimately, their expectations were high then suddenly dropped.  Now let me review this game as somebody who has never played Cube World prior to my purchase 3 days ago:  This game does have an interesting leveling system - yes. Each region contains at least one artifact that you get through exploring the region, talking to people and obtaining better gear. This artifact gives you a slight upgrade to something. This is your level progression. Most gear doesnt transfer  over to other regions meaning you have to start the grind all over again. To me, this is a lot of fun. I enjoy the unique system this game follows. This system definitely is not for everyone though.   Another aspect of the game I enjoy is the exploration. Exploration is forced, but thats what you would expect from an open world, adventure game. The exploration in this game in my opinion is done so well that I never get bored wandering around. I could do so for hours. The adventure and scenery in this game gives it a truly magical appeal that puts me in a positive mood. Not to mention this game has the best map function I have ever witnessed in a game.   To conclude, this game is a magical experience full of superlative adventure and hours of content. The level system is different, but not difficult to get used to. As off-putting as most reviews for this game are, try not to let that change your viewpoint on the game, since a lot are biased towards a previous version. As somebody playing this game for the first time, I absolutely recommend this game if you are looking for an exciting adventure."

61774691,english,1,1128000,"I need to preface this with the following; unmodded, Cube World is awful. But installing the mods required to fix the progression system is incredibly easy, which results in an infinitely superior experience.  The lack of a proper XP system was a bit of a let down at first, but having experienced the progression at its best, I can safely say I'm fine with it. Early game is hell but once you start accumulating power, shit hits the fan fast. Exploration is entertaining and satisfying, though the whole map being revealed from the start is a puzzling decision. The relic system is cool as well and combos effectively with the various stats your gear can grant, and the payoff for the lore is entertaining. Without region lock and with proper progression scaling as you move further away from where you started, Cube World is everything I'd hoped it would be. These two small changes fix the game in so many ways and the resulting experience is, IMO, a ton of fun.  Now for stuff that applies to the base game. Dungeons are fun to explore, enemy variety is extremely good and solid, and the landscapes are absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. My only complaints is, again, the whole map being revealed; it should reveal itself as you explore more segments of the world.  Make no mistake, the developer goofed hard, but the effort of the community to make it better makes it worth a buy in my honest opinion."
165255405,english,0,1128000,"I've wanted to enjoy this so bad since it launched on steam but it's just so annoyingly bad.  For starters, there is no clear cut leveling system. All of your stats are tied to your gear that you find/craft. There's no experience points and no abilities or talents to work towards unlocking. The latter isn't necessarily bad, but having access to all your class abilities from the start is slightly boring. It's an RPG with no skills to unlock. it feels weird.  The enemy scaling is terrible. You could start a new character, see some bugs in the distance you think you can take on and then be dead 10 seconds after attacking them.   Your gear is region locked. If you enter a new zone you have to re-obtain special equipment (boat, glider, etc.) for that zone and all of your gear gets downgraded. Did you spend a long time obtaining/crafting the best gear you could? Better get ready to do it all over again cause it will be useless if you enter a new region! And because your stats are tied to your gear (since there's no exp based leveling system) you're basically level 1 when you enter a new region!  Traveling becomes kind of annoying after a while. You will either need to find and tame a ride-able pet to speed you up or spend gold on flight paths.  Good luck trying to progress if its night time in game. This game is so unreasonably dark you cannot see anything. Your lantern does not provide enough light. Oh, and there is no brightness setting to crank up to get around this issue. So there's that.  Word gen customization. In the Alpha version of the game you could enter custom seeds for your world generation which was neat. That feature is gone now in this version. There aren't even world slots for you to use. It just assigns a world to your character and that's that.  This game had such potential to be amazing. A lot of people loved the alpha release, but the developer took so many steps in the wrong direction with this.  Don't buy the game. Not worth it unless the dev comes back from the dead to finish it. If you really want to play it though, make sure you mod it. I recommend trying CubeMegaMod. It's one of the few mods that are still compatible with the game."

However I must say I just cannot play it in its current state.  In the 27 minutes I played, my character was chased by red blobs that shot water, a Skull Bull, three giants and a golem. I fought everything I could but just died each time. The game also just....feels no different than the alpha. Hell, the alpha was better and more polished than this is to me. The game feels like you're supposed to fail. The first thing to get; the Glider, was in the middle of a volcano and no matter what I tried I just KEPT dying. Nothing stopped it. I could never get out to it. The animations are unchanged even though there are claims they are polished, and it just feels like a messy game release. We know you needed money back on this investment you made Wollay, but this feels lazy.....  Can I pet dogs? yes. Horses? Yeah. Pigs? Sheep? Cows? YES But can I enjoy myself with any other part of this game at this point? No.  All in all, just wait till it gets updates and patches. Its current state should be listed as a WIP or alpha. Early Access. Anything other than listed as a FINISHED game. Cause its not."
134838204,english,0,1128000,"If you really wanna play this go find the original alpha version online and download it for free. A lot of the best mechanics from the original game were left in the past and the TWO people that develop this game have, as far as we can tell over the years pretty much abandoned it. So much promise for nothing in the end"
55856264,english,1,1128000,"Deary me. Here goes. When this game was first released in 2013, together with an unbelievable amount of other blocky voxel games that have been indubitably inspired by the success of Minecraft, I was in my teens. Not having had any means of online payment, I didn't purchase it back then, though I was still moderately hyped from watching some YouTube creators playing it with their mates.   Due to this, I haven't had much in the way of expectations. I didn't know what I was getting, I didn't remember how good it has been. When it was announced that, after six years of development hell, it will be released, I was hyped which is why I got it on Day 1.   First impression... Well, you're not being told anything at all about the mechanics. A player needs to find out everything by themselves, trial and error, due to the lack of a tutorial. Would have been nice to include one.  After having found out about the basics of the game, I encountered the first feature which I immediately disliked. The vast majority of the obtainable items are locked to the region you picked them up in. It would appear that this is a product of the missing progression system. Progression is gathering all items, finishing all mission, completing every dungeon in one region, and start over in the next one. Probably not the best approach. Mages. F*ck mages. They are terribly overpowered. They hard-lock onto your sorry rear and frag you.   After doing some research, I of course found out that there are quite a few features missing from the original, making people rather unhappy, which is understandable. The ""low"" quality of the game is surely a by-product of Wollay's isolation during those six years. The community couldn't give any advice, recommendations, feature requests, etc., of course it isn't exactly what everybody wanted. Those issues can only be sorted out now. We also won't get any updates in the near future, since Wollay has gone MIA, probably dealing with PTSD. I'm certainly worried about him. All the best to Wollay. Concerning the accusations that ""Hur dur dur Wollay has scammed us!""... Are you serious?!?!?! I refuse to believe that this is the sole purpose of this game.  The game needs a few fixes and changes here and there. Some members of the community have made that quite clear, some have been quite toxic while doing that. Not really the best behaviour.  At any rate... I still like this game! It's fun, even if some others have been spoilt by and arguably better version and hence had higher expectations.  [Edit 31-10-19: Minor wording adjustments]"
96321733,english,0,1128000,The person just stopped making it after everyone hated the new version. Pulled something worse than EA games
85847129,english,1,1128000,this game is good if you use mod fixes. the mod makes it super fun all though we shouldnt have had to mod it ourselves.
68029646,english,1,1128000,"I expected to be able to sink as many hours into the game as I did in the Alpha version - unfortunately the region locking has led to my disillusionment with the game and to my choosing to uninstall it after 36 hours.  Simply put, the first two or three regions are fine, fun, fantastic - the discovery elements are great, the combat is solid as the Alpha was, and the pets meant I never felt completely alone despite playing exclusively in singleplayer.  Having gotten ""+ items"" early on, I had no issue with the regions surrounding my initial one, rapidly acquiring the gimmicks that locked content in these new regions (whistle, flute, bell, etc.). However, my enjoyment peaked there due to my losing all progress in the next region, which greatly disheartened me.  I believe there's a mod floating around somewhere (Reddit iirc) that disables the region-lock for reins, gliders, and boats, so I could probably get a bunch more enjoyment out of this game - but I'm in no hurry and I expect I'll revisit it at some point in the future.  With all this said, the base game is still incredibly fun and entertaining - one need only watch some gameplay on YouTube to see how fluid the game is, and in-person one can easily experience all the game has to offer in 2 hours. The main glaring issue remains the region-locking which broke my immersion and ended up making me shun the game, but perhaps others might not be as put off by this as me."
55545463,english,1,1128000,"Wall of text warning, this is getting long!  Honestly, I am having a lot of fun with this game! There is a lot more to it than many would have you believe. And, since I know this is going to be the first question a bunch of you ask, I did play Alpha. And, I like this better.   This is a game that has been designed with two goals in mind, endless adventure and seamless multiplayer, and the systems reflect that. It also seems to reward those who are not in a hurry and spend time gathering crafting ingredients, hunting non-boss mobs, and just generally enjoying the ride. It's not about the destination, if you play it with that mindset you will be very disappointed.  It's a lot of fun to just chill, relax, and adventure, however.  The gear is region-locked, meaning that when you enter a new ""region"" your gear becomes white (drop down to the first tier of gear), and you must find travel gear (boats, hang-gliders, and the like) again. You don't actually lose the old ones, they just don't work for the new region. Your gear also retains it's old properties if you ever want to return to where it's valid again (there is actually a good reason to do this). It even has it's own pages, navigable at the bottom of the inventory screen, to keep it separated from your current region. You may not want to sell your old region gear just yet.  Really, this is not that big a deal to me, and necessary to keep the game from becoming stale. You don't actually completely start over ""at square one"" when the gear resets, you still have all your potions and crafting ingredients, money, pets, and potentially + gear (gear that retains it's bonuses in larger multi-region areas so that it's useful longer). You have more than enough to really make a good start in the new region, and I don't personally find it feels like a whole new character.  Also, NPCs in the new regions still really like my old boots.  What this does do, however, is makes the content in this new region valid. There was this problem that I, and others, found in the Cube World Alpha progression system (similar issues happen in most progression systems if you try to extend them very far), and that was eventually (I found it didn't take all that long) your gear and levels made the game ridiculously easy, and most people just flew around on their hang-gliders looking for dungeons. There were only two main valid locations at that point. Dungeons and towns. This system is in response to issues like that, and has actually been pretty well thought out.  It does feel like a little bit of a let-down when my gear turns white and I am back to killing yard-trash for a while. It would be like this in many other ""normal"" progression systems, too, if you consider that you are now level 15 in a 15-25 region. This is perhaps harder to bear as you have a visible representation in gear color that does feel like you lost something. Still, I know to expect that, and I get the reason.  As mentioned before, + gear exists. This is gear that retains it's qualities in a larger multi-region area (I have seen the dev refer to them as ""Kingdoms"" once, but really don't know much more about them, or how they are defined, it's not obvious in-game). + gear is fairly rare, but after you have completed a region (found all the artifacts) it becomes more common. This is why I say it's a good idea to potentially return to regions you have already completed.  The world is huge. If I understand it right, it is essentially procedurally generated, but we all have the same seed to keep it multiplayer friendly. You start ""somewhere"" in this world and set out from there. It's not, however, like an MMO where you see others and their actions effect your own world. Multiplayer works through the Steam friend system, and you can join your friends in distant regions with free rides from the flight masters.  It is important to understand the difficulty system, and that it matters. There are several colored tiers of gear: white, green, blue, purple, gold. This is probably pretty familiar to many folks from other games. When starting out don't try to take down colored mobs. The quests also are (mostly) colored accordingly (the dungeons seem to register as white, but are not). Your character's current gear is rated similarly, with separate Armor and Weapon ratings. These seem to be pretty accurate indicators of what you can expect to handle, though be mindful of boss mobs. Boss mobs can be scary.  Pay attention to your surroundings. Stronger mobs can be found near weaker ones, but you can usually see them before you wander into them if you are mindful. I was already several hours in before I was killed by something powerful that caught me off-guard, and it seldom happens still.  I find the world is actually much more full than Alpha, though I am sure many would disagree with me. There are many little adventure sites in the wild, ones with mini-bosses and interesting challenges. One theme that seems pretty common is freeing merchant gnomes from things like undead, witches, and necromancers. I may have lucked out in my first region because I have a pile of stuff there, including a couple of Steel Empire airship invasions, and have seen other regions that don't seem nearly that full. Perhaps this is where some of the complaints come from.  Again, if you are the kind of player who likes to crash through content, you probably will want to pass this one by. The quests and challenges can require a bit of footwork to find, talking to villagers, completing other things first, things like that. But, if you are like me, and really like to just get immersed in the world it can be pretty fun. Personally I don't like having everything handed to me on a silver-platter in a nice clean quest-hub or breadcrumb trail. But, I also played EverQuest when it was new and really enjoyed that, as well. I find this easier.  There is no skill tree anymore, and while I don't actually like this, I do understand why the dev would have wanted to remove it. The idea is, I think, that any player can hang with any other player in any region, and this facilitates that goal. It still would have been nice to have potentially a horizontal skill tree, meaning you have access to new abilities, though new abilities that are reasonably balanced with the rest.  This is not to say all mages play the same, or anything like. Each class has a couple of specializations that offer different sets of abilities, and each weapon-type adds more variance to that. Off the top of my head I would say there are 6 ways to play that mage.  The game begins with the whole map revealed, though no details such as town names or quest area names filled in, these you can learn from NPCs or by going there yourself. There are mixed opinions on this since you can spend time inspecting the map to try locate towns and things. I don't mind it, and understand that it is facilitating the multiplayer aspect, as well as the fact you can just say ""I want to go explore a savannah today, let me check my map and catch a flight there.""  Is it a perfect game? No. Is it for everyone? No.  However, if the gameplay I described sounds appealing, and the region locking does not sound like such a harsh thing, it might well be worth trying out. I, and many others, actually like it quite a bit. The reviews on here are a bit skewed as most folks who do like it are scared to review due to the way certain elements in the community react to anything that does not agree with their opinions.  Not saying all the negative opinions are wrong, there are valid arguments, especially giving differing preferred playstyles, and I do agree with some of the criticisms out there. But, there are also people throwing out things like ""It's a scam"", ""The dev is (inset all sorts of nasty things)"", or various other toxic comments. I have also seen several reviews from people that, in my opinion, have not put enough time in to really have a firm grasp of what actually is here."
116164912,english,1,1128000,"Even if some features from the alpha never made it into the release, i still greatly enjoy cube world for what it is, without comparing it to the alpha. I am in favour of the region locking as i'm sure if you kept the best stuff you would just blow through regions with the only challenge coming from the first one. And with the key items, depending on the order you got them you have to traverse the land differently which always keeps things from being the same. Along with the different biomes, structures and dungeons my expectations are always exceeded by some places having completely different designs, especially with the underground places. However, this does not mean i didn't come across a few.. odd things. Graveyard houses with vault doors that require a harp to open only for them to have nothing inside, pillars being in odd places, and many npcs spinning around and on top of cauldrons with gnomes in them, and a few other small things like that. But i think there are so many other great parts of the game that greatly outweigh the bad. so yes i would recommend this game to people, but i would inform them on how it functions to see if the game is really for them. So please, keep on trying, i would love to see some of the things shown like cities and all sorts, if there is ANY hope whatsoever i would love to see this come back better than ever."
120640453,english,0,1128000,"Tbh, quite a disappointment. A lot of the features that were in the early days just scrapped, like dungeons, skills and attributes. It is now just basically a hiking simulator in Voxel graphics.  Don't buy it unless my above statement is incorrect."

The reason I'm writing a positive and recommending you this game in the future is the modders. The modders of Cube World are hopefully going to fix Wollay's disaster making the game like it was in alpha and hopefully add new mechanics themselves. I'd wait about 2-3 more weeks. Either he comes out of hiding or the modders are just gonna fix the game themselves. The game has potential, it's not a bad game. There's many features that need rework and more content added. I will keep my faith more on the modders to make Cube World great again."

55353405,english,0,1128000,"Used to play the Alpha 6 years ago - I loved it. And before I get hate for disliking the new version: please hear me out. I honestly tried to love this game. Only played the new release myself for about half an hour atm, however I have seen countless of gameplay from the Beta. I conclude that in its current state, Cube World is sadly not worth playing.  The difficulty spike in the beginning, which basically forces you to avoid any combat, is not rewarding at all. Additionally, fighting isn't even encouraged as you don't earn XP from it (???). My main concern however is, that in an RPG which heavily focuses on EXPLORATION, you basically lose all your gear upon entering a new zone.  I can partially see what Wollay was trying to achieve with the gameplay style, but it just isn't fun. For me personally at least, and from what I've read many other ""legacy players"" think the same. Really hope that some of the current issues are resolved/changed in the future as I'd really want to recommend and enjoy this game.  I will continue to play this game to see how it evolves when playing it for a longer amount of time. If I change my mind about it, I will update this review accordingly."
55434073,english,1,1128000,"After 34 hours of gameplay and the completion of close to 6 regions, I can safely say that I haven't enjoyed a game this much in years and this is the first game, that I feel deserves my honest review.  First off, the exploration is great, the terrain looks amazing and the points of interest and cities are ususal well spread out making everywhere you go have something to do. There are some quirks in the generation like trees inside plateaus or water rising above the ground levels, but that makes it all the more fun to find and explore.  The combat is... cheesy, especially in the early and sometimes very late game of a region and when playing solo. But I have to say I enjoy it a lot. Finding that edge to make the bosses circle below you, leading them to shrines to quickly respawn, making them repeatedly lose interest in you or letting your friend be the bait. There are many ways to fight them and being creative is the way to go. Fight whichever way you prefer.  Now, the game has gear based progression and region locked gear/items. I've seen many complaints about this, but I don't really see any issues with it. At first glance it looks like it severly limits exploration, but when looking deeper into it, it really promotes detailed exploration within every region. Yes, losing the travel items can be a bit annoying, but once you figure out how to do things, gearing up and advancing in a region can go very quickly. And besides, what's the difference between monsters getting stronger or you getting weaker when moving to the next area? My only complaint is that the artifacts are kind of useless besides just showing them off to friends.  I've played around with the alpha, and I followed wol_lay on twitter for the past years to see how development was going. And I have to agree that, in my opinion, this release did underdeliver considering how long was worked on this game, but whatever the reasons are for this, I'm not blaming wol_lay, it's his project and I think he did an amazing job. Could it be better? Yes, of course, but for €20, this is totally worth it, and if he keeps development up (which we should definitely encourage), maybe this game will even surpass the expectations we had."

Well... coming back to the crushing reality. I wish they had dropped it. We had fun for the first few hours but there wasnt that much more content, they had removed a lot of the stuff we used to love and made the game fun for us. It could've just been a good memory.  We can't change it now, we have this abomination of a ruined game before us and there is nothing to do about it. If we have learned one thing from this experience, then simply not to give Picroma more money.  What a disappointment."
163167641,english,0,1128000,"The game is unfortunately bad. I wanted to like this game, its beautiful cubic world and wildlife, but with so many bad system choices. i cant find enjoyment out of it.   Getting crafting items is a tedious task because i cant find what i need. Every crafting component is scarce, so trying to get into crafting is useless. I would rather have a lot of crafting components across the map and needing a large amount to craft items, than having barley any components and little needed to craft items.  The combat was just bad. i played rouge and tried both the assassin and ninja. found the ninja to be less bad just because of its range attacks. still i found the combat to be a boring hack and slash where you start battles where you and the enemy mindlessly beat on each other until one of you fall.  Progression feels dull. The game has a system where you don't lvl up but you focus on getting better gear. This really isn't in the games favour, because with these different classes i expect to get new abilities as i progress, instead of just using the same abilities with a higher dps number. Having a skill tree would be awesome. This would make me feel like im becoming a better warrior, ninja, etc instead of just getting stronger damage output.  The region system made me absolutely stop playing. When i started the game i did a couple quests to get myself a glider and a boat. i was ready to set out to explore the world and all of a sudden i lost everything. Thats because the game only allow you to use the things you earned in the region it was gained. Imagine if you played breath of the wild and after completing the great plateau and leaving it. You found yourself unable to use the glider or anything until you got the sheikah tower of that region. That is cube world. I expected to get the boat and glider to make future exploration easier but it only does for the region you are in. maybe instead of having it that way. you could make it more like botw where you can get longer stamina, so that you can glide for a longer period. There are so many other ways to balance this better, than to take our stuff away from us.  From what i heard the dev is focusing on a successor that is supposed to take aim at making the alpha version a complete game. My only wish is that the people who bought this game doesn't have to buy the new one as well. This cube world game is not worth its 20 dollars, So i hope cube world omega is either going to be an update to this version or given to the people who bought this cube world for its 20 dollar price."

Yet still, if a game needs mods to be playable, how does that give Picroma any credibility as a developer?  Before I start I'd like to mention that I also was an Alpha player, and this review will be heavily nostalgia-biased.  I remember getting this game 6 years ago. I remember actually playing the Alpha and doing so a lot even before the official release, throughout those 6 years. The info about the release was.. Astounding, and very sudden. It felt like a dream come true. That one, great RPG that was part of my teenhood was great and seeing that it was about to get a full release was great too.  I did not take part in the beta though. I dared to say I wanted to wait for the official release. Damn, I was brave enough to ignore all spoilers, the Reddit and the whole Cube World community so I could get the best experience on release as possible.  Sadly, I was disappointed. I told my friends to purchase the game so we could play multiplayer and that it would be an amazing experience, because the Alpha was great. But we've gone through a bad optimisation issue, Syncing was a pain, and the land generation (should we speak about generation at all actually?) took more than 3 minutes so we could move forward. A ping of ~5000ms was common.  With this, we quit multiplayer. Quite a disappointing outcome. All I saw was an RPG Roguelike becoming... Just a Roguelike. But not that, let me go for some things that I managed to see while playing Singleplayer:  - What first picked my mind when watching the game trailer was the lack of an XP bar. I first thought ""Yeah, that's fine, they probably just hid it somewhere"". Nothing more wrong. When I launched the game, I noticed that experience has gone COMPLETELY, while replacing it with some ""artifacts"". What's more, you'd expect them to incease your stats, but in fact those are some visual, exploration-related bonuses, that are so small you would not even notice.  - Region item lock. Seriously? This game in Alpha used to be about exploration, why is it supposed to punish us, the players, for wanting to explore? In the end I found out that my gameplay stopped at the first region I ended up in, and stuck there with all the equipment. Apparently there are some ""+"" items, that are allowed to be used in surrounding regions, but yet they're extremely rare (~1/50 chance) and not entirely worth the grind.  - Item rarity going from literal rarity to Tierness. You begin from Tier white, while beating stronger enemies and working through these tiers up to the highest, yellow level, defeating the original purpose of RPG and grinding in general.  - The skill tree being removed completely.  - The Hang Glider becoming even more useless now that you cannot increase it's speed like you did in Alpha with skills. Not to mention the terribly high stamina consumption.  - The Water Mage and Warrior are even more broken as ever.  - The Mage's hover literally replaces Climbing.  - The enemy AI is completely braindead at times, especially the bigger enemies, not knowing what to do in front of a single, breakable block.  - Progression tied to either RNG or cheesing abilities, usually the second one though, by abusing the aforementioned braindead AI and the surroundings.  - Some bugs that renders the gameplay kind of... Weird.  - The dev had a literal *week* to collect the Beta testers' opinions. What did we, the actual buyers actually get? As far as I'm aware, the exact same game. I'd love to see an actual delay in the release, if I were to get a more complete product that would actually get listened to the players' opinions and feedback.  - Additionally, most of the things Wollay posted on Twitter as teases for the game were not added in the game at all.  That's just a part of what I noticed so far. Wollay, you deceived us all, Alpha players. We were expecting a great update, with new content, with things that would make our gameplay actually engaging and interesting. The Alpha made us expect a better Alpha, but we actually got another game at all. I'm very disappointed to say, that until most of the issues mentioned above are fixed, I may stick to the original, Alpha version.  I do not mean any hate towards Wollay and his work. He did his best to give us the best Cube World experience possible, but I do not understand his way of handling this proces. I am sadly anxious about the future of this game, as no word of his took place after release. Either he just published and panicked due to the negativity or ran away with the money. Either way, we're dealing with an unprofessional dev, and I hope for the best.   Tl;dr A game that did not live up to its expectations, and a dev not having any contact with it's players. Not satisfied, if you're an alpha player, do not buy at all, if you're new, get it when a discount happens."
185127712,english,0,1128000,Game is completely abandoned and will most likely never be finished.
121875437,english,0,1128000,"The Older this games gets, the worse the reviews are going to get. This game had infinite potential and the game was abandoned twice because the creator couldn't handle criticism. And it only gets worse because the second time he made promises, and it was no longer this fun side project, and when it didn't have everything it originally had and asking alpha players to rebuy the game for a larger price point effectively scammed thousands and thousands of people. I don't have hope for this game coming back.  The game can be fun with mods, removing alot of the issues, but at that point some of the mechanics you are still playing a worse version then the alpha, and because there is definitely gonna be no future content, there still isnt much of a point."
123192628,english,0,1128000,"I love Wallay's work, and it must be very difficult to make a whole game almost by yourself. but this game is not what those who fell in love with the alpha were waiting for. All it needs is an exploration mode. where the world is random and the map is blacked out, and yes. no region lock. I hope this game is still being worked on and he hasn't given up on it, because it has mountains of potential. It's just not there yet unfortunately."
55451452,english,1,1128000,"For the longest time I have been searching for a casual game that I would be able to lean back and play with my friends. From Garry's Mod to Counter-strike, this game fills the void that no other game could. A lot of people are hating on the game because they've waited 6 years for it, and expected something totally different than what they wanted. They expected a masterpiece. Their masterpiece. This game won't fit everyone. It isn't easy. It takes time. People wanted this game to be so many things, and it wasn't what they expected because the game had changed from alpha to now. From a muddle mess to this amazing game. A game meant to bring people together, to fight challenging mobs, get loot, and explore the endless world. This game may not be what everyone wanted, but it is amazing nonetheless. All the people crying about it through their steam reviews are to idealistic to stray from what they WANTED the game to be. Cube World is not perfect, but it is a far cry from a bad game. If you give it time and effort, the game will reward you. Playing both solo and with friends, it isn't impossible. I love this game, and I think that if you are looking for a challenging, casual game to play by yourself or with friends, look no further. Go into this game with a clean mindset. It is a new game, it is not the alpha version from 6+ years ago."
90752168,english,0,1128000,The game is sadly unlike the alpha in pretty much every way. I hope we will get updates to fix this but for now I highly recommend modding the game to enhance the gameplay
55467589,english,1,1128000,"This game is amazing! Now take everything I say with a grain of salt saying as I never played the alpha because I couldn’t get it before it got taken down.  This game is great, but has its downsides. Pros: The game itself looks amazing The soundtrack is lovely The different classes and subclasses means everyone has something for them (for instance Scout and Beserker for me) The way enemies spawn seems better than what the alpha had (I believe the alpha was you spawned at 0 x 0 z and the further you went from 0, 0 the harder the enemies got, versus now regions have all different types of monsters just hanging about and different quests have different levels of monsters) And a whole lot more I could talk about  Cons:  The game has no tutorials, making learning what to do at the start a bit of a challenge if you didn’t play the alpha Items and armor are region locked (excluding artifacts and equipment+) which makes the game less “get good items and blitz the game” and more or less a restart every region.  The region system needs some improvement, the idea itself is good but the execution isn’t too hot, maybe if it were countries that took up the space of like 4 to 6 regions depending on how powerful the country is it would be better  Overall, I still enjoy the game, but there are definitely some things that could be improved, I feel confined to one region until I get good items in that region, but this game applies to a certain type of people and I don’t think it deserves the hate it’s getting, it’s not a bad game it could just use some improvement"
177696319,english,0,1128000,In the alpha it was better than now. the game now not the best with mods it will be playable but its not better than the alpha version. i hope there will be an update or a fix and it will the best again. i miss the alpha.
84324488,english,0,1128000,"The released version of the game is awful. I played the game back in 2013 before it was removed from Picroma's website and had high hopes for the full release. Wollay's bizarre strategy of removing the game from stores for almost a decade was a terrible one. He worked on the game sure, but with no player feedback. It's a game designed for him and him alone. The game is visually stunning that's for sure. That's about all it has going for it in it's current state.  The progression system is awful. Earning XP, leveling up, as well as the Skill Point system were all pruned from the game. The current progression system has you grinding gear like am ARPG, with the caviot of that gear being literally useless outside of the zone it is acquired in. I think this has an interesting Philosophy behind it, but when the game is focused around exploration and finding new zones, it feels terrible. You can spend a dozen hours grinding out the perfect set with just the stats you want, but if cross an invisible boundary you might as well have nothing equipped. This makes the game feel pointless. There is no point in killing ANYTHING in the open world. Enemies do not give XP, rarely ever drop items, and the items they do drop are low quality. So you spend most of the game just avoiding everything. The world feels hollow. The only way to get gear is by going to towns, talking to NPCs until they give you a map location to clear. The skill point system in the Alpha was atleast interesting as you could tailor your character towards a specific build, whereas in the full version of the game, the only improvements you can make to your character are how hard and fast you can auto attack.  Another thing of note is the difficulty of the game. There is no tutorial in game and very limited UI. The default UI has your only ability cooldown tucked into the bottom left corner of the screen, when your health, MP, and your focus are all going to be towards the center. You spawn in the wild right after making your character which is pretty flush and seamless, but if you're a new player, you'll quickly come to realize you don't know what to do. Again, this gives me the impression this is just Wollay's personal game that no one else is supposed to enjoy, let alone play. Any friend I've had try the game has quit within two hours of playing it due to the terrible new player experience. The enemy AI is terribly overpowered. Ranged and magic using enemies literally cannot miss so combat revolves around doing more damage to them before they kill you. The final nail in the coffin for me was the boomerang enemies. When they throw their boomerang, it has aggressive tracking and hardly ever misses, even with immunity frames while rolling. If and when it connects it doesn't return but instead glues onto your character doing constant damage for around 5 seconds. It only takes 2 boomerang throws to kill a newly created character. If your character is a boomerang user, it functions much differently to the point where you question if your boomerang is just cosmetic. Magic uses suffer a similar issue when they cast a tornado spell it moves along with the character they're targeting causing it to never miss, whereas when your character can cast tornado spells if you move your mouse even slightly the entire spell cancels. Somehow Wollay made the enemy AI worse to the point of being irredeemable.  It's really sad that the limited Alpha version of the game feels like it's had much more work and love put into it than the full release version with almost a decade to get the vision down. I hope Wollay reads some feedback for once and gets this game on track. It has a lot going for it. It's gorgeous and the core RPG concepts themselves have potential. It's like watching your crush get a train ran on her. Like why is she even at this party in the first place, she was such a good girl and could be with such a good guy but instead she's getting railed in exchange for xanax and alcohol."
166081782,english,0,1128000,Although I used mods to improve the experience it wasn't enough to save it. I highly recommend anyone to avoid touching this and go play Trove or Valoren instead.
121965642,english,1,1128000,"Ive always loved this game, Over the years i've showed people this game because its literal fun groups or even just to solo play and run wild. Mechanics from the early days i do miss but the game now is still very solid. I hope for the game to come back alive with more updates soon maybe even steam deck availability. Ive got plenty of new ideas for the game if youd be interested for updates Picroma. To anyone else reading ignore the bad reviews and give the game a try i promise its worth it."
114266002,english,0,1128000,The developer decided to put the game on steam and then never do anything with it. He took a bunch of peoples money and never updated the game. Dont buy it.
84122310,english,1,1128000,"The game is tolerable after you mod it. And even then it's a little questionable. Cute aesthetic.  I hope the mods fix the ridiculously HP'd enemies, terrible combat style, the weapon limitation per specialization, and the laser beam attacks that you can't dodge. An enemy shouldn't have 16k HP .____. Idk why that is a thing.   Mod's seem to region lock and help in enemy scaling but even then I seem to frequently get my shit rocked by a snail if i step two feet outside of the village.  The quests and aesthetic is great, I just wish it was more scaled/fair so that we aren't constantly dying."
176631585,english,1,1128000,"This game is a pretty decent game. The game definitely took a wrong turn whilst in development and it shouldve stayed more  closer to the alpha. The game is probably not worth 20 dollars but its still an extremely fun game if you have the dedication to play it. There are some huge flaws with the game that cause people to not buy it. 1. All players are on the same server with different regions and biomes, the problem with this is that players can spawn in a biome with insanely strong enemies and be very stuck. 2. All your equipment and gear downgrades to practically shit once you leave the region it was found in. 3. the leveling system is terrible consisting of collecting ""artifacts"" which barely increase any of your stats such as +3% climbing speed. Now for the upsides. 1. The graphics are amazing and the art and design is great. 2. the gear system i personally think is more improved than the alpha version as now its a star system instead of +1 2 3 etc. 3. Your given a wide verity of weapons to chose from 3 for each class each with its own attack speed, right click attack, and some of them you can dual wield. In short, Cube World steam version had almost achieved a perfect game but it strayed too far from the alpha, if you have a spare 20 dollars spare and looking for a grindy game, this is the game for you. (or if you want free just search up on google for alpha)"
175409709,english,0,1128000,"Really good concept but unfortunatly i cant recomend this as it is just a lvl 1 grinding simulator for every new area you go into. you dont ever feel like you get genuinly powerful and the few items that can scale across zones, + items, are random drops with no consistent way to get them ie. crafting questing etc. over all cool game idea but poorly executed and from reading some of the other reviews you may have seen that the prealpha was pretty fun and a good experience but this is just disapointing at the current state of it and im 90% sure they aren't updating it anymore, truely sad, not worth the $25 NZD."
178964740,english,1,1128000,"I played this game in the Alpha version a pretty long tome ago, so I have nostalgic memories of Cube World. I played it recently and bought the steam version and here's what I have to say about Cube World in general:  I truly believe this game likely would have been a titan in the ""block game"" category if the creator didn't take a hard left turn when updating it past alpha to put on steam. Alpha world generation is peak world generation, the game was simple and had an addictive gameplay loop. Improving skill trees, adding human companions, improving village generation (or making a quest based generation) could have been implemented to make the game perfect.  Cube World Steam Version changes the main gameplay loop entirely. crafting materials are rarer and loot drops are better, and there is no level restriction on equipment. The new gameplay loop is kill bosses, loot better gear, kill more bosses. The objective of Steam Version is to collect ""Artifacts"" around the biomes which give random improvements to abilities. Leaving a biome removes all the items collected and ""resets"" your character. This is a literal gameplay ""Loop."" Once you complete the first area, you have to do the exact same thing again from the bottom. Dying in steam version also sucks. Even with gear equal to the boss, you are still extremely likely to die if you don't cheese the boss. respawn areas are 1-3 entire minutes away from boss locations, so you are stuck holding W and maybe scrolling on your phone for 3 minutes just to die immediately and do it again. This is where I stopped playing Steam Version, fighting the highest level enemy with the highest level equipment and losing multiple times.   The alpha version is a craft/loot combination exploration game. You start out extremely weak, dying to every wild animal. Finding crafting materials and fighting the few enemies you can defeat lets you get better armor and use the very limited skill tree. Killing the bosses scattered around the map provides you with special crafting materials for weapons and a bunch of exp. As you level up, you can craft better gear and equip better gear. That is the gameplay loop of alpha Cube World. Craft and equip gear to kill difficult bosses, level up, craft more gear and fight more bosses. The distance between bosses in alpha is still obscene, but there are respawn points 15 seconds away from every boss, and the areas in between are filled out better with ore, crafting materials, and radiant bosses.  I really wish this game was moddable. Sadly, it seems that the developer made a lot of the code and programs very unfriendly to modders. The 4-5 mods for this game are not true scripted mods, but are instead mods that change 1 or 2 numbers of a variable.  Heres how I suggest enjoying cube world:  1. Buy the steam version and play it for a few hours. Don't hurt the developer because you don't like how they manage their game, they still deserve support for creating the game you are playing.   2. Look for the alpha version download online. Download that version and play it for a few hours as well. The game is very hard in the start because everything can kill you, so don't get discouraged right off the bat. There is little skill mechanics in the game, enemies auto lock attacks, have super far reach and attack faster than you can dodge. You are required to get better equipment to defeat enemies."
90147833,english,0,1128000,"Like many others, I played the alpha version and loved it. I achieved thousands of levels because of it and it stayed interesting  because of it's uniqueness of graphics and gameplay. I understand that the full release had to live up to the success of the Alpha but it tried too hard to be unique that it ultimately failed. The mechanic where different regions have a ""lock"" on your gear is, in my opinion, stupid. I can spend hours grinding for good gear in one area, but when I decide to explore this vast world some more, the game punishes you by locking your items. This game that promotes exploration with its vast, open world and many enemies also contradicts itself by essentially taking away all the gear you worked hard for at first. You can for sure fix these problems with mods, but players shouldn't have to fix a games problems themselves. I bought this game when it first came out on steam however so I didn't have much options when it came to mods. In short, buy the game if you don't care about downloading a few mods; normal vanilla gameplay doesn't do it for me though."
191523910,english,0,1128000,"Cube World had so much potential, especially after the promising alpha that got a lot of people excited. The voxel-based world, the exploration, and the RPG mechanics all seemed like they were building up to something great. But when the full release finally arrived, it just didn’t live up to expectations.  A lot of the mechanics that made the early version enjoyable were completely changed or removed, and the progression system felt more frustrating than rewarding. Instead of leveling up and growing stronger over time, everything resets whenever you enter a new region, making long-term character development feel pointless.  The world itself is still visually charming, and the movement and combat can be fun for a while, but the game lacks the depth needed to keep players invested. It’s a real shame because the foundation was there for something amazing. Instead, Cube World feels more like a hollow version of what could have been.  If you loved the alpha, you might find some enjoyment here, but be prepared for a very different experience. Otherwise, it’s hard to recommend, especially when so many other open-world RPGs do it better."

I was, of course, playing the alpha build of the game,. Hundreds of hours of gameplay and I was still finding tings completely new to me. I remember freaking out the first time I ever found a portal. I was mind blown. I was amazed. I had absolutely fallen for this game. It became a ritual of mine to search online forums and social media for any trace of the game, and its future updates.   This is one of my all time favorite games. But not like this. Not in this state. This ""completed"" Cube World is nothing at all like what I spent countless hours on. I do NOT recommend this version of Cube World. The only reason I purchased and kept the game was to try to pay Wollay back for the enjoyment I received from the alpha build. Seeing this game in the state it is now leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, and I will forever be heartbroken for what Wollay has done do his beaitufl creation.  All that being said, if anyone wants the alpha build of the game, I am more than willing to share with you on Google Drive. I would recommend Alpha 1000x before this full release. Since the game is ""completed"" now, and the alpha version is lost to time, the only way to receive it is to either pirate it or have it shared.

I would like to know from the dev if he really thought that region locking items would be a good move and everyone would like it. This game completely sucks at its current state, you don't even have a motivation to move to another region and explore the map. It's completely dumb the way items and equipment work now. I played the alpha version till lvl 365 and now I can't even play one hour straight without ragin the entire system. Just don't buy it.

89728595,english,0,1128000,"[For anyone who played Alpha/Beta]. Review given on 4-4-2021. In short: Do not recommend to buy this game BEFORE 2022 as some people claim the developer is still working on this game(If that even is true?).  My review: Remember the skill tree? GONE Remember the proper item crafting? GONE Remember the farming system where you had to find certain characters to get items? GONE  I [b]LOVED[/b] the Alpha and beta. If you see the game and are wishing to still try it out. Don't, its a different game now. Whats new: - No leveling/skill tree, just plain skill (exept for the first hour since EVERYTHING can kill you untill you find at minimum 1 legendary item) - Items are just farming a region. Take a biome of minecraft in mind and take that size, thats ur play size. If you get a FULL legendary set, it's [b]LITERALLY[/b] useless, since everything that is legendary in THAT specific region is BASIC in another region/biome. Once you find 1 or 2 legendary items, you can kill anything so it's creating boring fights. This means in EVERY biome, you must basically START OVER (Stats change the moment u enter the biome or go back). This is basically a run, farm and then do it over again, there is NO progress to be done if you are finished with farming items.   As much as i wanted to feel the nostalgia and was thinking: ""It can't be THAT bad, it's probably still a fun game"". Believe the other people.

The region locking mechanic and the slow start (hour or two of just running around, hoping you can find a piece of equipment that allows you to actually do something), make the game excruciatingly boring. Then, after you swap regions, you have to do it all again. It's tedious, boring, and insanely grindy. Not to mention, the long term rewards you get are useless, since the stuff it goes towards gets taken away from you each region anyways.

I tried so damn hard to make something positive out of this game for 24 hours of gameplay here, and i bet my left buttcheek 100+ on the alpha, and failed.   Cube world, created by a German company Picroma, was a spin-off to Minecraft back in 2011-2012 when cube games where the stuff, and open world random-gen sandboxes thrived both singleplayer-wise and multiplayer-wise.  After about 2 months of sales of the alpha on Picroma's website, the site has been overloaded by a supposed DDoS attack on the store, making the game unpurchasable and traumatising one of the developers to hide for 6 years with only two windows on the outside world: Their Twitter accounts.  For six years, every month or so, Wolay or Pixxie were to drop in a sneak peek of what is to come to the game, the Harps, new enemies, new dungeons or quest systems, many things! How hyped we have been since we got each piece of the puzzle!  Wollay and Pixxie pretty much has created a cult out of the fanbase, waiting for their messiah to give them a lesson in their religion. And as every cult, not every one was satisfied with a prayer or a teaching... we had extremists.  People literally have sent the guy hate mails, threats, hate comments, sadly not every fan was over 15 at the time... Me neither lol, But i'd never send something  like that to a talented guy.  Critique sent to Wollay did not have much response, but was enough to create an unofficial discord, were people rallied to help the guy out and send him some more deserved motivation by sending a smiley or some stuff...   off to the game now:  Six years since then has passed, and I ahve been greeted by a GIGANTIC steam advert that CUBEWORLD is COMING OUT. THIS SEPTEMBER. OH. MY. GOD.  2012 kiddo has been revived in my soul, and went to an override.  Cubeworld on an updated version of the engine, with new stuff, new adventures... MUSIC (ThANK GOD! This game was a mute back then!) and an ability to play with friends via steam!  Then you input your hard-earned (or hard saved) bucks on the title, you downlaod it... (200MB! HAH) And run it! You are greeted by a blue fog of war, the classic in that universe, the engine after 6 years still can't comprehend rendering....  Okay, not bad! you are in the game, made yourself the water mage (Like the ol'school days) Aaaand you get greeted by the unknown.  Mechanics have changed.  -there is no skills anymore, everything is unlocked since the beginning. -money is different, each enemy drops a coin or two, no matter what tier. -there is no XP anymore, just the wierd artifacts with permanent movement buffs (which are utterly useless, I don't want +1% swim speed) villages feel uglier than before, instead of nice, pastel coloured cities we have villages now, soviet-russia grade.   and here goes the fun part...  *cricket noises*  Oh yeah. THERE AINT ANY!  You don't really progress your character, except the artifact unlocks, which are hidden inside a top-tier dungeon in every region.  Oh. Yeah. Remeber that sword you have dropped on the way? or the boat you havefound after 20 minutes of walking and 30 minutes of respawning back in the latest respawn point?   ITS GONE AFTER YOU CROSS THE BORDER OF THE REGION!  Yep. Tools disappear, you in two oceans regions? Nuh uh, magic border-patrol locks your boat back in the region it came from!  TL;DR: game has lost it's golden nuggets, and decided to paint droplets of crap with a golden spraypaint. And Wollay?  He's out. And as much as I am sad,  I hope he won't come back to CubeWorld. Not even with an update.  You broke too much my man."
79175447,english,1,1128000,"Its a fun game but its a joke compared to the Alpha version of this game. If the developers didn't touch the game and just released it when it was in Alpha it would've been 100x better. Unfortunately they changed a lot of stuff that made the game worse. The game is still fun just seriously downgraded. Its a shame that its in this state, I really hope that the devs bring back the old version of the game and use that instead of this version.  You should buy this game if you're either bored or if its on sale.  Here's some Alpha gameplay.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QNU2REynjA&ab_channel=Haxzer  Here's a review for the game that shows what specifically happened to it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAm3sFRqJLI&ab_channel=ProbablyJacob"
92080681,english,1,1128000,"TLDR: Don't play if you're a beta user - it's not going to fill the gap in your heart. If you have no prior experience with Cube World, give it a shot.  Okay, so first of all something needs to be clarified. Most of the negative reviews are from people who played the game back in the early alpha/beta stages and miss the mechanics designed back then.   The game is fairly good, my wife and I had a great time playing it together, albeit somewhat simpler in its current form than those complaining desire. I would encourage you to come to it with an open mind, and remember that it is only for $20.   Pros: -The game feels great to explore in, similar to minecraft. The world is breathtakingly beautiful even though it's simple voxels.  -The pets are cute and finding them and giving them the right food feels great.  -Enemies are challenging in each section until you get decent gear, and you have to re-gear in each zone. (This becomes monotonous after more than 2 zones.) -Co-op. -Certain quests feel rewarding (such as saving a village which is petrified.)  Cons: -Re-gearing in new zones can be frustrating. -20 hours or less, even with the massive world. -Most quests begin to feel like repeats, and lack decent rewards. -Entering a new area forces you to find new lassos/gliders/flutes etc. Losing these items reminds you how crucial they are and can be irritating.  There are four classes, each with their own weapons/style. I recommend water mage for newbies - healing is very helpful early on. (You change your subclass in a village.)   It's certainly not a bad game, especially for the price."
187755467,english,0,1128000,"Played the og. Was waiting for YEARS for it to release. Finally did, and Woolay abandoned it.  Gameplay loop is crap. You farm and farm and farm for gear, go to a new area and suddenly your gear is utterly useless.  It's cute, and I was really hoping for the game to actually be fully fleshed out, have constant updates etc etc but no. Woolay has gone dark since the release. So many other solo indie devs that communicate with their fans and add updates. Shame Woolay isn't one of them."
67456249,english,0,1128000,No support from sole dev.  He really messed up a fun game and then disappeared.  Seems like a quick money grab.  Dont buy unless he comes back and fixes it.
190410025,english,0,1128000,"Such a disappointment. I still think about this game, and even consider going back sometimes, and I’m always immediately reminded why I never should. A absolutely atrocious progression system completely ruins the experience of this game. Everything you do feels pointless because once you leave your current zone, all of your progress is completely wiped away. I hope one day the developer comes back and tries something new with this, because there is so much lost potential here."
92385282,english,0,1128000,"EDIT: Wollay is now working on a new update called Cube World Omega. The new additions and returning Alpha elements sound very promising. I'm looking forward to seeing what he has in store for us. Despite my harsh criticism I do enjoy Cube World and want both it and Wollay to succeed. I will post a new review once this next major update is out. Fingers crossed and good luck Wollay.  Even with a copious amount of mods to fix some of the biggest issues, this is one of the biggest disappointments I have ever purchased and experienced. Wollay dropped the ball hard and the only person he can blame is himself. Turning his back on the community doomed this game. Several straight up boneheaded decisions like region locking items and horrible excuses for progression sucked all the fun out of this simple but charming game. If you are at all interested in this game, go play the alpha from 2013. It is much more fun and rewarding than this boring and frustrating experience. Hopefully Wollay will eventually fix and atone for his mistake and take responsibility. He needs to take the feedback and feelings of the community seriously instead of running away with his tail between his legs again."

I started playing for a bit but it felt different. So, I searched online what happened... All I'm going to say if you're reading this. There is still hope out there for you and this project.

If you really want this game go for it, but don't buy it at normal price ( since its clearly overpriced) and 1st check when the last update was made, if it hasn't been touched  since released chances are it wont be touched for another 6 years ( time is heavily dependent on how long the money he made lasts)."
144198815,english,0,1128000,"Before this game came to Steam, and before the major update that took the developers 20 years to release, this game was worth every penny. Sure, it had it glitches and bugs, but it was a game in-development. Now, I believe that saying this game is still under development is a tragic understatement. Before the update, you didn't have to worry about your weapons and armor no longer being effective because you went to a new area on the map. While fighting was challenging, it was not impossible, and you could actually kill stuff. Remember when you would kill something and get experience for it? For some reason, that was taken out, eliminating one of the biggest ways to level up. Now, the only way you can level up is accepting quests that will take you to incredibly difficult dungeons that are so far up the leveling scale, you'd have to be hopelessly addicted to this game just to attempt to be high enough level to take those dungeons on. The mages are still OP as hell, you can no longer buy the gliders and boats from the shops, you now have to go and FIND them. Characters you create are now tied to their own worlds, so you can no longer create your own worlds. Finding gear for your character's class is hopelessly rare, whereas before the update you could just find a landmark, drop the gear you couldn't use, hop onto another character that could use that gear, go to that landmark, and give that character that gear. Not anymore. There isn't even a mailing system where you could send stuff to another character of yours.  Don't waste your money on a game that only got worse after a major update the devs spent too long to release. This game was amazing once, now it's just a hopeless grind with OP enemies, and crappy leveling. How I wish there was a pre-update version of this game. But, just like with everything else we were hoping to see in the new update: it'll never happen."
55469836,english,0,1128000,"If you're thinking of buying this because of seeing videos of Alpha gameplay, don't, it's entirely different and almost nothing like the Alpha. It's essentially just running around trying to figure out what to do for 2 hours, before finally realizing you need to do quests to do anything at all, realizing you need to cheese every boss or have extremely over the top gear from cheesing a high level enemy, and then losing everything you've gained the moment you travel too far. Just save your money until it's fixed, which it most likely wont be."
55417625,english,0,1128000,"man i want to like this game so bad.... after finishing the first zone, I was having a blast. Then I left that zone. Everything gone except for a useless ""artifact"" that only made my lamp shine a little brighter.  I'm sorry but the alpha had more content then the game does right now. Before there was much more to do with an exp system (not to mention the oceans are literally EMPTY husks. Before there were fish, now there's seemingly NOTHING in there)  Its depressing what happened to this game. I honestly hope it's an experimental release or something along those lines. All those years just to have my expectations(which honestly if he just added some needed changes to the old game, I would have been fine with) completely shattered. I know this sounds like a self centered review but this is just how I feel about it. It's not what I played a couple years ago. :/  Not to mention, every zone your practically doing the same thing over and over, just with a different name and zone look. No variety."
55407632,english,0,1128000,"The alpha is an absolutely lovely charming skill based exploration game that I sunk countless hours into.  The release is not.   Skill trees, abilities and the sense of progression have been removed. The game to me is unplayable and joyless.  I am very tempted to refund the game but I am hoping that Wolfram can come back from the ether he has disappeared into, show some signs of life, speak up and see the criticisms.  Please fix this burning pile of a game."
109349492,english,1,1128000,"On It's own the game is a shadow of it's former alpha. But with mods slightly tweaking the games core, it can turn into an adventure that no other game can give you. There's plenty of open world space, fun fights, awesome loot. Overall a very good experience."
118979516,english,1,1128000,"I will recommend with one large asterisk: play with mods. I did try it without mods first and knew beforehand what I was getting into because I did some research on the game. I never played the alpha but it seems most preferred the game in that state. Without mods there is no leveling and you are more or less restricted to a zone because of the way gear works. Yes, you can explore to your heart's content, however it is nearly fruitless because you can explore and get your gear worked up pretty nicely in zone X only for it to become useless in any other one.  The mods I have used (I found them posted in the discuss section) reintroduced leveling and a host of other things that were apparently supposed to be in the finished game. Gear is still lightly tied to zones and will suffer a downgrade when entering a new area but it doesn't become completely useless.  It is a fun game but I suspect if you aren't very interested in modding your games you will likely become bored because of stark limitations of gameplay. It is also pretty tough and you will probably have to grind out very weak mobs to get at least a couple levels before being able to do much like craft some armor and a better weapon. I haven't been using guides or anything but as a mage I found I can cheese quite a bit by staying on tree tops and using magic. Doesn't work 100% of the time as some enemy projectiles (and your own magic) can break foliage and leave you tumbling to the ground if you aren't careful. You can almost fly (better than using a Hang Glider you find) by using your float ability: jump, hit float, then rapidly tap it as you sail in a direction you want. It keeps you fairly horizontal in the direction you wish to go.  Been having some fun with it even though it really does require some mods to get longevity out of it."
191086850,english,1,1128000,"Cube World is a decent game in its current state, but man it could have been so much more. I remember playing the alpha years ago and being super hyped for a full release. The current state of the game with its zone locking shenanigans makes it fun for the first handful of hours, but when you begin going to new zones and have your good gear suddenly become worthless it kinda loses steam. I really wish Wollay stuck around through all the backlash and really polished this game up to perfection À la No Man's Sky. The only other game that comes close to Cube World's style is Trove, but Trove is an MMO and doesn't really play the same. I wish steam had a option for leaving a mixed review for games like this."
150385841,english,0,1128000,"I loved the progression in one area, slowly getting stronger, but going to a new area and being instantly back to 0? It made it feel like i wasted my time."
121553204,english,0,1128000,"Abandoned Game. A shame really.  Dev took the money and ran, which is really sad since this clearly had potential. Its not like its a bad game, but people waited 6 Years for this after the Alpha released 2013, only to get a game that is arguably less finished than before somehow.   They completely scrapped the well liked Progression System from the Alpha of the Game. Instead we now have essentially region locked gear and levels. When you leave the Area you got your gear from, it downgrades it to abyssmal stats, making it unusable. As you can guess, this is a very... questionable feature in a Game with infinite world generation.   A lot of the stuff the Dev of this game promised and teased is simply not in the game.  Im talking big cities, certain kinds of dungeons, skilltrees etc.  You know, the good stuff people actually wanted.  Furthermore, you`ll need a playlist. Since the music in this game, while not sounding bad at first, starts giving you a headache after around ~30mins. Every song sounds the same with slight changes or one different instument. It just gets on your nerves after a while.  If you plan on playing this in Multiplayer, i have bad news for you.  It simply doesnt work. Desyncs, random disconnects, people not showing up despite being online, friends not being able to join for no reason etc.  Big servers with 100+ people like back in the Alpha are not a thing anymore. Gone are the days of 30 People teaming up to kill a +4 Legendary monster.   As you can guess from this review, i am really dissapointed.  Especially since this could have been amazing if the Dev just expanded on the already successfull Alpha.   This is a perfect example of: ""If it aint broke, dont fix it."" Overall: 2/10  Rather play the unfinished Alpha."
64326307,english,0,1128000,"I enjoy my time playing Cube World. I think for the first couple hours you have a character and you are learning, or relearning the game, is a real treat, but after you've done your first region it just goes downhill from there. I feel like I'm speed-running the next couple regions. I ask myself ""why am I subjecting myself to this boredom and displeasure?"" so I stop playing. But somehow it seems the I'm always drawn back. I think if you were there for the hype of the game; you should buy it just to see what it really is lie for yourself, but if you are totally new to the game; don't buy it. It will only cause you to be frustrated and hate the game."

88814778,english,0,1128000,"This game had potential, but the developer is a complete diva who throws online tantrums. This game suffered at his hands the way minecraft did with Notch; an overly controlling entrepreneur who wants to produce THEIR vision. There are new systems that drain the fun from the game. The cool generated castles and dungeons are gone. NPC's spout one of half a dozen madlib phrases. ""I'm going to be the greatest <class> in the land!"" Good for you, you wafer thin attempt at content!  Lets talk about the elephant in the room: per-land gear. This has to be one of the least well thought out ways to artificially stretch the content out. Gear crafting allows you to add a voxel to your weapon, but the crafting has all the depth of a teaspoon.  This should be my favorite game ever. As a minecraft, zelda and d&d player this is like the venn diagram intersection! The formula is gold, as proven by the alpha! But the poor choices in the games design are astoundingly dumb, and turn this into a waste of money. I really hope this gets sold to a professional developer, or is saved by mods, but I'm not holding my breath."
114816851,english,1,1128000,"I'm not gonna say that this game is the greatest game of all time, far from it. but for only like two developers, this is pretty good. Alpha was probably a few steps in the right direction farther then this, but this isn't bad if you remove the region locking problem (can be fixed with mods). Its worth a good 10-15 hours of fun playtime (would be much longer without region locking), and I think at a discount this game is worth buying. Also contrary to popular belief, I think the dev is still working on the game."

55402227,english,1,1128000,"Hey, after 6 years of silent, we actually get to play Cube World. And I'll be honest. I enjoyed it. Even though I recommended Cube World, I'm not saying this game didn't have a flaw, it's a big one as well. But let go over the good thing I found first. + The environment is great. Everything look very lively and colorful, making exploring alone fun and enjoyable. + The game greatly present exploring. The more you explore the stronger you become, but that doesn't mean you would become overpower, as you explore more zone, the more adaptive the game become. As you can't use the same gear in another zone (Not including Plus Gear of course) you need to explore more if you want to get stronger, which allow you to explore even more terrain. + The artifact is very interesting, to actually level up, you need to explore. Gathering as much information as possible to locate the artifact. The artifact as a concept act more like a treasure hunt rather than a progression.  Now that we're done with the pros, now for the flaws. - The game is very unbalance. When you start the game, you will die a lot, as most monster actually one shot you if you get too close, and fighting against range enemy at first feel like hell, especially mages as their move are strong as hell. If you challenge a strong enemy at first. You do not stand a chance. But once you get rarer gear, it only get much more powerful the more you go. Even you yourself is unbalance, some skills is actually hella broken. The example of this is Ranger Scout Subclass Ultimate. The quicksands is so strong as the move slow the enemy, let them take more damage, and have hilariously low cooldown of 40 seconds, and the cooldown actually start when you activate the ability, not when it disappear. You can actually beat a level 5 melee boss with the starter gear by abusing this skill. And that just cheating. - The game is lacking motivation, once you get stronger gear, you become too powerful in that zone, but once you change area, your gear immediately become useless, being weaker than a level 1 gear in that zone. Seeing this, most people get discourage about exploring, and just play in that area until they're bored and stop playing. The artifact, even if it fun to find it, still doesn't have enough impact to make people think exploring is important. - This is the biggest flaws of the game, it's very repetitive. There are difference between repetitive and replayable, and Cube World lean into repetitive rather than replayable. Each time you explore into different area, you are having a different experience, but it's the same, you make a gear, fight something until you get better gear, get the best gear, beat all the dungeons and quest in that area, get information for artifact, then change area. And you do that everytime, and yes, there is something different each time, but the main thing is always the same.  Looking at my review, you may think the game isn't fun. But you need to try it. The game may miss progression and motivation, but the game is enjoyable, everything pros blend in together perfectly and with a little more love and care, this game can clearly be a masterpiece. And hey, maybe this will be another no man sky fiasco, who know?  In Conclusion, This game may not be the best. But you cannot find any experience like it anymore. You may enjoy it or not, but that doesn't stop this game from being fun. I encourage everyone to pick up the game and try it for themselves. If you enjoy it, great! If not, well, leave a review!"

55516502,english,0,1128000,"Basically everything it was good for was removed, and most of the stuff shown during development - not added. This game is a good example of what happens when you don't communicate with the people who follow the development as much, basically making the game alone and not even testing it.

55452432,english,1,1128000,"If you have never played a previous version of Cube World before, please read this review:  The reason the reviews are mixed as of now is because a lot of players who played Cube World in the alpha version are unhappy at the state of the game at release. This is because the level progression system changed since alpha, as well as other game-changing factors. Ultimately, their expectations were high then suddenly dropped.  Now let me review this game as somebody who has never played Cube World prior to my purchase 3 days ago:  This game does have an interesting leveling system - yes. Each region contains at least one artifact that you get through exploring the region, talking to people and obtaining better gear. This artifact gives you a slight upgrade to something. This is your level progression. Most gear doesnt transfer  over to other regions meaning you have to start the grind all over again. To me, this is a lot of fun. I enjoy the unique system this game follows. This system definitely is not for everyone though.   Another aspect of the game I enjoy is the exploration. Exploration is forced, but thats what you would expect from an open world, adventure game. The exploration in this game in my opinion is done so well that I never get bored wandering around. I could do so for hours. The adventure and scenery in this game gives it a truly magical appeal that puts me in a positive mood. Not to mention this game has the best map function I have ever witnessed in a game.   To conclude, this game is a magical experience full of superlative adventure and hours of content. The level system is different, but not difficult to get used to. As off-putting as most reviews for this game are, try not to let that change your viewpoint on the game, since a lot are biased towards a previous version. As somebody playing this game for the first time, I absolutely recommend this game if you are looking for an exciting adventure."

190398560,english,0,1128000,"Game was completely reworked from the previous version disregarding everything it had and left to rot once again, the developer doesn't seem to care much about consumer opinion, disregard this game and go back to the alpha version."

61774691,english,1,1128000,"I need to preface this with the following; unmodded, Cube World is awful. But installing the mods required to fix the progression system is incredibly easy, which results in an infinitely superior experience.  The lack of a proper XP system was a bit of a let down at first, but having experienced the progression at its best, I can safely say I'm fine with it. Early game is hell but once you start accumulating power, shit hits the fan fast. Exploration is entertaining and satisfying, though the whole map being revealed from the start is a puzzling decision. The relic system is cool as well and combos effectively with the various stats your gear can grant, and the payoff for the lore is entertaining. Without region lock and with proper progression scaling as you move further away from where you started, Cube World is everything I'd hoped it would be. These two small changes fix the game in so many ways and the resulting experience is, IMO, a ton of fun.  Now for stuff that applies to the base game. Dungeons are fun to explore, enemy variety is extremely good and solid, and the landscapes are absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. My only complaints is, again, the whole map being revealed; it should reveal itself as you explore more segments of the world.  Make no mistake, the developer goofed hard, but the effort of the community to make it better makes it worth a buy in my honest opinion."
165255405,english,0,1128000,"I've wanted to enjoy this so bad since it launched on steam but it's just so annoyingly bad.  For starters, there is no clear cut leveling system. All of your stats are tied to your gear that you find/craft. There's no experience points and no abilities or talents to work towards unlocking. The latter isn't necessarily bad, but having access to all your class abilities from the start is slightly boring. It's an RPG with no skills to unlock. it feels weird.  The enemy scaling is terrible. You could start a new character, see some bugs in the distance you think you can take on and then be dead 10 seconds after attacking them.   Your gear is region locked. If you enter a new zone you have to re-obtain special equipment (boat, glider, etc.) for that zone and all of your gear gets downgraded. Did you spend a long time obtaining/crafting the best gear you could? Better get ready to do it all over again cause it will be useless if you enter a new region! And because your stats are tied to your gear (since there's no exp based leveling system) you're basically level 1 when you enter a new region!  Traveling becomes kind of annoying after a while. You will either need to find and tame a ride-able pet to speed you up or spend gold on flight paths.  Good luck trying to progress if its night time in game. This game is so unreasonably dark you cannot see anything. Your lantern does not provide enough light. Oh, and there is no brightness setting to crank up to get around this issue. So there's that.  Word gen customization. In the Alpha version of the game you could enter custom seeds for your world generation which was neat. That feature is gone now in this version. There aren't even world slots for you to use. It just assigns a world to your character and that's that.  This game had such potential to be amazing. A lot of people loved the alpha release, but the developer took so many steps in the wrong direction with this.  Don't buy the game. Not worth it unless the dev comes back from the dead to finish it. If you really want to play it though, make sure you mod it. I recommend trying CubeMegaMod. It's one of the few mods that are still compatible with the game."
55434178,english,0,1128000,"[h1] I really tried Wollay.....[/h1]  I loved cube world. Day one I was behind it. I even re-purchased it JUST TO SUPPORT THE CREATION.  However I must say I just cannot play it in its current state.  In the 27 minutes I played, my character was chased by red blobs that shot water, a Skull Bull, three giants and a golem. I fought everything I could but just died each time. The game also just....feels no different than the alpha. Hell, the alpha was better and more polished than this is to me. The game feels like you're supposed to fail. The first thing to get; the Glider, was in the middle of a volcano and no matter what I tried I just KEPT dying. Nothing stopped it. I could never get out to it. The animations are unchanged even though there are claims they are polished, and it just feels like a messy game release. We know you needed money back on this investment you made Wollay, but this feels lazy.....  Can I pet dogs? yes. Horses? Yeah. Pigs? Sheep? Cows? YES But can I enjoy myself with any other part of this game at this point? No.  All in all, just wait till it gets updates and patches. Its current state should be listed as a WIP or alpha. Early Access. Anything other than listed as a FINISHED game. Cause its not."
134838204,english,0,1128000,"If you really wanna play this go find the original alpha version online and download it for free. A lot of the best mechanics from the original game were left in the past and the TWO people that develop this game have, as far as we can tell over the years pretty much abandoned it. So much promise for nothing in the end"
55856264,english,1,1128000,"Deary me. Here goes. When this game was first released in 2013, together with an unbelievable amount of other blocky voxel games that have been indubitably inspired by the success of Minecraft, I was in my teens. Not having had any means of online payment, I didn't purchase it back then, though I was still moderately hyped from watching some YouTube creators playing it with their mates.   Due to this, I haven't had much in the way of expectations. I didn't know what I was getting, I didn't remember how good it has been. When it was announced that, after six years of development hell, it will be released, I was hyped which is why I got it on Day 1.   First impression... Well, you're not being told anything at all about the mechanics. A player needs to find out everything by themselves, trial and error, due to the lack of a tutorial. Would have been nice to include one.  After having found out about the basics of the game, I encountered the first feature which I immediately disliked. The vast majority of the obtainable items are locked to the region you picked them up in. It would appear that this is a product of the missing progression system. Progression is gathering all items, finishing all mission, completing every dungeon in one region, and start over in the next one. Probably not the best approach. Mages. F*ck mages. They are terribly overpowered. They hard-lock onto your sorry rear and frag you.   After doing some research, I of course found out that there are quite a few features missing from the original, making people rather unhappy, which is understandable. The ""low"" quality of the game is surely a by-product of Wollay's isolation during those six years. The community couldn't give any advice, recommendations, feature requests, etc., of course it isn't exactly what everybody wanted. Those issues can only be sorted out now. We also won't get any updates in the near future, since Wollay has gone MIA, probably dealing with PTSD. I'm certainly worried about him. All the best to Wollay. Concerning the accusations that ""Hur dur dur Wollay has scammed us!""... Are you serious?!?!?! I refuse to believe that this is the sole purpose of this game.  The game needs a few fixes and changes here and there. Some members of the community have made that quite clear, some have been quite toxic while doing that. Not really the best behaviour.  At any rate... I still like this game! It's fun, even if some others have been spoilt by and arguably better version and hence had higher expectations.  [Edit 31-10-19: Minor wording adjustments]"
96321733,english,0,1128000,The person just stopped making it after everyone hated the new version. Pulled something worse than EA games
85847129,english,1,1128000,this game is good if you use mod fixes. the mod makes it super fun all though we shouldnt have had to mod it ourselves.
68029646,english,1,1128000,"I expected to be able to sink as many hours into the game as I did in the Alpha version - unfortunately the region locking has led to my disillusionment with the game and to my choosing to uninstall it after 36 hours.  Simply put, the first two or three regions are fine, fun, fantastic - the discovery elements are great, the combat is solid as the Alpha was, and the pets meant I never felt completely alone despite playing exclusively in singleplayer.  Having gotten ""+ items"" early on, I had no issue with the regions surrounding my initial one, rapidly acquiring the gimmicks that locked content in these new regions (whistle, flute, bell, etc.). However, my enjoyment peaked there due to my losing all progress in the next region, which greatly disheartened me.  I believe there's a mod floating around somewhere (Reddit iirc) that disables the region-lock for reins, gliders, and boats, so I could probably get a bunch more enjoyment out of this game - but I'm in no hurry and I expect I'll revisit it at some point in the future.  With all this said, the base game is still incredibly fun and entertaining - one need only watch some gameplay on YouTube to see how fluid the game is, and in-person one can easily experience all the game has to offer in 2 hours. The main glaring issue remains the region-locking which broke my immersion and ended up making me shun the game, but perhaps others might not be as put off by this as me."
55545463,english,1,1128000,"Wall of text warning, this is getting long!  Honestly, I am having a lot of fun with this game! There is a lot more to it than many would have you believe. And, since I know this is going to be the first question a bunch of you ask, I did play Alpha. And, I like this better.   This is a game that has been designed with two goals in mind, endless adventure and seamless multiplayer, and the systems reflect that. It also seems to reward those who are not in a hurry and spend time gathering crafting ingredients, hunting non-boss mobs, and just generally enjoying the ride. It's not about the destination, if you play it with that mindset you will be very disappointed.  It's a lot of fun to just chill, relax, and adventure, however.  The gear is region-locked, meaning that when you enter a new ""region"" your gear becomes white (drop down to the first tier of gear), and you must find travel gear (boats, hang-gliders, and the like) again. You don't actually lose the old ones, they just don't work for the new region. Your gear also retains it's old properties if you ever want to return to where it's valid again (there is actually a good reason to do this). It even has it's own pages, navigable at the bottom of the inventory screen, to keep it separated from your current region. You may not want to sell your old region gear just yet.  Really, this is not that big a deal to me, and necessary to keep the game from becoming stale. You don't actually completely start over ""at square one"" when the gear resets, you still have all your potions and crafting ingredients, money, pets, and potentially + gear (gear that retains it's bonuses in larger multi-region areas so that it's useful longer). You have more than enough to really make a good start in the new region, and I don't personally find it feels like a whole new character.  Also, NPCs in the new regions still really like my old boots.  What this does do, however, is makes the content in this new region valid. There was this problem that I, and others, found in the Cube World Alpha progression system (similar issues happen in most progression systems if you try to extend them very far), and that was eventually (I found it didn't take all that long) your gear and levels made the game ridiculously easy, and most people just flew around on their hang-gliders looking for dungeons. There were only two main valid locations at that point. Dungeons and towns. This system is in response to issues like that, and has actually been pretty well thought out.  It does feel like a little bit of a let-down when my gear turns white and I am back to killing yard-trash for a while. It would be like this in many other ""normal"" progression systems, too, if you consider that you are now level 15 in a 15-25 region. This is perhaps harder to bear as you have a visible representation in gear color that does feel like you lost something. Still, I know to expect that, and I get the reason.  As mentioned before, + gear exists. This is gear that retains it's qualities in a larger multi-region area (I have seen the dev refer to them as ""Kingdoms"" once, but really don't know much more about them, or how they are defined, it's not obvious in-game). + gear is fairly rare, but after you have completed a region (found all the artifacts) it becomes more common. This is why I say it's a good idea to potentially return to regions you have already completed.  The world is huge. If I understand it right, it is essentially procedurally generated, but we all have the same seed to keep it multiplayer friendly. You start ""somewhere"" in this world and set out from there. It's not, however, like an MMO where you see others and their actions effect your own world. Multiplayer works through the Steam friend system, and you can join your friends in distant regions with free rides from the flight masters.  It is important to understand the difficulty system, and that it matters. There are several colored tiers of gear: white, green, blue, purple, gold. This is probably pretty familiar to many folks from other games. When starting out don't try to take down colored mobs. The quests also are (mostly) colored accordingly (the dungeons seem to register as white, but are not). Your character's current gear is rated similarly, with separate Armor and Weapon ratings. These seem to be pretty accurate indicators of what you can expect to handle, though be mindful of boss mobs. Boss mobs can be scary.  Pay attention to your surroundings. Stronger mobs can be found near weaker ones, but you can usually see them before you wander into them if you are mindful. I was already several hours in before I was killed by something powerful that caught me off-guard, and it seldom happens still.  I find the world is actually much more full than Alpha, though I am sure many would disagree with me. There are many little adventure sites in the wild, ones with mini-bosses and interesting challenges. One theme that seems pretty common is freeing merchant gnomes from things like undead, witches, and necromancers. I may have lucked out in my first region because I have a pile of stuff there, including a couple of Steel Empire airship invasions, and have seen other regions that don't seem nearly that full. Perhaps this is where some of the complaints come from.  Again, if you are the kind of player who likes to crash through content, you probably will want to pass this one by. The quests and challenges can require a bit of footwork to find, talking to villagers, completing other things first, things like that. But, if you are like me, and really like to just get immersed in the world it can be pretty fun. Personally I don't like having everything handed to me on a silver-platter in a nice clean quest-hub or breadcrumb trail. But, I also played EverQuest when it was new and really enjoyed that, as well. I find this easier.  There is no skill tree anymore, and while I don't actually like this, I do understand why the dev would have wanted to remove it. The idea is, I think, that any player can hang with any other player in any region, and this facilitates that goal. It still would have been nice to have potentially a horizontal skill tree, meaning you have access to new abilities, though new abilities that are reasonably balanced with the rest.  This is not to say all mages play the same, or anything like. Each class has a couple of specializations that offer different sets of abilities, and each weapon-type adds more variance to that. Off the top of my head I would say there are 6 ways to play that mage.  The game begins with the whole map revealed, though no details such as town names or quest area names filled in, these you can learn from NPCs or by going there yourself. There are mixed opinions on this since you can spend time inspecting the map to try locate towns and things. I don't mind it, and understand that it is facilitating the multiplayer aspect, as well as the fact you can just say ""I want to go explore a savannah today, let me check my map and catch a flight there.""  Is it a perfect game? No. Is it for everyone? No.  However, if the gameplay I described sounds appealing, and the region locking does not sound like such a harsh thing, it might well be worth trying out. I, and many others, actually like it quite a bit. The reviews on here are a bit skewed as most folks who do like it are scared to review due to the way certain elements in the community react to anything that does not agree with their opinions.  Not saying all the negative opinions are wrong, there are valid arguments, especially giving differing preferred playstyles, and I do agree with some of the criticisms out there. But, there are also people throwing out things like ""It's a scam"", ""The dev is (inset all sorts of nasty things)"", or various other toxic comments. I have also seen several reviews from people that, in my opinion, have not put enough time in to really have a firm grasp of what actually is here."
116164912,english,1,1128000,"Even if some features from the alpha never made it into the release, i still greatly enjoy cube world for what it is, without comparing it to the alpha. I am in favour of the region locking as i'm sure if you kept the best stuff you would just blow through regions with the only challenge coming from the first one. And with the key items, depending on the order you got them you have to traverse the land differently which always keeps things from being the same. Along with the different biomes, structures and dungeons my expectations are always exceeded by some places having completely different designs, especially with the underground places. However, this does not mean i didn't come across a few.. odd things. Graveyard houses with vault doors that require a harp to open only for them to have nothing inside, pillars being in odd places, and many npcs spinning around and on top of cauldrons with gnomes in them, and a few other small things like that. But i think there are so many other great parts of the game that greatly outweigh the bad. so yes i would recommend this game to people, but i would inform them on how it functions to see if the game is really for them. So please, keep on trying, i would love to see some of the things shown like cities and all sorts, if there is ANY hope whatsoever i would love to see this come back better than ever."

The reason I'm writing a positive and recommending you this game in the future is the modders. The modders of Cube World are hopefully going to fix Wollay's disaster making the game like it was in alpha and hopefully add new mechanics themselves. I'd wait about 2-3 more weeks. Either he comes out of hiding or the modders are just gonna fix the game themselves. The game has potential, it's not a bad game. There's many features that need rework and more content added. I will keep my faith more on the modders to make Cube World great again."

55353405,english,0,1128000,"Used to play the Alpha 6 years ago - I loved it. And before I get hate for disliking the new version: please hear me out. I honestly tried to love this game. Only played the new release myself for about half an hour atm, however I have seen countless of gameplay from the Beta. I conclude that in its current state, Cube World is sadly not worth playing.  The difficulty spike in the beginning, which basically forces you to avoid any combat, is not rewarding at all. Additionally, fighting isn't even encouraged as you don't earn XP from it (???). My main concern however is, that in an RPG which heavily focuses on EXPLORATION, you basically lose all your gear upon entering a new zone.  I can partially see what Wollay was trying to achieve with the gameplay style, but it just isn't fun. For me personally at least, and from what I've read many other ""legacy players"" think the same. Really hope that some of the current issues are resolved/changed in the future as I'd really want to recommend and enjoy this game.  I will continue to play this game to see how it evolves when playing it for a longer amount of time. If I change my mind about it, I will update this review accordingly."
55434073,english,1,1128000,"After 34 hours of gameplay and the completion of close to 6 regions, I can safely say that I haven't enjoyed a game this much in years and this is the first game, that I feel deserves my honest review.  First off, the exploration is great, the terrain looks amazing and the points of interest and cities are ususal well spread out making everywhere you go have something to do. There are some quirks in the generation like trees inside plateaus or water rising above the ground levels, but that makes it all the more fun to find and explore.  The combat is... cheesy, especially in the early and sometimes very late game of a region and when playing solo. But I have to say I enjoy it a lot. Finding that edge to make the bosses circle below you, leading them to shrines to quickly respawn, making them repeatedly lose interest in you or letting your friend be the bait. There are many ways to fight them and being creative is the way to go. Fight whichever way you prefer.  Now, the game has gear based progression and region locked gear/items. I've seen many complaints about this, but I don't really see any issues with it. At first glance it looks like it severly limits exploration, but when looking deeper into it, it really promotes detailed exploration within every region. Yes, losing the travel items can be a bit annoying, but once you figure out how to do things, gearing up and advancing in a region can go very quickly. And besides, what's the difference between monsters getting stronger or you getting weaker when moving to the next area? My only complaint is that the artifacts are kind of useless besides just showing them off to friends.  I've played around with the alpha, and I followed wol_lay on twitter for the past years to see how development was going. And I have to agree that, in my opinion, this release did underdeliver considering how long was worked on this game, but whatever the reasons are for this, I'm not blaming wol_lay, it's his project and I think he did an amazing job. Could it be better? Yes, of course, but for €20, this is totally worth it, and if he keeps development up (which we should definitely encourage), maybe this game will even surpass the expectations we had."

You can imagine how hyped we were when the full release of the game had been announced, we had given up all hope at that point but it turns out they didnt drop the game.  Well... coming back to the crushing reality. I wish they had dropped it. We had fun for the first few hours but there wasnt that much more content, they had removed a lot of the stuff we used to love and made the game fun for us. It could've just been a good memory.  We can't change it now, we have this abomination of a ruined game before us and there is nothing to do about it. If we have learned one thing from this experience, then simply not to give Picroma more money.  What a disappointment."
163167641,english,0,1128000,"The game is unfortunately bad. I wanted to like this game, its beautiful cubic world and wildlife, but with so many bad system choices. i cant find enjoyment out of it.   Getting crafting items is a tedious task because i cant find what i need. Every crafting component is scarce, so trying to get into crafting is useless. I would rather have a lot of crafting components across the map and needing a large amount to craft items, than having barley any components and little needed to craft items.  The combat was just bad. i played rouge and tried both the assassin and ninja. found the ninja to be less bad just because of its range attacks. still i found the combat to be a boring hack and slash where you start battles where you and the enemy mindlessly beat on each other until one of you fall.  Progression feels dull. The game has a system where you don't lvl up but you focus on getting better gear. This really isn't in the games favour, because with these different classes i expect to get new abilities as i progress, instead of just using the same abilities with a higher dps number. Having a skill tree would be awesome. This would make me feel like im becoming a better warrior, ninja, etc instead of just getting stronger damage output.  The region system made me absolutely stop playing. When i started the game i did a couple quests to get myself a glider and a boat. i was ready to set out to explore the world and all of a sudden i lost everything. Thats because the game only allow you to use the things you earned in the region it was gained. Imagine if you played breath of the wild and after completing the great plateau and leaving it. You found yourself unable to use the glider or anything until you got the sheikah tower of that region. That is cube world. I expected to get the boat and glider to make future exploration easier but it only does for the region you are in. maybe instead of having it that way. you could make it more like botw where you can get longer stamina, so that you can glide for a longer period. There are so many other ways to balance this better, than to take our stuff away from us.  From what i heard the dev is focusing on a successor that is supposed to take aim at making the alpha version a complete game. My only wish is that the people who bought this game doesn't have to buy the new one as well. This cube world game is not worth its 20 dollars, So i hope cube world omega is either going to be an update to this version or given to the people who bought this cube world for its 20 dollar price."

EDIT: Now there's that BetterProgression mod, and honestly this is what saved the actual game and experience, somehow making it better. Yet still, if a game needs mods to be playable, how does that give Picroma any credibility as a developer?  Before I start I'd like to mention that I also was an Alpha player, and this review will be heavily nostalgia-biased.  I remember getting this game 6 years ago. I remember actually playing the Alpha and doing so a lot even before the official release, throughout those 6 years. The info about the release was.. Astounding, and very sudden. It felt like a dream come true. That one, great RPG that was part of my teenhood was great and seeing that it was about to get a full release was great too.  I did not take part in the beta though. I dared to say I wanted to wait for the official release. Damn, I was brave enough to ignore all spoilers, the Reddit and the whole Cube World community so I could get the best experience on release as possible.  Sadly, I was disappointed. I told my friends to purchase the game so we could play multiplayer and that it would be an amazing experience, because the Alpha was great. But we've gone through a bad optimisation issue, Syncing was a pain, and the land generation (should we speak about generation at all actually?) took more than 3 minutes so we could move forward. A ping of ~5000ms was common.  With this, we quit multiplayer. Quite a disappointing outcome. All I saw was an RPG Roguelike becoming... Just a Roguelike. But not that, let me go for some things that I managed to see while playing Singleplayer:  - What first picked my mind when watching the game trailer was the lack of an XP bar. I first thought ""Yeah, that's fine, they probably just hid it somewhere"". Nothing more wrong. When I launched the game, I noticed that experience has gone COMPLETELY, while replacing it with some ""artifacts"". What's more, you'd expect them to incease your stats, but in fact those are some visual, exploration-related bonuses, that are so small you would not even notice.  - Region item lock. Seriously? This game in Alpha used to be about exploration, why is it supposed to punish us, the players, for wanting to explore? In the end I found out that my gameplay stopped at the first region I ended up in, and stuck there with all the equipment. Apparently there are some ""+"" items, that are allowed to be used in surrounding regions, but yet they're extremely rare (~1/50 chance) and not entirely worth the grind.  - Item rarity going from literal rarity to Tierness. You begin from Tier white, while beating stronger enemies and working through these tiers up to the highest, yellow level, defeating the original purpose of RPG and grinding in general.  - The skill tree being removed completely.  - The Hang Glider becoming even more useless now that you cannot increase it's speed like you did in Alpha with skills. Not to mention the terribly high stamina consumption.  - The Water Mage and Warrior are even more broken as ever.  - The Mage's hover literally replaces Climbing.  - The enemy AI is completely braindead at times, especially the bigger enemies, not knowing what to do in front of a single, breakable block.  - Progression tied to either RNG or cheesing abilities, usually the second one though, by abusing the aforementioned braindead AI and the surroundings.  - Some bugs that renders the gameplay kind of... Weird.  - The dev had a literal *week* to collect the Beta testers' opinions. What did we, the actual buyers actually get? As far as I'm aware, the exact same game. I'd love to see an actual delay in the release, if I were to get a more complete product that would actually get listened to the players' opinions and feedback.  - Additionally, most of the things Wollay posted on Twitter as teases for the game were not added in the game at all.  That's just a part of what I noticed so far. Wollay, you deceived us all, Alpha players. We were expecting a great update, with new content, with things that would make our gameplay actually engaging and interesting. The Alpha made us expect a better Alpha, but we actually got another game at all. I'm very disappointed to say, that until most of the issues mentioned above are fixed, I may stick to the original, Alpha version.  I do not mean any hate towards Wollay and his work. He did his best to give us the best Cube World experience possible, but I do not understand his way of handling this proces. I am sadly anxious about the future of this game, as no word of his took place after release. Either he just published and panicked due to the negativity or ran away with the money. Either way, we're dealing with an unprofessional dev, and I hope for the best.   Tl;dr A game that did not live up to its expectations, and a dev not having any contact with it's players. Not satisfied, if you're an alpha player, do not buy at all, if you're new, get it when a discount happens."

The voxel-based world, the exploration, and the RPG mechanics all seemed like they were building up to something great. But when the full release finally arrived, it just didn’t live up to expectations.  A lot of the mechanics that made the early version enjoyable were completely changed or removed, and the progression system felt more frustrating than rewarding. Instead of leveling up and growing stronger over time, everything resets whenever you enter a new region, making long-term character development feel pointless.  The world itself is still visually charming, and the movement and combat can be fun for a while, but the game lacks the depth needed to keep players invested. It’s a real shame because the foundation was there for something amazing. Instead, Cube World feels more like a hollow version of what could have been.  If you loved the alpha, you might find some enjoyment here, but be prepared for a very different experience. Otherwise, it’s hard to recommend, especially when so many other open-world RPGs do it better."
185127712,english,0,1128000,Game is completely abandoned and will most likely never be finished.
121875437,english,0,1128000,"The Older this games gets, the worse the reviews are going to get. This game had infinite potential and the game was abandoned twice because the creator couldn't handle criticism. And it only gets worse because the second time he made promises, and it was no longer this fun side project, and when it didn't have everything it originally had and asking alpha players to rebuy the game for a larger price point effectively scammed thousands and thousands of people. I don't have hope for this game coming back.  The game can be fun with mods, removing alot of the issues, but at that point some of the mechanics you are still playing a worse version then the alpha, and because there is definitely gonna be no future content, there still isnt much of a point."
123192628,english,0,1128000,"I love Wallay's work, and it must be very difficult to make a whole game almost by yourself. but this game is not what those who fell in love with the alpha were waiting for. All it needs is an exploration mode. where the world is random and the map is blacked out, and yes. no region lock. I hope this game is still being worked on and he hasn't given up on it, because it has mountains of potential. It's just not there yet unfortunately."
55451452,english,1,1128000,"For the longest time I have been searching for a casual game that I would be able to lean back and play with my friends. From Garry's Mod to Counter-strike, this game fills the void that no other game could. A lot of people are hating on the game because they've waited 6 years for it, and expected something totally different than what they wanted. They expected a masterpiece. Their masterpiece. This game won't fit everyone. It isn't easy. It takes time. People wanted this game to be so many things, and it wasn't what they expected because the game had changed from alpha to now. From a muddle mess to this amazing game. A game meant to bring people together, to fight challenging mobs, get loot, and explore the endless world. This game may not be what everyone wanted, but it is amazing nonetheless. All the people crying about it through their steam reviews are to idealistic to stray from what they WANTED the game to be. Cube World is not perfect, but it is a far cry from a bad game. If you give it time and effort, the game will reward you. Playing both solo and with friends, it isn't impossible. I love this game, and I think that if you are looking for a challenging, casual game to play by yourself or with friends, look no further. Go into this game with a clean mindset. It is a new game, it is not the alpha version from 6+ years ago."
90752168,english,0,1128000,The game is sadly unlike the alpha in pretty much every way. I hope we will get updates to fix this but for now I highly recommend modding the game to enhance the gameplay
55467589,english,1,1128000,"This game is amazing! Now take everything I say with a grain of salt saying as I never played the alpha because I couldn’t get it before it got taken down.  This game is great, but has its downsides. Pros: The game itself looks amazing The soundtrack is lovely The different classes and subclasses means everyone has something for them (for instance Scout and Beserker for me) The way enemies spawn seems better than what the alpha had (I believe the alpha was you spawned at 0 x 0 z and the further you went from 0, 0 the harder the enemies got, versus now regions have all different types of monsters just hanging about and different quests have different levels of monsters) And a whole lot more I could talk about  Cons:  The game has no tutorials, making learning what to do at the start a bit of a challenge if you didn’t play the alpha Items and armor are region locked (excluding artifacts and equipment+) which makes the game less “get good items and blitz the game” and more or less a restart every region.  The region system needs some improvement, the idea itself is good but the execution isn’t too hot, maybe if it were countries that took up the space of like 4 to 6 regions depending on how powerful the country is it would be better  Overall, I still enjoy the game, but there are definitely some things that could be improved, I feel confined to one region until I get good items in that region, but this game applies to a certain type of people and I don’t think it deserves the hate it’s getting, it’s not a bad game it could just use some improvement"
177696319,english,0,1128000,In the alpha it was better than now. the game now not the best with mods it will be playable but its not better than the alpha version. i hope there will be an update or a fix and it will the best again. i miss the alpha.
84324488,english,0,1128000,"The released version of the game is awful. I played the game back in 2013 before it was removed from Picroma's website and had high hopes for the full release. Wollay's bizarre strategy of removing the game from stores for almost a decade was a terrible one. He worked on the game sure, but with no player feedback. It's a game designed for him and him alone. The game is visually stunning that's for sure. That's about all it has going for it in it's current state.  The progression system is awful. Earning XP, leveling up, as well as the Skill Point system were all pruned from the game. The current progression system has you grinding gear like am ARPG, with the caviot of that gear being literally useless outside of the zone it is acquired in. I think this has an interesting Philosophy behind it, but when the game is focused around exploration and finding new zones, it feels terrible. You can spend a dozen hours grinding out the perfect set with just the stats you want, but if cross an invisible boundary you might as well have nothing equipped. This makes the game feel pointless. There is no point in killing ANYTHING in the open world. Enemies do not give XP, rarely ever drop items, and the items they do drop are low quality. So you spend most of the game just avoiding everything. The world feels hollow. The only way to get gear is by going to towns, talking to NPCs until they give you a map location to clear. The skill point system in the Alpha was atleast interesting as you could tailor your character towards a specific build, whereas in the full version of the game, the only improvements you can make to your character are how hard and fast you can auto attack.  Another thing of note is the difficulty of the game. There is no tutorial in game and very limited UI. The default UI has your only ability cooldown tucked into the bottom left corner of the screen, when your health, MP, and your focus are all going to be towards the center. You spawn in the wild right after making your character which is pretty flush and seamless, but if you're a new player, you'll quickly come to realize you don't know what to do. Again, this gives me the impression this is just Wollay's personal game that no one else is supposed to enjoy, let alone play. Any friend I've had try the game has quit within two hours of playing it due to the terrible new player experience. The enemy AI is terribly overpowered. Ranged and magic using enemies literally cannot miss so combat revolves around doing more damage to them before they kill you. The final nail in the coffin for me was the boomerang enemies. When they throw their boomerang, it has aggressive tracking and hardly ever misses, even with immunity frames while rolling. If and when it connects it doesn't return but instead glues onto your character doing constant damage for around 5 seconds. It only takes 2 boomerang throws to kill a newly created character. If your character is a boomerang user, it functions much differently to the point where you question if your boomerang is just cosmetic. Magic uses suffer a similar issue when they cast a tornado spell it moves along with the character they're targeting causing it to never miss, whereas when your character can cast tornado spells if you move your mouse even slightly the entire spell cancels. Somehow Wollay made the enemy AI worse to the point of being irredeemable.  It's really sad that the limited Alpha version of the game feels like it's had much more work and love put into it than the full release version with almost a decade to get the vision down. I hope Wollay reads some feedback for once and gets this game on track. It has a lot going for it. It's gorgeous and the core RPG concepts themselves have potential. It's like watching your crush get a train ran on her. Like why is she even at this party in the first place, she was such a good girl and could be with such a good guy but instead she's getting railed in exchange for xanax and alcohol."

Mechanics from the early days i do miss but the game now is still very solid. I hope for the game to come back alive with more updates soon maybe even steam deck availability. Ive got plenty of new ideas for the game if youd be interested for updates Picroma. To anyone else reading ignore the bad reviews and give the game a try i promise its worth it."
114266002,english,0,1128000,The developer decided to put the game on steam and then never do anything with it. He took a bunch of peoples money and never updated the game. Dont buy it.
84122310,english,1,1128000,"The game is tolerable after you mod it. And even then it's a little questionable. Cute aesthetic.  I hope the mods fix the ridiculously HP'd enemies, terrible combat style, the weapon limitation per specialization, and the laser beam attacks that you can't dodge. An enemy shouldn't have 16k HP .____. Idk why that is a thing.   Mod's seem to region lock and help in enemy scaling but even then I seem to frequently get my shit rocked by a snail if i step two feet outside of the village.  The quests and aesthetic is great, I just wish it was more scaled/fair so that we aren't constantly dying."
176631585,english,1,1128000,"This game is a pretty decent game. The game definitely took a wrong turn whilst in development and it shouldve stayed more  closer to the alpha. The game is probably not worth 20 dollars but its still an extremely fun game if you have the dedication to play it. There are some huge flaws with the game that cause people to not buy it. 1. All players are on the same server with different regions and biomes, the problem with this is that players can spawn in a biome with insanely strong enemies and be very stuck. 2. All your equipment and gear downgrades to practically shit once you leave the region it was found in. 3. the leveling system is terrible consisting of collecting ""artifacts"" which barely increase any of your stats such as +3% climbing speed. Now for the upsides. 1. The graphics are amazing and the art and design is great. 2. the gear system i personally think is more improved than the alpha version as now its a star system instead of +1 2 3 etc. 3. Your given a wide verity of weapons to chose from 3 for each class each with its own attack speed, right click attack, and some of them you can dual wield. In short, Cube World steam version had almost achieved a perfect game but it strayed too far from the alpha, if you have a spare 20 dollars spare and looking for a grindy game, this is the game for you. (or if you want free just search up on google for alpha)"
175409709,english,0,1128000,"Really good concept but unfortunatly i cant recomend this as it is just a lvl 1 grinding simulator for every new area you go into. you dont ever feel like you get genuinly powerful and the few items that can scale across zones, + items, are random drops with no consistent way to get them ie. crafting questing etc. over all cool game idea but poorly executed and from reading some of the other reviews you may have seen that the prealpha was pretty fun and a good experience but this is just disapointing at the current state of it and im 90% sure they aren't updating it anymore, truely sad, not worth the $25 NZD."
178964740,english,1,1128000,"I played this game in the Alpha version a pretty long tome ago, so I have nostalgic memories of Cube World. I played it recently and bought the steam version and here's what I have to say about Cube World in general:  I truly believe this game likely would have been a titan in the ""block game"" category if the creator didn't take a hard left turn when updating it past alpha to put on steam. Alpha world generation is peak world generation, the game was simple and had an addictive gameplay loop. Improving skill trees, adding human companions, improving village generation (or making a quest based generation) could have been implemented to make the game perfect.  Cube World Steam Version changes the main gameplay loop entirely. crafting materials are rarer and loot drops are better, and there is no level restriction on equipment. The new gameplay loop is kill bosses, loot better gear, kill more bosses. The objective of Steam Version is to collect ""Artifacts"" around the biomes which give random improvements to abilities. Leaving a biome removes all the items collected and ""resets"" your character. This is a literal gameplay ""Loop."" Once you complete the first area, you have to do the exact same thing again from the bottom. Dying in steam version also sucks. Even with gear equal to the boss, you are still extremely likely to die if you don't cheese the boss. respawn areas are 1-3 entire minutes away from boss locations, so you are stuck holding W and maybe scrolling on your phone for 3 minutes just to die immediately and do it again. This is where I stopped playing Steam Version, fighting the highest level enemy with the highest level equipment and losing multiple times.   The alpha version is a craft/loot combination exploration game. You start out extremely weak, dying to every wild animal. Finding crafting materials and fighting the few enemies you can defeat lets you get better armor and use the very limited skill tree. Killing the bosses scattered around the map provides you with special crafting materials for weapons and a bunch of exp. As you level up, you can craft better gear and equip better gear. That is the gameplay loop of alpha Cube World. Craft and equip gear to kill difficult bosses, level up, craft more gear and fight more bosses. The distance between bosses in alpha is still obscene, but there are respawn points 15 seconds away from every boss, and the areas in between are filled out better with ore, crafting materials, and radiant bosses.  I really wish this game was moddable. Sadly, it seems that the developer made a lot of the code and programs very unfriendly to modders. The 4-5 mods for this game are not true scripted mods, but are instead mods that change 1 or 2 numbers of a variable.  Heres how I suggest enjoying cube world:  1. Buy the steam version and play it for a few hours. Don't hurt the developer because you don't like how they manage their game, they still deserve support for creating the game you are playing.   2. Look for the alpha version download online. Download that version and play it for a few hours as well. The game is very hard in the start because everything can kill you, so don't get discouraged right off the bat. There is little skill mechanics in the game, enemies auto lock attacks, have super far reach and attack faster than you can dodge. You are required to get better equipment to defeat enemies."
90147833,english,0,1128000,"Like many others, I played the alpha version and loved it. I achieved thousands of levels because of it and it stayed interesting  because of it's uniqueness of graphics and gameplay. I understand that the full release had to live up to the success of the Alpha but it tried too hard to be unique that it ultimately failed. The mechanic where different regions have a ""lock"" on your gear is, in my opinion, stupid. I can spend hours grinding for good gear in one area, but when I decide to explore this vast world some more, the game punishes you by locking your items. This game that promotes exploration with its vast, open world and many enemies also contradicts itself by essentially taking away all the gear you worked hard for at first. You can for sure fix these problems with mods, but players shouldn't have to fix a games problems themselves. I bought this game when it first came out on steam however so I didn't have much options when it came to mods. In short, buy the game if you don't care about downloading a few mods; normal vanilla gameplay doesn't do it for me though."

I was, of course, playing the alpha build of the game,. Hundreds of hours of gameplay and I was still finding tings completely new to me. I remember freaking out the first time I ever found a portal. I was mind blown. I was amazed. I had absolutely fallen for this game. It became a ritual of mine to search online forums and social media for any trace of the game, and its future updates.   This is one of my all time favorite games. But not like this. Not in this state. This ""completed"" Cube World is nothing at all like what I spent countless hours on. I do NOT recommend this version of Cube World. The only reason I purchased and kept the game was to try to pay Wollay back for the enjoyment I received from the alpha build. Seeing this game in the state it is now leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, and I will forever be heartbroken for what Wollay has done do his beaitufl creation.  All that being said, if anyone wants the alpha build of the game, I am more than willing to share with you on Google Drive. I would recommend Alpha 1000x before this full release. Since the game is ""completed"" now, and the alpha version is lost to time, the only way to receive it is to either pirate it or have it shared.

No Level up system, region lock items, no enemy level scaling, no skill tree. They completely killed the awesome progression the game had and the feeling to explore the world. I would like to know from the dev if he really thought that region locking items would be a good move and everyone would like it. This game completely sucks at its current state, you don't even have a motivation to move to another region and explore the map. It's completely dumb the way items and equipment work now. I played the alpha version till lvl 365 and now I can't even play one hour straight without ragin the entire system. Just don't buy it.

89728595,english,0,1128000,"[For anyone who played Alpha/Beta]. Review given on 4-4-2021. In short: Do not recommend to buy this game BEFORE 2022 as some people claim the developer is still working on this game(If that even is true?).  My review: Remember the skill tree? GONE Remember the proper item crafting? GONE Remember the farming system where you had to find certain characters to get items? GONE  I [b]LOVED[/b] the Alpha and beta. If you see the game and are wishing to still try it out. Don't, its a different game now. Whats new: - No leveling/skill tree, just plain skill (exept for the first hour since EVERYTHING can kill you untill you find at minimum 1 legendary item) - Items are just farming a region. Take a biome of minecraft in mind and take that size, thats ur play size. If you get a FULL legendary set, it's [b]LITERALLY[/b] useless, since everything that is legendary in THAT specific region is BASIC in another region/biome. Once you find 1 or 2 legendary items, you can kill anything so it's creating boring fights. This means in EVERY biome, you must basically START OVER (Stats change the moment u enter the biome or go back). This is basically a run, farm and then do it over again, there is NO progress to be done if you are finished with farming items.   As much as i wanted to feel the nostalgia and was thinking: ""It can't be THAT bad, it's probably still a fun game"". Believe the other people. Oh, and they removed the nice dungeons that went down in the ground.  Feel sad that i figured out the game is more dead then i imagined.. :("

The region locking mechanic and the slow start (hour or two of just running around, hoping you can find a piece of equipment that allows you to actually do something), make the game excruciatingly boring. Then, after you swap regions, you have to do it all again. It's tedious, boring, and insanely grindy. Not to mention, the long term rewards you get are useless, since the stuff it goes towards gets taken away from you each region anyways.

I tried so damn hard to make something positive out of this game for 24 hours of gameplay here, and i bet my left buttcheek 100+ on the alpha, and failed.   Cube world, created by a German company Picroma, was a spin-off to Minecraft back in 2011-2012 when cube games where the stuff, and open world random-gen sandboxes thrived both singleplayer-wise and multiplayer-wise.  After about 2 months of sales of the alpha on Picroma's website, the site has been overloaded by a supposed DDoS attack on the store, making the game unpurchasable and traumatising one of the developers to hide for 6 years with only two windows on the outside world: Their Twitter accounts.  For six years, every month or so, Wolay or Pixxie were to drop in a sneak peek of what is to come to the game, the Harps, new enemies, new dungeons or quest systems, many things! How hyped we have been since we got each piece of the puzzle!  Wollay and Pixxie pretty much has created a cult out of the fanbase, waiting for their messiah to give them a lesson in their religion. And as every cult, not every one was satisfied with a prayer or a teaching... we had extremists.  People literally have sent the guy hate mails, threats, hate comments, sadly not every fan was over 15 at the time... Me neither lol, But i'd never send something  like that to a talented guy.  Critique sent to Wollay did not have much response, but was enough to create an unofficial discord, were people rallied to help the guy out and send him some more deserved motivation by sending a smiley or some stuff...   off to the game now:  Six years since then has passed, and I ahve been greeted by a GIGANTIC steam advert that CUBEWORLD is COMING OUT. THIS SEPTEMBER. OH. MY. GOD.  2012 kiddo has been revived in my soul, and went to an override.  Cubeworld on an updated version of the engine, with new stuff, new adventures... MUSIC (ThANK GOD! This game was a mute back then!) and an ability to play with friends via steam!  Then you input your hard-earned (or hard saved) bucks on the title, you downlaod it... (200MB! HAH) And run it! You are greeted by a blue fog of war, the classic in that universe, the engine after 6 years still can't comprehend rendering....  Okay, not bad! you are in the game, made yourself the water mage (Like the ol'school days) Aaaand you get greeted by the unknown.  Mechanics have changed.  -there is no skills anymore, everything is unlocked since the beginning. -money is different, each enemy drops a coin or two, no matter what tier. -there is no XP anymore, just the wierd artifacts with permanent movement buffs (which are utterly useless, I don't want +1% swim speed) villages feel uglier than before, instead of nice, pastel coloured cities we have villages now, soviet-russia grade.   and here goes the fun part...  *cricket noises*  Oh yeah. THERE AINT ANY!  You don't really progress your character, except the artifact unlocks, which are hidden inside a top-tier dungeon in every region.  Oh. Yeah. Remeber that sword you have dropped on the way? or the boat you havefound after 20 minutes of walking and 30 minutes of respawning back in the latest respawn point?   ITS GONE AFTER YOU CROSS THE BORDER OF THE REGION!  Yep. Tools disappear, you in two oceans regions? Nuh uh, magic border-patrol locks your boat back in the region it came from!  TL;DR: game has lost it's golden nuggets, and decided to paint droplets of crap with a golden spraypaint. And Wollay?  He's out. And as much as I am sad,  I hope he won't come back to CubeWorld.

92080681,english,1,1128000,"TLDR: Don't play if you're a beta user - it's not going to fill the gap in your heart. If you have no prior experience with Cube World, give it a shot.  Okay, so first of all something needs to be clarified. Most of the negative reviews are from people who played the game back in the early alpha/beta stages and miss the mechanics designed back then.   The game is fairly good, my wife and I had a great time playing it together, albeit somewhat simpler in its current form than those complaining desire. I would encourage you to come to it with an open mind, and remember that it is only for $20.   Pros: -The game feels great to explore in, similar to minecraft. The world is breathtakingly beautiful even though it's simple voxels.  -The pets are cute and finding them and giving them the right food feels great.  -Enemies are challenging in each section until you get decent gear, and you have to re-gear in each zone. (This becomes monotonous after more than 2 zones.) -Co-op. -Certain quests feel rewarding (such as saving a village which is petrified.)  Cons: -Re-gearing in new zones can be frustrating. -20 hours or less, even with the massive world. -Most quests begin to feel like repeats, and lack decent rewards. -Entering a new area forces you to find new lassos/gliders/flutes etc. Losing these items reminds you how crucial they are and can be irritating.  There are four classes, each with their own weapons/style. I recommend water mage for newbies - healing is very helpful early on. (You change your subclass in a village.)   It's certainly not a bad game, especially for the price."
187755467,english,0,1128000,"Played the og. Was waiting for YEARS for it to release. Finally did, and Woolay abandoned it.  Gameplay loop is crap. You farm and farm and farm for gear, go to a new area and suddenly your gear is utterly useless.  It's cute, and I was really hoping for the game to actually be fully fleshed out, have constant updates etc etc but no. Woolay has gone dark since the release. So many other solo indie devs that communicate with their fans and add updates. Shame Woolay isn't one of them."
67456249,english,0,1128000,No support from sole dev.  He really messed up a fun game and then disappeared.  Seems like a quick money grab.  Dont buy unless he comes back and fixes it.
190410025,english,0,1128000,"Such a disappointment. I still think about this game, and even consider going back sometimes, and I’m always immediately reminded why I never should. A absolutely atrocious progression system completely ruins the experience of this game. Everything you do feels pointless because once you leave your current zone, all of your progress is completely wiped away. I hope one day the developer comes back and tries something new with this, because there is so much lost potential here."
92385282,english,0,1128000,"EDIT: Wollay is now working on a new update called Cube World Omega. The new additions and returning Alpha elements sound very promising. I'm looking forward to seeing what he has in store for us. Despite my harsh criticism I do enjoy Cube World and want both it and Wollay to succeed. I will post a new review once this next major update is out. Fingers crossed and good luck Wollay.  Even with a copious amount of mods to fix some of the biggest issues, this is one of the biggest disappointments I have ever purchased and experienced. Wollay dropped the ball hard and the only person he can blame is himself. Turning his back on the community doomed this game. Several straight up boneheaded decisions like region locking items and horrible excuses for progression sucked all the fun out of this simple but charming game. If you are at all interested in this game, go play the alpha from 2013. It is much more fun and rewarding than this boring and frustrating experience. Hopefully Wollay will eventually fix and atone for his mistake and take responsibility. He needs to take the feedback and feelings of the community seriously instead of running away with his tail between his legs again."

I started playing for a bit but it felt different. So, I searched online what happened... All I'm going to say if you're reading this. There is still hope out there for you and this project.

If you really want this game go for it, but don't buy it at normal price ( since its clearly overpriced) and 1st check when the last update was made, if it hasn't been touched  since released chances are it wont be touched for another 6 years ( time is heavily dependent on how long the money he made lasts)."
144198815,english,0,1128000,"Before this game came to Steam, and before the major update that took the developers 20 years to release, this game was worth every penny. Sure, it had it glitches and bugs, but it was a game in-development. Now, I believe that saying this game is still under development is a tragic understatement. Before the update, you didn't have to worry about your weapons and armor no longer being effective because you went to a new area on the map. While fighting was challenging, it was not impossible, and you could actually kill stuff. Remember when you would kill something and get experience for it? For some reason, that was taken out, eliminating one of the biggest ways to level up. Now, the only way you can level up is accepting quests that will take you to incredibly difficult dungeons that are so far up the leveling scale, you'd have to be hopelessly addicted to this game just to attempt to be high enough level to take those dungeons on. The mages are still OP as hell, you can no longer buy the gliders and boats from the shops, you now have to go and FIND them. Characters you create are now tied to their own worlds, so you can no longer create your own worlds. Finding gear for your character's class is hopelessly rare, whereas before the update you could just find a landmark, drop the gear you couldn't use, hop onto another character that could use that gear, go to that landmark, and give that character that gear. Not anymore. There isn't even a mailing system where you could send stuff to another character of yours.  Don't waste your money on a game that only got worse after a major update the devs spent too long to release. This game was amazing once, now it's just a hopeless grind with OP enemies, and crappy leveling. How I wish there was a pre-update version of this game. But, just like with everything else we were hoping to see in the new update: it'll never happen."
55469836,english,0,1128000,"If you're thinking of buying this because of seeing videos of Alpha gameplay, don't, it's entirely different and almost nothing like the Alpha. It's essentially just running around trying to figure out what to do for 2 hours, before finally realizing you need to do quests to do anything at all, realizing you need to cheese every boss or have extremely over the top gear from cheesing a high level enemy, and then losing everything you've gained the moment you travel too far. Just save your money until it's fixed, which it most likely wont be."

Everything gone except for a useless ""artifact"" that only made my lamp shine a little brighter.  I'm sorry but the alpha had more content then the game does right now. Before there was much more to do with an exp system (not to mention the oceans are literally EMPTY husks. Before there were fish, now there's seemingly NOTHING in there)  Its depressing what happened to this game. I honestly hope it's an experimental release or something along those lines. All those years just to have my expectations(which honestly if he just added some needed changes to the old game, I would have been fine with) completely shattered. I know this sounds like a self centered review but this is just how I feel about it. It's not what I played a couple years ago. :/  Not to mention, every zone your practically doing the same thing over and over, just with a different name and zone look. No variety."

Skill trees, abilities and the sense of progression have been removed. The game to me is unplayable and joyless.  I am very tempted to refund the game but I am hoping that Wolfram can come back from the ether he has disappeared into, show some signs of life, speak up and see the criticisms.  Please fix this burning pile of a game."
109349492,english,1,1128000,"On It's own the game is a shadow of it's former alpha. But with mods slightly tweaking the games core, it can turn into an adventure that no other game can give you. There's plenty of open world space, fun fights, awesome loot. Overall a very good experience."
118979516,english,1,1128000,"I will recommend with one large asterisk: play with mods. I did try it without mods first and knew beforehand what I was getting into because I did some research on the game. I never played the alpha but it seems most preferred the game in that state. Without mods there is no leveling and you are more or less restricted to a zone because of the way gear works. Yes, you can explore to your heart's content, however it is nearly fruitless because you can explore and get your gear worked up pretty nicely in zone X only for it to become useless in any other one.  The mods I have used (I found them posted in the discuss section) reintroduced leveling and a host of other things that were apparently supposed to be in the finished game. Gear is still lightly tied to zones and will suffer a downgrade when entering a new area but it doesn't become completely useless.  It is a fun game but I suspect if you aren't very interested in modding your games you will likely become bored because of stark limitations of gameplay. It is also pretty tough and you will probably have to grind out very weak mobs to get at least a couple levels before being able to do much like craft some armor and a better weapon. I haven't been using guides or anything but as a mage I found I can cheese quite a bit by staying on tree tops and using magic. Doesn't work 100% of the time as some enemy projectiles (and your own magic) can break foliage and leave you tumbling to the ground if you aren't careful. You can almost fly (better than using a Hang Glider you find) by using your float ability: jump, hit float, then rapidly tap it as you sail in a direction you want. It keeps you fairly horizontal in the direction you wish to go.  Been having some fun with it even though it really does require some mods to get longevity out of it."
191086850,english,1,1128000,"Cube World is a decent game in its current state, but man it could have been so much more. I remember playing the alpha years ago and being super hyped for a full release. The current state of the game with its zone locking shenanigans makes it fun for the first handful of hours, but when you begin going to new zones and have your good gear suddenly become worthless it kinda loses steam. I really wish Wollay stuck around through all the backlash and really polished this game up to perfection À la No Man's Sky. The only other game that comes close to Cube World's style is Trove, but Trove is an MMO and doesn't really play the same. I wish steam had a option for leaving a mixed review for games like this."

121553204,english,0,1128000,"Abandoned Game. A shame really.  Dev took the money and ran, which is really sad since this clearly had potential. Its not like its a bad game, but people waited 6 Years for this after the Alpha released 2013, only to get a game that is arguably less finished than before somehow.   They completely scrapped the well liked Progression System from the Alpha of the Game. Instead we now have essentially region locked gear and levels. When you leave the Area you got your gear from, it downgrades it to abyssmal stats, making it unusable. As you can guess, this is a very... questionable feature in a Game with infinite world generation.   A lot of the stuff the Dev of this game promised and teased is simply not in the game.  Im talking big cities, certain kinds of dungeons, skilltrees etc.  You know, the good stuff people actually wanted.  Furthermore, you`ll need a playlist. Since the music in this game, while not sounding bad at first, starts giving you a headache after around ~30mins. Every song sounds the same with slight changes or one different instument. It just gets on your nerves after a while.  If you plan on playing this in Multiplayer, i have bad news for you.  It simply doesnt work. Desyncs, random disconnects, people not showing up despite being online, friends not being able to join for no reason etc.  Big servers with 100+ people like back in the Alpha are not a thing anymore. Gone are the days of 30 People teaming up to kill a +4 Legendary monster.   As you can guess from this review, i am really dissapointed.  Especially since this could have been amazing if the Dev just expanded on the already successfull Alpha.   This is a perfect example of: ""If it aint broke, dont fix it."" Overall: 2/10  Rather play the unfinished Alpha."
64326307,english,0,1128000,"I enjoy my time playing Cube World. I think for the first couple hours you have a character and you are learning, or relearning the game, is a real treat, but after you've done your first region it just goes downhill from there. I feel like I'm speed-running the next couple regions. I ask myself ""why am I subjecting myself to this boredom and displeasure?"" so I stop playing. But somehow it seems the I'm always drawn back. I think if you were there for the hype of the game; you should buy it just to see what it really is lie for yourself, but if you are totally new to the game; don't buy it. It will only cause you to be frustrated and hate the game."

88814778,english,0,1128000,"This game had potential, but the developer is a complete diva who throws online tantrums. This game suffered at his hands the way minecraft did with Notch; an overly controlling entrepreneur who wants to produce THEIR vision. There are new systems that drain the fun from the game. The cool generated castles and dungeons are gone. NPC's spout one of half a dozen madlib phrases. ""I'm going to be the greatest <class> in the land!"" Good for you, you wafer thin attempt at content!  Lets talk about the elephant in the room: per-land gear. This has to be one of the least well thought out ways to artificially stretch the content out. Gear crafting allows you to add a voxel to your weapon, but the crafting has all the depth of a teaspoon.  This should be my favorite game ever. As a minecraft, zelda and d&d player this is like the venn diagram intersection! The formula is gold, as proven by the alpha! But the poor choices in the games design are astoundingly dumb, and turn this into a waste of money. I really hope this gets sold to a professional developer, or is saved by mods, but I'm not holding my breath."

Its worth a good 10-15 hours of fun playtime (would be much longer without region locking), and I think at a discount this game is worth buying.

55402227,english,1,1128000,"Hey, after 6 years of silent, we actually get to play Cube World. And I'll be honest. I enjoyed it. Even though I recommended Cube World, I'm not saying this game didn't have a flaw, it's a big one as well. But let go over the good thing I found first. + The environment is great. Everything look very lively and colorful, making exploring alone fun and enjoyable. + The game greatly present exploring. The more you explore the stronger you become, but that doesn't mean you would become overpower, as you explore more zone, the more adaptive the game become. As you can't use the same gear in another zone (Not including Plus Gear of course) you need to explore more if you want to get stronger, which allow you to explore even more terrain. + The artifact is very interesting, to actually level up, you need to explore. Gathering as much information as possible to locate the artifact. The artifact as a concept act more like a treasure hunt rather than a progression.  Now that we're done with the pros, now for the flaws. - The game is very unbalance. When you start the game, you will die a lot, as most monster actually one shot you if you get too close, and fighting against range enemy at first feel like hell, especially mages as their move are strong as hell. If you challenge a strong enemy at first. You do not stand a chance. But once you get rarer gear, it only get much more powerful the more you go. Even you yourself is unbalance, some skills is actually hella broken. The example of this is Ranger Scout Subclass Ultimate. The quicksands is so strong as the move slow the enemy, let them take more damage, and have hilariously low cooldown of 40 seconds, and the cooldown actually start when you activate the ability, not when it disappear. You can actually beat a level 5 melee boss with the starter gear by abusing this skill. And that just cheating. - The game is lacking motivation, once you get stronger gear, you become too powerful in that zone, but once you change area, your gear immediately become useless, being weaker than a level 1 gear in that zone. Seeing this, most people get discourage about exploring, and just play in that area until they're bored and stop playing. The artifact, even if it fun to find it, still doesn't have enough impact to make people think exploring is important. - This is the biggest flaws of the game, it's very repetitive. There are difference between repetitive and replayable, and Cube World lean into repetitive rather than replayable. Each time you explore into different area, you are having a different experience, but it's the same, you make a gear, fight something until you get better gear, get the best gear, beat all the dungeons and quest in that area, get information for artifact, then change area. And you do that everytime, and yes, there is something different each time, but the main thing is always the same.  Looking at my review, you may think the game isn't fun. But you need to try it. The game may miss progression and motivation, but the game is enjoyable, everything pros blend in together perfectly and with a little more love and care, this game can clearly be a masterpiece. And hey, maybe this will be another no man sky fiasco, who know?  In Conclusion, This game may not be the best. But you cannot find any experience like it anymore. You may enjoy it or not, but that doesn't stop this game from being fun. I encourage everyone to pick up the game and try it for themselves. If you enjoy it, great! If not, well, leave a review!"

55516502,english,0,1128000,"Basically everything it was good for was removed, and most of the stuff shown during development - not added. This game is a good example of what happens when you don't communicate with the people who follow the development as much, basically making the game alone and not even testing it.

55452432,english,1,1128000,"If you have never played a previous version of Cube World before, please read this review:  The reason the reviews are mixed as of now is because a lot of players who played Cube World in the alpha version are unhappy at the state of the game at release. This is because the level progression system changed since alpha, as well as other game-changing factors. Ultimately, their expectations were high then suddenly dropped.  Now let me review this game as somebody who has never played Cube World prior to my purchase 3 days ago:  This game does have an interesting leveling system - yes. Each region contains at least one artifact that you get through exploring the region, talking to people and obtaining better gear. This artifact gives you a slight upgrade to something. This is your level progression. Most gear doesnt transfer  over to other regions meaning you have to start the grind all over again. To me, this is a lot of fun. I enjoy the unique system this game follows. This system definitely is not for everyone though.   Another aspect of the game I enjoy is the exploration. Exploration is forced, but thats what you would expect from an open world, adventure game. The exploration in this game in my opinion is done so well that I never get bored wandering around. I could do so for hours. The adventure and scenery in this game gives it a truly magical appeal that puts me in a positive mood. Not to mention this game has the best map function I have ever witnessed in a game.   To conclude, this game is a magical experience full of superlative adventure and hours of content. The level system is different, but not difficult to get used to. As off-putting as most reviews for this game are, try not to let that change your viewpoint on the game, since a lot are biased towards a previous version. As somebody playing this game for the first time, I absolutely recommend this game if you are looking for an exciting adventure."

190398560,english,0,1128000,"Game was completely reworked from the previous version disregarding everything it had and left to rot once again, the developer doesn't seem to care much about consumer opinion, disregard this game and go back to the alpha version."

61774691,english,1,1128000,"I need to preface this with the following; unmodded, Cube World is awful. But installing the mods required to fix the progression system is incredibly easy, which results in an infinitely superior experience.  The lack of a proper XP system was a bit of a let down at first, but having experienced the progression at its best, I can safely say I'm fine with it. Early game is hell but once you start accumulating power, shit hits the fan fast. Exploration is entertaining and satisfying, though the whole map being revealed from the start is a puzzling decision. The relic system is cool as well and combos effectively with the various stats your gear can grant, and the payoff for the lore is entertaining. Without region lock and with proper progression scaling as you move further away from where you started, Cube World is everything I'd hoped it would be. These two small changes fix the game in so many ways and the resulting experience is, IMO, a ton of fun.  Now for stuff that applies to the base game. Dungeons are fun to explore, enemy variety is extremely good and solid, and the landscapes are absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. My only complaints is, again, the whole map being revealed; it should reveal itself as you explore more segments of the world.  Make no mistake, the developer goofed hard, but the effort of the community to make it better makes it worth a buy in my honest opinion."
165255405,english,0,1128000,"I've wanted to enjoy this so bad since it launched on steam but it's just so annoyingly bad.  For starters, there is no clear cut leveling system. All of your stats are tied to your gear that you find/craft. There's no experience points and no abilities or talents to work towards unlocking. The latter isn't necessarily bad, but having access to all your class abilities from the start is slightly boring. It's an RPG with no skills to unlock. it feels weird.  The enemy scaling is terrible. You could start a new character, see some bugs in the distance you think you can take on and then be dead 10 seconds after attacking them.   Your gear is region locked. If you enter a new zone you have to re-obtain special equipment (boat, glider, etc.) for that zone and all of your gear gets downgraded. Did you spend a long time obtaining/crafting the best gear you could? Better get ready to do it all over again cause it will be useless if you enter a new region! And because your stats are tied to your gear (since there's no exp based leveling system) you're basically level 1 when you enter a new region!  Traveling becomes kind of annoying after a while. You will either need to find and tame a ride-able pet to speed you up or spend gold on flight paths.  Good luck trying to progress if its night time in game. This game is so unreasonably dark you cannot see anything. Your lantern does not provide enough light. Oh, and there is no brightness setting to crank up to get around this issue. So there's that.  Word gen customization. In the Alpha version of the game you could enter custom seeds for your world generation which was neat. That feature is gone now in this version. There aren't even world slots for you to use. It just assigns a world to your character and that's that.  This game had such potential to be amazing. A lot of people loved the alpha release, but the developer took so many steps in the wrong direction with this.  Don't buy the game. Not worth it unless the dev comes back from the dead to finish it. If you really want to play it though, make sure you mod it. I recommend trying CubeMegaMod. It's one of the few mods that are still compatible with the game."

However I must say I just cannot play it in its current state.  In the 27 minutes I played, my character was chased by red blobs that shot water, a Skull Bull, three giants and a golem. I fought everything I could but just died each time. The game also just....feels no different than the alpha. Hell, the alpha was better and more polished than this is to me. The game feels like you're supposed to fail. The first thing to get; the Glider, was in the middle of a volcano and no matter what I tried I just KEPT dying. Nothing stopped it. I could never get out to it. The animations are unchanged even though there are claims they are polished, and it just feels like a messy game release. We know you needed money back on this investment you made Wollay, but this feels lazy.....  Can I pet dogs? yes. Horses? Yeah. Pigs? Sheep? Cows? YES But can I enjoy myself with any other part of this game at this point? No.  All in all, just wait till it gets updates and patches. Its current state should be listed as a WIP or alpha.

So much promise for nothing in the end"
55856264,english,1,1128000,"Deary me. Here goes. When this game was first released in 2013, together with an unbelievable amount of other blocky voxel games that have been indubitably inspired by the success of Minecraft, I was in my teens. Not having had any means of online payment, I didn't purchase it back then, though I was still moderately hyped from watching some YouTube creators playing it with their mates.   Due to this, I haven't had much in the way of expectations. I didn't know what I was getting, I didn't remember how good it has been. When it was announced that, after six years of development hell, it will be released, I was hyped which is why I got it on Day 1.   First impression... Well, you're not being told anything at all about the mechanics. A player needs to find out everything by themselves, trial and error, due to the lack of a tutorial. Would have been nice to include one.  After having found out about the basics of the game, I encountered the first feature which I immediately disliked. The vast majority of the obtainable items are locked to the region you picked them up in. It would appear that this is a product of the missing progression system. Progression is gathering all items, finishing all mission, completing every dungeon in one region, and start over in the next one. Probably not the best approach. Mages. F*ck mages. They are terribly overpowered. They hard-lock onto your sorry rear and frag you.   After doing some research, I of course found out that there are quite a few features missing from the original, making people rather unhappy, which is understandable. The ""low"" quality of the game is surely a by-product of Wollay's isolation during those six years. The community couldn't give any advice, recommendations, feature requests, etc., of course it isn't exactly what everybody wanted. Those issues can only be sorted out now. We also won't get any updates in the near future, since Wollay has gone MIA, probably dealing with PTSD. I'm certainly worried about him. All the best to Wollay. Concerning the accusations that ""Hur dur dur Wollay has scammed us!""... Are you serious?!?!?! I refuse to believe that this is the sole purpose of this game.  The game needs a few fixes and changes here and there. Some members of the community have made that quite clear, some have been quite toxic while doing that. Not really the best behaviour.  At any rate... I still like this game! It's fun, even if some others have been spoilt by and arguably better version and hence had higher expectations.  [Edit 31-10-19: Minor wording adjustments]"

68029646,english,1,1128000,"I expected to be able to sink as many hours into the game as I did in the Alpha version - unfortunately the region locking has led to my disillusionment with the game and to my choosing to uninstall it after 36 hours.  Simply put, the first two or three regions are fine, fun, fantastic - the discovery elements are great, the combat is solid as the Alpha was, and the pets meant I never felt completely alone despite playing exclusively in singleplayer.  Having gotten ""+ items"" early on, I had no issue with the regions surrounding my initial one, rapidly acquiring the gimmicks that locked content in these new regions (whistle, flute, bell, etc.). However, my enjoyment peaked there due to my losing all progress in the next region, which greatly disheartened me.  I believe there's a mod floating around somewhere (Reddit iirc) that disables the region-lock for reins, gliders, and boats, so I could probably get a bunch more enjoyment out of this game - but I'm in no hurry and I expect I'll revisit it at some point in the future.  With all this said, the base game is still incredibly fun and entertaining - one need only watch some gameplay on YouTube to see how fluid the game is, and in-person one can easily experience all the game has to offer in 2 hours. The main glaring issue remains the region-locking which broke my immersion and ended up making me shun the game, but perhaps others might not be as put off by this as me."
55545463,english,1,1128000,"Wall of text warning, this is getting long!  Honestly, I am having a lot of fun with this game! There is a lot more to it than many would have you believe. And, since I know this is going to be the first question a bunch of you ask, I did play Alpha. And, I like this better.   This is a game that has been designed with two goals in mind, endless adventure and seamless multiplayer, and the systems reflect that. It also seems to reward those who are not in a hurry and spend time gathering crafting ingredients, hunting non-boss mobs, and just generally enjoying the ride. It's not about the destination, if you play it with that mindset you will be very disappointed.  It's a lot of fun to just chill, relax, and adventure, however.  The gear is region-locked, meaning that when you enter a new ""region"" your gear becomes white (drop down to the first tier of gear), and you must find travel gear (boats, hang-gliders, and the like) again. You don't actually lose the old ones, they just don't work for the new region. Your gear also retains it's old properties if you ever want to return to where it's valid again (there is actually a good reason to do this). It even has it's own pages, navigable at the bottom of the inventory screen, to keep it separated from your current region. You may not want to sell your old region gear just yet.  Really, this is not that big a deal to me, and necessary to keep the game from becoming stale. You don't actually completely start over ""at square one"" when the gear resets, you still have all your potions and crafting ingredients, money, pets, and potentially + gear (gear that retains it's bonuses in larger multi-region areas so that it's useful longer). You have more than enough to really make a good start in the new region, and I don't personally find it feels like a whole new character.  Also, NPCs in the new regions still really like my old boots.  What this does do, however, is makes the content in this new region valid. There was this problem that I, and others, found in the Cube World Alpha progression system (similar issues happen in most progression systems if you try to extend them very far), and that was eventually (I found it didn't take all that long) your gear and levels made the game ridiculously easy, and most people just flew around on their hang-gliders looking for dungeons. There were only two main valid locations at that point. Dungeons and towns. This system is in response to issues like that, and has actually been pretty well thought out.  It does feel like a little bit of a let-down when my gear turns white and I am back to killing yard-trash for a while. It would be like this in many other ""normal"" progression systems, too, if you consider that you are now level 15 in a 15-25 region. This is perhaps harder to bear as you have a visible representation in gear color that does feel like you lost something. Still, I know to expect that, and I get the reason.  As mentioned before, + gear exists. This is gear that retains it's qualities in a larger multi-region area (I have seen the dev refer to them as ""Kingdoms"" once, but really don't know much more about them, or how they are defined, it's not obvious in-game). + gear is fairly rare, but after you have completed a region (found all the artifacts) it becomes more common. This is why I say it's a good idea to potentially return to regions you have already completed.  The world is huge. If I understand it right, it is essentially procedurally generated, but we all have the same seed to keep it multiplayer friendly. You start ""somewhere"" in this world and set out from there. It's not, however, like an MMO where you see others and their actions effect your own world. Multiplayer works through the Steam friend system, and you can join your friends in distant regions with free rides from the flight masters.  It is important to understand the difficulty system, and that it matters. There are several colored tiers of gear: white, green, blue, purple, gold. This is probably pretty familiar to many folks from other games. When starting out don't try to take down colored mobs. The quests also are (mostly) colored accordingly (the dungeons seem to register as white, but are not). Your character's current gear is rated similarly, with separate Armor and Weapon ratings. These seem to be pretty accurate indicators of what you can expect to handle, though be mindful of boss mobs. Boss mobs can be scary.  Pay attention to your surroundings. Stronger mobs can be found near weaker ones, but you can usually see them before you wander into them if you are mindful. I was already several hours in before I was killed by something powerful that caught me off-guard, and it seldom happens still.  I find the world is actually much more full than Alpha, though I am sure many would disagree with me. There are many little adventure sites in the wild, ones with mini-bosses and interesting challenges. One theme that seems pretty common is freeing merchant gnomes from things like undead, witches, and necromancers. I may have lucked out in my first region because I have a pile of stuff there, including a couple of Steel Empire airship invasions, and have seen other regions that don't seem nearly that full. Perhaps this is where some of the complaints come from.  Again, if you are the kind of player who likes to crash through content, you probably will want to pass this one by. The quests and challenges can require a bit of footwork to find, talking to villagers, completing other things first, things like that. But, if you are like me, and really like to just get immersed in the world it can be pretty fun. Personally I don't like having everything handed to me on a silver-platter in a nice clean quest-hub or breadcrumb trail. But, I also played EverQuest when it was new and really enjoyed that, as well. I find this easier.  There is no skill tree anymore, and while I don't actually like this, I do understand why the dev would have wanted to remove it. The idea is, I think, that any player can hang with any other player in any region, and this facilitates that goal. It still would have been nice to have potentially a horizontal skill tree, meaning you have access to new abilities, though new abilities that are reasonably balanced with the rest.  This is not to say all mages play the same, or anything like. Each class has a couple of specializations that offer different sets of abilities, and each weapon-type adds more variance to that. Off the top of my head I would say there are 6 ways to play that mage.  The game begins with the whole map revealed, though no details such as town names or quest area names filled in, these you can learn from NPCs or by going there yourself. There are mixed opinions on this since you can spend time inspecting the map to try locate towns and things. I don't mind it, and understand that it is facilitating the multiplayer aspect, as well as the fact you can just say ""I want to go explore a savannah today, let me check my map and catch a flight there.""  Is it a perfect game? No. Is it for everyone? No.  However, if the gameplay I described sounds appealing, and the region locking does not sound like such a harsh thing, it might well be worth trying out. I, and many others, actually like it quite a bit. The reviews on here are a bit skewed as most folks who do like it are scared to review due to the way certain elements in the community react to anything that does not agree with their opinions.  Not saying all the negative opinions are wrong, there are valid arguments, especially giving differing preferred playstyles, and I do agree with some of the criticisms out there. But, there are also people throwing out things like ""It's a scam"", ""The dev is (inset all sorts of nasty things)"", or various other toxic comments. I have also seen several reviews from people that, in my opinion, have not put enough time in to really have a firm grasp of what actually is here."
116164912,english,1,1128000,"Even if some features from the alpha never made it into the release, i still greatly enjoy cube world for what it is, without comparing it to the alpha. I am in favour of the region locking as i'm sure if you kept the best stuff you would just blow through regions with the only challenge coming from the first one. And with the key items, depending on the order you got them you have to traverse the land differently which always keeps things from being the same. Along with the different biomes, structures and dungeons my expectations are always exceeded by some places having completely different designs, especially with the underground places. However, this does not mean i didn't come across a few.. odd things. Graveyard houses with vault doors that require a harp to open only for them to have nothing inside, pillars being in odd places, and many npcs spinning around and on top of cauldrons with gnomes in them, and a few other small things like that. But i think there are so many other great parts of the game that greatly outweigh the bad. so yes i would recommend this game to people, but i would inform them on how it functions to see if the game is really for them. So please, keep on trying, i would love to see some of the things shown like cities and all sorts, if there is ANY hope whatsoever i would love to see this come back better than ever."
120640453,english,0,1128000,"Tbh, quite a disappointment. A lot of the features that were in the early days just scrapped, like dungeons, skills and attributes. It is now just basically a hiking simulator in Voxel graphics.  Don't buy it unless my above statement is incorrect."

55424567,english,1,1128000,"Why am I writing a positive review you may ask me? I don't support Wollay anymore, no if anything he's a jackass for leaving us again. The reason I'm writing a positive and recommending you this game in the future is the modders. The modders of Cube World are hopefully going to fix Wollay's disaster making the game like it was in alpha and hopefully add new mechanics themselves. I'd wait about 2-3 more weeks. Either he comes out of hiding or the modders are just gonna fix the game themselves. The game has potential, it's not a bad game. There's many features that need rework and more content added. I will keep my faith more on the modders to make Cube World great again."

55353405,english,0,1128000,"Used to play the Alpha 6 years ago - I loved it. And before I get hate for disliking the new version: please hear me out. I honestly tried to love this game. Only played the new release myself for about half an hour atm, however I have seen countless of gameplay from the Beta. I conclude that in its current state, Cube World is sadly not worth playing.  The difficulty spike in the beginning, which basically forces you to avoid any combat, is not rewarding at all. Additionally, fighting isn't even encouraged as you don't earn XP from it (???). My main concern however is, that in an RPG which heavily focuses on EXPLORATION, you basically lose all your gear upon entering a new zone.  I can partially see what Wollay was trying to achieve with the gameplay style, but it just isn't fun. For me personally at least, and from what I've read many other ""legacy players"" think the same. Really hope that some of the current issues are resolved/changed in the future as I'd really want to recommend and enjoy this game.  I will continue to play this game to see how it evolves when playing it for a longer amount of time. If I change my mind about it, I will update this review accordingly."
55434073,english,1,1128000,"After 34 hours of gameplay and the completion of close to 6 regions, I can safely say that I haven't enjoyed a game this much in years and this is the first game, that I feel deserves my honest review.  First off, the exploration is great, the terrain looks amazing and the points of interest and cities are ususal well spread out making everywhere you go have something to do. There are some quirks in the generation like trees inside plateaus or water rising above the ground levels, but that makes it all the more fun to find and explore.  The combat is... cheesy, especially in the early and sometimes very late game of a region and when playing solo. But I have to say I enjoy it a lot. Finding that edge to make the bosses circle below you, leading them to shrines to quickly respawn, making them repeatedly lose interest in you or letting your friend be the bait. There are many ways to fight them and being creative is the way to go. Fight whichever way you prefer.  Now, the game has gear based progression and region locked gear/items. I've seen many complaints about this, but I don't really see any issues with it. At first glance it looks like it severly limits exploration, but when looking deeper into it, it really promotes detailed exploration within every region. Yes, losing the travel items can be a bit annoying, but once you figure out how to do things, gearing up and advancing in a region can go very quickly. And besides, what's the difference between monsters getting stronger or you getting weaker when moving to the next area? My only complaint is that the artifacts are kind of useless besides just showing them off to friends.  I've played around with the alpha, and I followed wol_lay on twitter for the past years to see how development was going. And I have to agree that, in my opinion, this release did underdeliver considering how long was worked on this game, but whatever the reasons are for this, I'm not blaming wol_lay, it's his project and I think he did an amazing job. Could it be better? Yes, of course, but for €20, this is totally worth it, and if he keeps development up (which we should definitely encourage), maybe this game will even surpass the expectations we had."

188151124,english,0,1128000,"I started playing way back in the alpha version of the game and we absolutely loved it, it was a game we always came back to often thought about and loved throughout the years eventhough it didnt have much content back then.  You can imagine how hyped we were when the full release of the game had been announced, we had given up all hope at that point but it turns out they didnt drop the game.  Well... coming back to the crushing reality. I wish they had dropped it. We had fun for the first few hours but there wasnt that much more content, they had removed a lot of the stuff we used to love and made the game fun for us. It could've just been a good memory.  We can't change it now, we have this abomination of a ruined game before us and there is nothing to do about it. If we have learned one thing from this experience, then simply not to give Picroma more money.  What a disappointment."
163167641,english,0,1128000,"The game is unfortunately bad. I wanted to like this game, its beautiful cubic world and wildlife, but with so many bad system choices. i cant find enjoyment out of it.   Getting crafting items is a tedious task because i cant find what i need. Every crafting component is scarce, so trying to get into crafting is useless. I would rather have a lot of crafting components across the map and needing a large amount to craft items, than having barley any components and little needed to craft items.  The combat was just bad. i played rouge and tried both the assassin and ninja. found the ninja to be less bad just because of its range attacks. still i found the combat to be a boring hack and slash where you start battles where you and the enemy mindlessly beat on each other until one of you fall.  Progression feels dull. The game has a system where you don't lvl up but you focus on getting better gear. This really isn't in the games favour, because with these different classes i expect to get new abilities as i progress, instead of just using the same abilities with a higher dps number. Having a skill tree would be awesome. This would make me feel like im becoming a better warrior, ninja, etc instead of just getting stronger damage output.  The region system made me absolutely stop playing. When i started the game i did a couple quests to get myself a glider and a boat. i was ready to set out to explore the world and all of a sudden i lost everything. Thats because the game only allow you to use the things you earned in the region it was gained. Imagine if you played breath of the wild and after completing the great plateau and leaving it. You found yourself unable to use the glider or anything until you got the sheikah tower of that region. That is cube world. I expected to get the boat and glider to make future exploration easier but it only does for the region you are in. maybe instead of having it that way. you could make it more like botw where you can get longer stamina, so that you can glide for a longer period. There are so many other ways to balance this better, than to take our stuff away from us.  From what i heard the dev is focusing on a successor that is supposed to take aim at making the alpha version a complete game. My only wish is that the people who bought this game doesn't have to buy the new one as well. This cube world game is not worth its 20 dollars, So i hope cube world omega is either going to be an update to this version or given to the people who bought this cube world for its 20 dollar price."

EDIT: Now there's that BetterProgression mod, and honestly this is what saved the actual game and experience, somehow making it better. Yet still, if a game needs mods to be playable, how does that give Picroma any credibility as a developer?  Before I start I'd like to mention that I also was an Alpha player, and this review will be heavily nostalgia-biased.  I remember getting this game 6 years ago. I remember actually playing the Alpha and doing so a lot even before the official release, throughout those 6 years. The info about the release was.. Astounding, and very sudden. It felt like a dream come true. That one, great RPG that was part of my teenhood was great and seeing that it was about to get a full release was great too.  I did not take part in the beta though. I dared to say I wanted to wait for the official release. Damn, I was brave enough to ignore all spoilers, the Reddit and the whole Cube World community so I could get the best experience on release as possible.  Sadly, I was disappointed. I told my friends to purchase the game so we could play multiplayer and that it would be an amazing experience, because the Alpha was great. But we've gone through a bad optimisation issue, Syncing was a pain, and the land generation (should we speak about generation at all actually?) took more than 3 minutes so we could move forward. A ping of ~5000ms was common.  With this, we quit multiplayer. Quite a disappointing outcome. All I saw was an RPG Roguelike becoming... Just a Roguelike. But not that, let me go for some things that I managed to see while playing Singleplayer:  - What first picked my mind when watching the game trailer was the lack of an XP bar. I first thought ""Yeah, that's fine, they probably just hid it somewhere"". Nothing more wrong. When I launched the game, I noticed that experience has gone COMPLETELY, while replacing it with some ""artifacts"". What's more, you'd expect them to incease your stats, but in fact those are some visual, exploration-related bonuses, that are so small you would not even notice.  - Region item lock. Seriously? This game in Alpha used to be about exploration, why is it supposed to punish us, the players, for wanting to explore? In the end I found out that my gameplay stopped at the first region I ended up in, and stuck there with all the equipment. Apparently there are some ""+"" items, that are allowed to be used in surrounding regions, but yet they're extremely rare (~1/50 chance) and not entirely worth the grind.  - Item rarity going from literal rarity to Tierness. You begin from Tier white, while beating stronger enemies and working through these tiers up to the highest, yellow level, defeating the original purpose of RPG and grinding in general.  - The skill tree being removed completely.  - The Hang Glider becoming even more useless now that you cannot increase it's speed like you did in Alpha with skills. Not to mention the terribly high stamina consumption.  - The Water Mage and Warrior are even more broken as ever.  - The Mage's hover literally replaces Climbing.  - The enemy AI is completely braindead at times, especially the bigger enemies, not knowing what to do in front of a single, breakable block.  - Progression tied to either RNG or cheesing abilities, usually the second one though, by abusing the aforementioned braindead AI and the surroundings.  - Some bugs that renders the gameplay kind of... Weird.  - The dev had a literal *week* to collect the Beta testers' opinions. What did we, the actual buyers actually get? As far as I'm aware, the exact same game. I'd love to see an actual delay in the release, if I were to get a more complete product that would actually get listened to the players' opinions and feedback.  - Additionally, most of the things Wollay posted on Twitter as teases for the game were not added in the game at all.  That's just a part of what I noticed so far. Wollay, you deceived us all, Alpha players. We were expecting a great update, with new content, with things that would make our gameplay actually engaging and interesting. The Alpha made us expect a better Alpha, but we actually got another game at all. I'm very disappointed to say, that until most of the issues mentioned above are fixed, I may stick to the original, Alpha version.  I do not mean any hate towards Wollay and his work. He did his best to give us the best Cube World experience possible, but I do not understand his way of handling this proces. I am sadly anxious about the future of this game, as no word of his took place after release. Either he just published and panicked due to the negativity or ran away with the money. Either way, we're dealing with an unprofessional dev, and I hope for the best.   Tl;dr A game that did not live up to its expectations, and a dev not having any contact with it's players.

The voxel-based world, the exploration, and the RPG mechanics all seemed like they were building up to something great. But when the full release finally arrived, it just didn’t live up to expectations.  A lot of the mechanics that made the early version enjoyable were completely changed or removed, and the progression system felt more frustrating than rewarding. Instead of leveling up and growing stronger over time, everything resets whenever you enter a new region, making long-term character development feel pointless.  The world itself is still visually charming, and the movement and combat can be fun for a while, but the game lacks the depth needed to keep players invested. It’s a real shame because the foundation was there for something amazing. Instead, Cube World feels more like a hollow version of what could have been.  If you loved the alpha, you might find some enjoyment here, but be prepared for a very different experience. Otherwise, it’s hard to recommend, especially when so many other open-world RPGs do it better."

This game had infinite potential and the game was abandoned twice because the creator couldn't handle criticism.

I don't have hope for this game coming back.

55451452,english,1,1128000,"For the longest time I have been searching for a casual game that I would be able to lean back and play with my friends. From Garry's Mod to Counter-strike, this game fills the void that no other game could. A lot of people are hating on the game because they've waited 6 years for it, and expected something totally different than what they wanted. They expected a masterpiece. Their masterpiece. This game won't fit everyone. It isn't easy. It takes time. People wanted this game to be so many things, and it wasn't what they expected because the game had changed from alpha to now. From a muddle mess to this amazing game. A game meant to bring people together, to fight challenging mobs, get loot, and explore the endless world. This game may not be what everyone wanted, but it is amazing nonetheless. All the people crying about it through their steam reviews are to idealistic to stray from what they WANTED the game to be. Cube World is not perfect, but it is a far cry from a bad game. If you give it time and effort, the game will reward you. Playing both solo and with friends, it isn't impossible. I love this game, and I think that if you are looking for a challenging, casual game to play by yourself or with friends, look no further. Go into this game with a clean mindset. It is a new game, it is not the alpha version from 6+ years ago."
90752168,english,0,1128000,The game is sadly unlike the alpha in pretty much every way. I hope we will get updates to fix this but for now I highly recommend modding the game to enhance the gameplay
55467589,english,1,1128000,"This game is amazing! Now take everything I say with a grain of salt saying as I never played the alpha because I couldn’t get it before it got taken down.  This game is great, but has its downsides. Pros: The game itself looks amazing The soundtrack is lovely The different classes and subclasses means everyone has something for them (for instance Scout and Beserker for me) The way enemies spawn seems better than what the alpha had (I believe the alpha was you spawned at 0 x 0 z and the further you went from 0, 0 the harder the enemies got, versus now regions have all different types of monsters just hanging about and different quests have different levels of monsters) And a whole lot more I could talk about  Cons:  The game has no tutorials, making learning what to do at the start a bit of a challenge if you didn’t play the alpha Items and armor are region locked (excluding artifacts and equipment+) which makes the game less “get good items and blitz the game” and more or less a restart every region.  The region system needs some improvement, the idea itself is good but the execution isn’t too hot, maybe if it were countries that took up the space of like 4 to 6 regions depending on how powerful the country is it would be better  Overall, I still enjoy the game, but there are definitely some things that could be improved, I feel confined to one region until I get good items in that region, but this game applies to a certain type of people and I don’t think it deserves the hate it’s getting, it’s not a bad game it could just use some improvement"
177696319,english,0,1128000,In the alpha it was better than now. the game now not the best with mods it will be playable but its not better than the alpha version. i hope there will be an update or a fix and it will the best again. i miss the alpha.
84324488,english,0,1128000,"The released version of the game is awful. I played the game back in 2013 before it was removed from Picroma's website and had high hopes for the full release. Wollay's bizarre strategy of removing the game from stores for almost a decade was a terrible one. He worked on the game sure, but with no player feedback. It's a game designed for him and him alone. The game is visually stunning that's for sure. That's about all it has going for it in it's current state.  The progression system is awful. Earning XP, leveling up, as well as the Skill Point system were all pruned from the game. The current progression system has you grinding gear like am ARPG, with the caviot of that gear being literally useless outside of the zone it is acquired in. I think this has an interesting Philosophy behind it, but when the game is focused around exploration and finding new zones, it feels terrible. You can spend a dozen hours grinding out the perfect set with just the stats you want, but if cross an invisible boundary you might as well have nothing equipped. This makes the game feel pointless. There is no point in killing ANYTHING in the open world. Enemies do not give XP, rarely ever drop items, and the items they do drop are low quality. So you spend most of the game just avoiding everything. The world feels hollow. The only way to get gear is by going to towns, talking to NPCs until they give you a map location to clear. The skill point system in the Alpha was atleast interesting as you could tailor your character towards a specific build, whereas in the full version of the game, the only improvements you can make to your character are how hard and fast you can auto attack.  Another thing of note is the difficulty of the game. There is no tutorial in game and very limited UI. The default UI has your only ability cooldown tucked into the bottom left corner of the screen, when your health, MP, and your focus are all going to be towards the center. You spawn in the wild right after making your character which is pretty flush and seamless, but if you're a new player, you'll quickly come to realize you don't know what to do. Again, this gives me the impression this is just Wollay's personal game that no one else is supposed to enjoy, let alone play. Any friend I've had try the game has quit within two hours of playing it due to the terrible new player experience. The enemy AI is terribly overpowered. Ranged and magic using enemies literally cannot miss so combat revolves around doing more damage to them before they kill you. The final nail in the coffin for me was the boomerang enemies. When they throw their boomerang, it has aggressive tracking and hardly ever misses, even with immunity frames while rolling. If and when it connects it doesn't return but instead glues onto your character doing constant damage for around 5 seconds. It only takes 2 boomerang throws to kill a newly created character. If your character is a boomerang user, it functions much differently to the point where you question if your boomerang is just cosmetic. Magic uses suffer a similar issue when they cast a tornado spell it moves along with the character they're targeting causing it to never miss, whereas when your character can cast tornado spells if you move your mouse even slightly the entire spell cancels. Somehow Wollay made the enemy AI worse to the point of being irredeemable.  It's really sad that the limited Alpha version of the game feels like it's had much more work and love put into it than the full release version with almost a decade to get the vision down. I hope Wollay reads some feedback for once and gets this game on track. It has a lot going for it. It's gorgeous and the core RPG concepts themselves have potential. It's like watching your crush get a train ran on her. Like why is she even at this party in the first place, she was such a good girl and could be with such a good guy but instead she's getting railed in exchange for xanax and alcohol."
166081782,english,0,1128000,Although I used mods to improve the experience it wasn't enough to save it. I highly recommend anyone to avoid touching this and go play Trove or Valoren instead.
121965642,english,1,1128000,"Ive always loved this game, Over the years i've showed people this game because its literal fun groups or even just to solo play and run wild. Mechanics from the early days i do miss but the game now is still very solid. I hope for the game to come back alive with more updates soon maybe even steam deck availability. Ive got plenty of new ideas for the game if youd be interested for updates Picroma. To anyone else reading ignore the bad reviews and give the game a try i promise its worth it."
114266002,english,0,1128000,The developer decided to put the game on steam and then never do anything with it. He took a bunch of peoples money and never updated the game. Dont buy it.
84122310,english,1,1128000,"The game is tolerable after you mod it. And even then it's a little questionable. Cute aesthetic.  I hope the mods fix the ridiculously HP'd enemies, terrible combat style, the weapon limitation per specialization, and the laser beam attacks that you can't dodge. An enemy shouldn't have 16k HP .____. Idk why that is a thing.   Mod's seem to region lock and help in enemy scaling but even then I seem to frequently get my shit rocked by a snail if i step two feet outside of the village.  The quests and aesthetic is great, I just wish it was more scaled/fair so that we aren't constantly dying."
176631585,english,1,1128000,"This game is a pretty decent game. The game definitely took a wrong turn whilst in development and it shouldve stayed more  closer to the alpha. The game is probably not worth 20 dollars but its still an extremely fun game if you have the dedication to play it. There are some huge flaws with the game that cause people to not buy it. 1. All players are on the same server with different regions and biomes, the problem with this is that players can spawn in a biome with insanely strong enemies and be very stuck. 2. All your equipment and gear downgrades to practically shit once you leave the region it was found in. 3. the leveling system is terrible consisting of collecting ""artifacts"" which barely increase any of your stats such as +3% climbing speed. Now for the upsides. 1. The graphics are amazing and the art and design is great. 2. the gear system i personally think is more improved than the alpha version as now its a star system instead of +1 2 3 etc. 3. Your given a wide verity of weapons to chose from 3 for each class each with its own attack speed, right click attack, and some of them you can dual wield. In short, Cube World steam version had almost achieved a perfect game but it strayed too far from the alpha, if you have a spare 20 dollars spare and looking for a grindy game, this is the game for you. (or if you want free just search up on google for alpha)"
175409709,english,0,1128000,"Really good concept but unfortunatly i cant recomend this as it is just a lvl 1 grinding simulator for every new area you go into. you dont ever feel like you get genuinly powerful and the few items that can scale across zones, + items, are random drops with no consistent way to get them ie. crafting questing etc. over all cool game idea but poorly executed and from reading some of the other reviews you may have seen that the prealpha was pretty fun and a good experience but this is just disapointing at the current state of it and im 90% sure they aren't updating it anymore, truely sad, not worth the $25 NZD."
178964740,english,1,1128000,"I played this game in the Alpha version a pretty long tome ago, so I have nostalgic memories of Cube World. I played it recently and bought the steam version and here's what I have to say about Cube World in general:  I truly believe this game likely would have been a titan in the ""block game"" category if the creator didn't take a hard left turn when updating it past alpha to put on steam. Alpha world generation is peak world generation, the game was simple and had an addictive gameplay loop. Improving skill trees, adding human companions, improving village generation (or making a quest based generation) could have been implemented to make the game perfect.  Cube World Steam Version changes the main gameplay loop entirely. crafting materials are rarer and loot drops are better, and there is no level restriction on equipment. The new gameplay loop is kill bosses, loot better gear, kill more bosses. The objective of Steam Version is to collect ""Artifacts"" around the biomes which give random improvements to abilities. Leaving a biome removes all the items collected and ""resets"" your character. This is a literal gameplay ""Loop."" Once you complete the first area, you have to do the exact same thing again from the bottom. Dying in steam version also sucks. Even with gear equal to the boss, you are still extremely likely to die if you don't cheese the boss. respawn areas are 1-3 entire minutes away from boss locations, so you are stuck holding W and maybe scrolling on your phone for 3 minutes just to die immediately and do it again. This is where I stopped playing Steam Version, fighting the highest level enemy with the highest level equipment and losing multiple times.   The alpha version is a craft/loot combination exploration game. You start out extremely weak, dying to every wild animal. Finding crafting materials and fighting the few enemies you can defeat lets you get better armor and use the very limited skill tree. Killing the bosses scattered around the map provides you with special crafting materials for weapons and a bunch of exp. As you level up, you can craft better gear and equip better gear. That is the gameplay loop of alpha Cube World. Craft and equip gear to kill difficult bosses, level up, craft more gear and fight more bosses. The distance between bosses in alpha is still obscene, but there are respawn points 15 seconds away from every boss, and the areas in between are filled out better with ore, crafting materials, and radiant bosses.  I really wish this game was moddable. Sadly, it seems that the developer made a lot of the code and programs very unfriendly to modders. The 4-5 mods for this game are not true scripted mods, but are instead mods that change 1 or 2 numbers of a variable.  Heres how I suggest enjoying cube world:  1. Buy the steam version and play it for a few hours. Don't hurt the developer because you don't like how they manage their game, they still deserve support for creating the game you are playing.   2. Look for the alpha version download online. Download that version and play it for a few hours as well. The game is very hard in the start because everything can kill you, so don't get discouraged right off the bat. There is little skill mechanics in the game, enemies auto lock attacks, have super far reach and attack faster than you can dodge. You are required to get better equipment to defeat enemies."
90147833,english,0,1128000,"Like many others, I played the alpha version and loved it. I achieved thousands of levels because of it and it stayed interesting  because of it's uniqueness of graphics and gameplay. I understand that the full release had to live up to the success of the Alpha but it tried too hard to be unique that it ultimately failed. The mechanic where different regions have a ""lock"" on your gear is, in my opinion, stupid. I can spend hours grinding for good gear in one area, but when I decide to explore this vast world some more, the game punishes you by locking your items. This game that promotes exploration with its vast, open world and many enemies also contradicts itself by essentially taking away all the gear you worked hard for at first. You can for sure fix these problems with mods, but players shouldn't have to fix a games problems themselves. I bought this game when it first came out on steam however so I didn't have much options when it came to mods. In short, buy the game if you don't care about downloading a few mods; normal vanilla gameplay doesn't do it for me though."

They had a level-up system in their first release of the game some years ago which was a really nice feature and you got a feeling of progression which you don't get in this game at it's state.   If they were to add a level-up system and not a reset in progress upon entering other biomes, i'd play this again."
70701070,english,0,1128000,"Very, very saddened by what has happened to this game. I started playing Cube World back in late 2016 or early 2017. I absolutely adored it. I was, of course, playing the alpha build of the game,. Hundreds of hours of gameplay and I was still finding tings completely new to me. I remember freaking out the first time I ever found a portal. I was mind blown. I was amazed. I had absolutely fallen for this game. It became a ritual of mine to search online forums and social media for any trace of the game, and its future updates.   This is one of my all time favorite games. But not like this. Not in this state. This ""completed"" Cube World is nothing at all like what I spent countless hours on. I do NOT recommend this version of Cube World. The only reason I purchased and kept the game was to try to pay Wollay back for the enjoyment I received from the alpha build. Seeing this game in the state it is now leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, and I will forever be heartbroken for what Wollay has done do his beaitufl creation.  All that being said, if anyone wants the alpha build of the game, I am more than willing to share with you on Google Drive. I would recommend Alpha 1000x before this full release. Since the game is ""completed"" now, and the alpha version is lost to time, the only way to receive it is to either pirate it or have it shared. If anyone wants to try the alpha version, email me at the following:  AEROGON123@GMAIL.COM"

No Level up system, region lock items, no enemy level scaling, no skill tree. They completely killed the awesome progression the game had and the feeling to explore the world. I would like to know from the dev if he really thought that region locking items would be a good move and everyone would like it. This game completely sucks at its current state, you don't even have a motivation to move to another region and explore the map. It's completely dumb the way items and equipment work now. I played the alpha version till lvl 365 and now I can't even play one hour straight without ragin the entire system. Just don't buy it. For you Wolfram, just add mod support and let the community fix your game :)  In the end, I just wanted to play the old Cube World again..."

89728595,english,0,1128000,"[For anyone who played Alpha/Beta]. Review given on 4-4-2021. In short: Do not recommend to buy this game BEFORE 2022 as some people claim the developer is still working on this game(If that even is true?).  My review: Remember the skill tree? GONE Remember the proper item crafting? GONE Remember the farming system where you had to find certain characters to get items? GONE  I [b]LOVED[/b] the Alpha and beta. If you see the game and are wishing to still try it out. Don't, its a different game now. Whats new: - No leveling/skill tree, just plain skill (exept for the first hour since EVERYTHING can kill you untill you find at minimum 1 legendary item) - Items are just farming a region. Take a biome of minecraft in mind and take that size, thats ur play size. If you get a FULL legendary set, it's [b]LITERALLY[/b] useless, since everything that is legendary in THAT specific region is BASIC in another region/biome. Once you find 1 or 2 legendary items, you can kill anything so it's creating boring fights. This means in EVERY biome, you must basically START OVER (Stats change the moment u enter the biome or go back). This is basically a run, farm and then do it over again, there is NO progress to be done if you are finished with farming items.   As much as i wanted to feel the nostalgia and was thinking: ""It can't be THAT bad, it's probably still a fun game"". Believe the other people. Oh, and they removed the nice dungeons that went down in the ground.  Feel sad that i figured out the game is more dead then i imagined.. :("

The region locking mechanic and the slow start (hour or two of just running around, hoping you can find a piece of equipment that allows you to actually do something), make the game excruciatingly boring. Then, after you swap regions, you have to do it all again. It's tedious, boring, and insanely grindy. Not to mention, the long term rewards you get are useless, since the stuff it goes towards gets taken away from you each region anyways.  Modders are the only hope this game has, as the developers have gone ghost again, and haven't given any updates since launch."

55889930,english,0,1128000,"Sorry Wollay, I tried.   I tried so damn hard to make something positive out of this game for 24 hours of gameplay here, and i bet my left buttcheek 100+ on the alpha, and failed.   Cube world, created by a German company Picroma, was a spin-off to Minecraft back in 2011-2012 when cube games where the stuff, and open world random-gen sandboxes thrived both singleplayer-wise and multiplayer-wise.  After about 2 months of sales of the alpha on Picroma's website, the site has been overloaded by a supposed DDoS attack on the store, making the game unpurchasable and traumatising one of the developers to hide for 6 years with only two windows on the outside world: Their Twitter accounts.  For six years, every month or so, Wolay or Pixxie were to drop in a sneak peek of what is to come to the game, the Harps, new enemies, new dungeons or quest systems, many things! How hyped we have been since we got each piece of the puzzle!  Wollay and Pixxie pretty much has created a cult out of the fanbase, waiting for their messiah to give them a lesson in their religion. And as every cult, not every one was satisfied with a prayer or a teaching... we had extremists.  People literally have sent the guy hate mails, threats, hate comments, sadly not every fan was over 15 at the time... Me neither lol, But i'd never send something  like that to a talented guy.  Critique sent to Wollay did not have much response, but was enough to create an unofficial discord, were people rallied to help the guy out and send him some more deserved motivation by sending a smiley or some stuff...   off to the game now:  Six years since then has passed, and I ahve been greeted by a GIGANTIC steam advert that CUBEWORLD is COMING OUT. THIS SEPTEMBER. OH. MY. GOD.  2012 kiddo has been revived in my soul, and went to an override.  Cubeworld on an updated version of the engine, with new stuff, new adventures... MUSIC (ThANK GOD! This game was a mute back then!) and an ability to play with friends via steam!  Then you input your hard-earned (or hard saved) bucks on the title, you downlaod it... (200MB! HAH) And run it! You are greeted by a blue fog of war, the classic in that universe, the engine after 6 years still can't comprehend rendering....  Okay, not bad! you are in the game, made yourself the water mage (Like the ol'school days) Aaaand you get greeted by the unknown.  Mechanics have changed.  -there is no skills anymore, everything is unlocked since the beginning. -money is different, each enemy drops a coin or two, no matter what tier. -there is no XP anymore, just the wierd artifacts with permanent movement buffs (which are utterly useless, I don't want +1% swim speed) villages feel uglier than before, instead of nice, pastel coloured cities we have villages now, soviet-russia grade.   and here goes the fun part...  *cricket noises*  Oh yeah. THERE AINT ANY!  You don't really progress your character, except the artifact unlocks, which are hidden inside a top-tier dungeon in every region.  Oh. Yeah. Remeber that sword you have dropped on the way? or the boat you havefound after 20 minutes of walking and 30 minutes of respawning back in the latest respawn point?   ITS GONE AFTER YOU CROSS THE BORDER OF THE REGION!  Yep. Tools disappear, you in two oceans regions? Nuh uh, magic border-patrol locks your boat back in the region it came from!  TL;DR: game has lost it's golden nuggets, and decided to paint droplets of crap with a golden spraypaint. And Wollay?  He's out. And as much as I am sad,  I hope he won't come back to CubeWorld. Not even with an update.  You broke too much my man."

92080681,english,1,1128000,"TLDR: Don't play if you're a beta user - it's not going to fill the gap in your heart. If you have no prior experience with Cube World, give it a shot.  Okay, so first of all something needs to be clarified. Most of the negative reviews are from people who played the game back in the early alpha/beta stages and miss the mechanics designed back then.   The game is fairly good, my wife and I had a great time playing it together, albeit somewhat simpler in its current form than those complaining desire. I would encourage you to come to it with an open mind, and remember that it is only for $20.   Pros: -The game feels great to explore in, similar to minecraft. The world is breathtakingly beautiful even though it's simple voxels.  -The pets are cute and finding them and giving them the right food feels great.  -Enemies are challenging in each section until you get decent gear, and you have to re-gear in each zone. (This becomes monotonous after more than 2 zones.) -Co-op. -Certain quests feel rewarding (such as saving a village which is petrified.)  Cons: -Re-gearing in new zones can be frustrating. -20 hours or less, even with the massive world. -Most quests begin to feel like repeats, and lack decent rewards. -Entering a new area forces you to find new lassos/gliders/flutes etc. Losing these items reminds you how crucial they are and can be irritating.  There are four classes, each with their own weapons/style. I recommend water mage for newbies - healing is very helpful early on. (You change your subclass in a village.)   It's certainly not a bad game, especially for the price."

So many other solo indie devs that communicate with their fans and add updates. Shame Woolay isn't one of them."

I'm looking forward to seeing what he has in store for us. Despite my harsh criticism I do enjoy Cube World and want both it and Wollay to succeed. I will post a new review once this next major update is out. Fingers crossed and good luck Wollay.  Even with a copious amount of mods to fix some of the biggest issues, this is one of the biggest disappointments I have ever purchased and experienced. Wollay dropped the ball hard and the only person he can blame is himself. Turning his back on the community doomed this game. Several straight up boneheaded decisions like region locking items and horrible excuses for progression sucked all the fun out of this simple but charming game. If you are at all interested in this game, go play the alpha from 2013. It is much more fun and rewarding than this boring and frustrating experience. Hopefully Wollay will eventually fix and atone for his mistake and take responsibility. He needs to take the feedback and feelings of the community seriously instead of running away with his tail between his legs again."

60849680,english,0,1128000,"After 6 years of being away from the scene the mad lad himself comes back with a game with less content then the alpha, grabs the money out of our hyped up hands and vanishes again. If you really want this game go for it, but don't buy it at normal price ( since its clearly overpriced) and 1st check when the last update was made, if it hasn't been touched  since released chances are it wont be touched for another 6 years ( time is heavily dependent on how long the money he made lasts)."
144198815,english,0,1128000,"Before this game came to Steam, and before the major update that took the developers 20 years to release, this game was worth every penny. Sure, it had it glitches and bugs, but it was a game in-development. Now, I believe that saying this game is still under development is a tragic understatement. Before the update, you didn't have to worry about your weapons and armor no longer being effective because you went to a new area on the map. While fighting was challenging, it was not impossible, and you could actually kill stuff. Remember when you would kill something and get experience for it? For some reason, that was taken out, eliminating one of the biggest ways to level up. Now, the only way you can level up is accepting quests that will take you to incredibly difficult dungeons that are so far up the leveling scale, you'd have to be hopelessly addicted to this game just to attempt to be high enough level to take those dungeons on. The mages are still OP as hell, you can no longer buy the gliders and boats from the shops, you now have to go and FIND them. Characters you create are now tied to their own worlds, so you can no longer create your own worlds. Finding gear for your character's class is hopelessly rare, whereas before the update you could just find a landmark, drop the gear you couldn't use, hop onto another character that could use that gear, go to that landmark, and give that character that gear. Not anymore. There isn't even a mailing system where you could send stuff to another character of yours.  Don't waste your money on a game that only got worse after a major update the devs spent too long to release. This game was amazing once, now it's just a hopeless grind with OP enemies, and crappy leveling. How I wish there was a pre-update version of this game. But, just like with everything else we were hoping to see in the new update: it'll never happen."
55469836,english,0,1128000,"If you're thinking of buying this because of seeing videos of Alpha gameplay, don't, it's entirely different and almost nothing like the Alpha. It's essentially just running around trying to figure out what to do for 2 hours, before finally realizing you need to do quests to do anything at all, realizing you need to cheese every boss or have extremely over the top gear from cheesing a high level enemy, and then losing everything you've gained the moment you travel too far. Just save your money until it's fixed, which it most likely wont be."
55417625,english,0,1128000,"man i want to like this game so bad.... after finishing the first zone, I was having a blast. Then I left that zone. Everything gone except for a useless ""artifact"" that only made my lamp shine a little brighter.  I'm sorry but the alpha had more content then the game does right now. Before there was much more to do with an exp system (not to mention the oceans are literally EMPTY husks. Before there were fish, now there's seemingly NOTHING in there)  Its depressing what happened to this game. I honestly hope it's an experimental release or something along those lines. All those years just to have my expectations(which honestly if he just added some needed changes to the old game, I would have been fine with) completely shattered. I know this sounds like a self centered review but this is just how I feel about it. It's not what I played a couple years ago. :/  Not to mention, every zone your practically doing the same thing over and over, just with a different name and zone look. No variety."

Please fix this burning pile of a game."
109349492,english,1,1128000,"On It's own the game is a shadow of it's former alpha. But with mods slightly tweaking the games core, it can turn into an adventure that no other game can give you. There's plenty of open world space, fun fights, awesome loot. Overall a very good experience."
118979516,english,1,1128000,"I will recommend with one large asterisk: play with mods. I did try it without mods first and knew beforehand what I was getting into because I did some research on the game. I never played the alpha but it seems most preferred the game in that state. Without mods there is no leveling and you are more or less restricted to a zone because of the way gear works. Yes, you can explore to your heart's content, however it is nearly fruitless because you can explore and get your gear worked up pretty nicely in zone X only for it to become useless in any other one.  The mods I have used (I found them posted in the discuss section) reintroduced leveling and a host of other things that were apparently supposed to be in the finished game. Gear is still lightly tied to zones and will suffer a downgrade when entering a new area but it doesn't become completely useless.  It is a fun game but I suspect if you aren't very interested in modding your games you will likely become bored because of stark limitations of gameplay. It is also pretty tough and you will probably have to grind out very weak mobs to get at least a couple levels before being able to do much like craft some armor and a better weapon. I haven't been using guides or anything but as a mage I found I can cheese quite a bit by staying on tree tops and using magic. Doesn't work 100% of the time as some enemy projectiles (and your own magic) can break foliage and leave you tumbling to the ground if you aren't careful. You can almost fly (better than using a Hang Glider you find) by using your float ability: jump, hit float, then rapidly tap it as you sail in a direction you want. It keeps you fairly horizontal in the direction you wish to go.  Been having some fun with it even though it really does require some mods to get longevity out of it."
191086850,english,1,1128000,"Cube World is a decent game in its current state, but man it could have been so much more. I remember playing the alpha years ago and being super hyped for a full release. The current state of the game with its zone locking shenanigans makes it fun for the first handful of hours, but when you begin going to new zones and have your good gear suddenly become worthless it kinda loses steam. I really wish Wollay stuck around through all the backlash and really polished this game up to perfection À la No Man's Sky. The only other game that comes close to Cube World's style is Trove, but Trove is an MMO and doesn't really play the same. I wish steam had a option for leaving a mixed review for games like this."

121553204,english,0,1128000,"Abandoned Game. A shame really.  Dev took the money and ran, which is really sad since this clearly had potential. Its not like its a bad game, but people waited 6 Years for this after the Alpha released 2013, only to get a game that is arguably less finished than before somehow.   They completely scrapped the well liked Progression System from the Alpha of the Game. Instead we now have essentially region locked gear and levels. When you leave the Area you got your gear from, it downgrades it to abyssmal stats, making it unusable. As you can guess, this is a very... questionable feature in a Game with infinite world generation.   A lot of the stuff the Dev of this game promised and teased is simply not in the game.  Im talking big cities, certain kinds of dungeons, skilltrees etc.  You know, the good stuff people actually wanted.  Furthermore, you`ll need a playlist. Since the music in this game, while not sounding bad at first, starts giving you a headache after around ~30mins. Every song sounds the same with slight changes or one different instument. It just gets on your nerves after a while.  If you plan on playing this in Multiplayer, i have bad news for you.  It simply doesnt work. Desyncs, random disconnects, people not showing up despite being online, friends not being able to join for no reason etc.  Big servers with 100+ people like back in the Alpha are not a thing anymore. Gone are the days of 30 People teaming up to kill a +4 Legendary monster.   As you can guess from this review, i am really dissapointed.  Especially since this could have been amazing if the Dev just expanded on the already successfull Alpha.   This is a perfect example of: ""If it aint broke, dont fix it."" Overall: 2/10  Rather play the unfinished Alpha."
64326307,english,0,1128000,"I enjoy my time playing Cube World. I think for the first couple hours you have a character and you are learning, or relearning the game, is a real treat, but after you've done your first region it just goes downhill from there. I feel like I'm speed-running the next couple regions. I ask myself ""why am I subjecting myself to this boredom and displeasure?"" so I stop playing. But somehow it seems the I'm always drawn back. I think if you were there for the hype of the game; you should buy it just to see what it really is lie for yourself, but if you are totally new to the game; don't buy it.

This game suffered at his hands the way minecraft did with Notch; an overly controlling entrepreneur who wants to produce THEIR vision. There are new systems that drain the fun from the game. The cool generated castles and dungeons are gone. NPC's spout one of half a dozen madlib phrases. ""I'm going to be the greatest <class> in the land!"" Good for you, you wafer thin attempt at content!  Lets talk about the elephant in the room: per-land gear. This has to be one of the least well thought out ways to artificially stretch the content out. Gear crafting allows you to add a voxel to your weapon, but the crafting has all the depth of a teaspoon.  This should be my favorite game ever. As a minecraft, zelda and d&d player this is like the venn diagram intersection! The formula is gold, as proven by the alpha! But the poor choices in the games design are astoundingly dumb, and turn this into a waste of money.

Its worth a good 10-15 hours of fun playtime (would be much longer without region locking), and I think at a discount this game is worth buying.

55402227,english,1,1128000,"Hey, after 6 years of silent, we actually get to play Cube World. And I'll be honest. I enjoyed it. Even though I recommended Cube World, I'm not saying this game didn't have a flaw, it's a big one as well. But let go over the good thing I found first. + The environment is great. Everything look very lively and colorful, making exploring alone fun and enjoyable. + The game greatly present exploring. The more you explore the stronger you become, but that doesn't mean you would become overpower, as you explore more zone, the more adaptive the game become. As you can't use the same gear in another zone (Not including Plus Gear of course) you need to explore more if you want to get stronger, which allow you to explore even more terrain. + The artifact is very interesting, to actually level up, you need to explore. Gathering as much information as possible to locate the artifact. The artifact as a concept act more like a treasure hunt rather than a progression.  Now that we're done with the pros, now for the flaws. - The game is very unbalance. When you start the game, you will die a lot, as most monster actually one shot you if you get too close, and fighting against range enemy at first feel like hell, especially mages as their move are strong as hell. If you challenge a strong enemy at first. You do not stand a chance. But once you get rarer gear, it only get much more powerful the more you go. Even you yourself is unbalance, some skills is actually hella broken. The example of this is Ranger Scout Subclass Ultimate. The quicksands is so strong as the move slow the enemy, let them take more damage, and have hilariously low cooldown of 40 seconds, and the cooldown actually start when you activate the ability, not when it disappear. You can actually beat a level 5 melee boss with the starter gear by abusing this skill. And that just cheating. - The game is lacking motivation, once you get stronger gear, you become too powerful in that zone, but once you change area, your gear immediately become useless, being weaker than a level 1 gear in that zone. Seeing this, most people get discourage about exploring, and just play in that area until they're bored and stop playing. The artifact, even if it fun to find it, still doesn't have enough impact to make people think exploring is important. - This is the biggest flaws of the game, it's very repetitive. There are difference between repetitive and replayable, and Cube World lean into repetitive rather than replayable. Each time you explore into different area, you are having a different experience, but it's the same, you make a gear, fight something until you get better gear, get the best gear, beat all the dungeons and quest in that area, get information for artifact, then change area. And you do that everytime, and yes, there is something different each time, but the main thing is always the same.  Looking at my review, you may think the game isn't fun. But you need to try it. The game may miss progression and motivation, but the game is enjoyable, everything pros blend in together perfectly and with a little more love and care, this game can clearly be a masterpiece. And hey, maybe this will be another no man sky fiasco, who know?  In Conclusion, This game may not be the best. But you cannot find any experience like it anymore. You may enjoy it or not, but that doesn't stop this game from being fun. I encourage everyone to pick up the game and try it for themselves. If you enjoy it, great! If not, well, leave a review!"

55516502,english,0,1128000,"Basically everything it was good for was removed, and most of the stuff shown during development - not added. This game is a good example of what happens when you don't communicate with the people who follow the development as much, basically making the game alone and not even testing it.

55452432,english,1,1128000,"If you have never played a previous version of Cube World before, please read this review:  The reason the reviews are mixed as of now is because a lot of players who played Cube World in the alpha version are unhappy at the state of the game at release. This is because the level progression system changed since alpha, as well as other game-changing factors. Ultimately, their expectations were high then suddenly dropped.  Now let me review this game as somebody who has never played Cube World prior to my purchase 3 days ago:  This game does have an interesting leveling system - yes. Each region contains at least one artifact that you get through exploring the region, talking to people and obtaining better gear. This artifact gives you a slight upgrade to something. This is your level progression. Most gear doesnt transfer  over to other regions meaning you have to start the grind all over again. To me, this is a lot of fun. I enjoy the unique system this game follows. This system definitely is not for everyone though.   Another aspect of the game I enjoy is the exploration. Exploration is forced, but thats what you would expect from an open world, adventure game. The exploration in this game in my opinion is done so well that I never get bored wandering around. I could do so for hours. The adventure and scenery in this game gives it a truly magical appeal that puts me in a positive mood. Not to mention this game has the best map function I have ever witnessed in a game.   To conclude, this game is a magical experience full of superlative adventure and hours of content. The level system is different, but not difficult to get used to. As off-putting as most reviews for this game are, try not to let that change your viewpoint on the game, since a lot are biased towards a previous version. As somebody playing this game for the first time, I absolutely recommend this game if you are looking for an exciting adventure."

190398560,english,0,1128000,"Game was completely reworked from the previous version disregarding everything it had and left to rot once again, the developer doesn't seem to care much about consumer opinion, disregard this game and go back to the alpha version."

61774691,english,1,1128000,"I need to preface this with the following; unmodded, Cube World is awful. But installing the mods required to fix the progression system is incredibly easy, which results in an infinitely superior experience.  The lack of a proper XP system was a bit of a let down at first, but having experienced the progression at its best, I can safely say I'm fine with it. Early game is hell but once you start accumulating power, shit hits the fan fast. Exploration is entertaining and satisfying, though the whole map being revealed from the start is a puzzling decision. The relic system is cool as well and combos effectively with the various stats your gear can grant, and the payoff for the lore is entertaining. Without region lock and with proper progression scaling as you move further away from where you started, Cube World is everything I'd hoped it would be. These two small changes fix the game in so many ways and the resulting experience is, IMO, a ton of fun.  Now for stuff that applies to the base game. Dungeons are fun to explore, enemy variety is extremely good and solid, and the landscapes are absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. My only complaints is, again, the whole map being revealed; it should reveal itself as you explore more segments of the world.  Make no mistake, the developer goofed hard, but the effort of the community to make it better makes it worth a buy in my honest opinion."
165255405,english,0,1128000,"I've wanted to enjoy this so bad since it launched on steam but it's just so annoyingly bad.  For starters, there is no clear cut leveling system. All of your stats are tied to your gear that you find/craft. There's no experience points and no abilities or talents to work towards unlocking. The latter isn't necessarily bad, but having access to all your class abilities from the start is slightly boring. It's an RPG with no skills to unlock. it feels weird.  The enemy scaling is terrible. You could start a new character, see some bugs in the distance you think you can take on and then be dead 10 seconds after attacking them.   Your gear is region locked. If you enter a new zone you have to re-obtain special equipment (boat, glider, etc.) for that zone and all of your gear gets downgraded. Did you spend a long time obtaining/crafting the best gear you could? Better get ready to do it all over again cause it will be useless if you enter a new region! And because your stats are tied to your gear (since there's no exp based leveling system) you're basically level 1 when you enter a new region!  Traveling becomes kind of annoying after a while. You will either need to find and tame a ride-able pet to speed you up or spend gold on flight paths.  Good luck trying to progress if its night time in game. This game is so unreasonably dark you cannot see anything. Your lantern does not provide enough light. Oh, and there is no brightness setting to crank up to get around this issue. So there's that.  Word gen customization. In the Alpha version of the game you could enter custom seeds for your world generation which was neat. That feature is gone now in this version. There aren't even world slots for you to use. It just assigns a world to your character and that's that.  This game had such potential to be amazing. A lot of people loved the alpha release, but the developer took so many steps in the wrong direction with this.  Don't buy the game. Not worth it unless the dev comes back from the dead to finish it. If you really want to play it though, make sure you mod it. I recommend trying CubeMegaMod. It's one of the few mods that are still compatible with the game."

However I must say I just cannot play it in its current state.  In the 27 minutes I played, my character was chased by red blobs that shot water, a Skull Bull, three giants and a golem. I fought everything I could but just died each time. The game also just....feels no different than the alpha. Hell, the alpha was better and more polished than this is to me. The game feels like you're supposed to fail. The first thing to get; the Glider, was in the middle of a volcano and no matter what I tried I just KEPT dying. Nothing stopped it. I could never get out to it. The animations are unchanged even though there are claims they are polished, and it just feels like a messy game release. We know you needed money back on this investment you made Wollay, but this feels lazy.....  Can I pet dogs? yes. Horses? Yeah. Pigs? Sheep? Cows? YES But can I enjoy myself with any other part of this game at this point? No.  All in all, just wait till it gets updates and patches. Its current state should be listed as a WIP or alpha.

So much promise for nothing in the end"
55856264,english,1,1128000,"Deary me. Here goes. When this game was first released in 2013, together with an unbelievable amount of other blocky voxel games that have been indubitably inspired by the success of Minecraft, I was in my teens. Not having had any means of online payment, I didn't purchase it back then, though I was still moderately hyped from watching some YouTube creators playing it with their mates.   Due to this, I haven't had much in the way of expectations. I didn't know what I was getting, I didn't remember how good it has been. When it was announced that, after six years of development hell, it will be released, I was hyped which is why I got it on Day 1.   First impression... Well, you're not being told anything at all about the mechanics. A player needs to find out everything by themselves, trial and error, due to the lack of a tutorial. Would have been nice to include one.  After having found out about the basics of the game, I encountered the first feature which I immediately disliked. The vast majority of the obtainable items are locked to the region you picked them up in. It would appear that this is a product of the missing progression system. Progression is gathering all items, finishing all mission, completing every dungeon in one region, and start over in the next one. Probably not the best approach. Mages. F*ck mages. They are terribly overpowered. They hard-lock onto your sorry rear and frag you.   After doing some research, I of course found out that there are quite a few features missing from the original, making people rather unhappy, which is understandable. The ""low"" quality of the game is surely a by-product of Wollay's isolation during those six years. The community couldn't give any advice, recommendations, feature requests, etc., of course it isn't exactly what everybody wanted. Those issues can only be sorted out now. We also won't get any updates in the near future, since Wollay has gone MIA, probably dealing with PTSD. I'm certainly worried about him. All the best to Wollay. Concerning the accusations that ""Hur dur dur Wollay has scammed us!""... Are you serious?!?!?! I refuse to believe that this is the sole purpose of this game.  The game needs a few fixes and changes here and there. Some members of the community have made that quite clear, some have been quite toxic while doing that. Not really the best behaviour.  At any rate... I still like this game! It's fun, even if some others have been spoilt by and arguably better version and hence had higher expectations.  [Edit 31-10-19: Minor wording adjustments]"

68029646,english,1,1128000,"I expected to be able to sink as many hours into the game as I did in the Alpha version - unfortunately the region locking has led to my disillusionment with the game and to my choosing to uninstall it after 36 hours.  Simply put, the first two or three regions are fine, fun, fantastic - the discovery elements are great, the combat is solid as the Alpha was, and the pets meant I never felt completely alone despite playing exclusively in singleplayer.  Having gotten ""+ items"" early on, I had no issue with the regions surrounding my initial one, rapidly acquiring the gimmicks that locked content in these new regions (whistle, flute, bell, etc.). However, my enjoyment peaked there due to my losing all progress in the next region, which greatly disheartened me.  I believe there's a mod floating around somewhere (Reddit iirc) that disables the region-lock for reins, gliders, and boats, so I could probably get a bunch more enjoyment out of this game - but I'm in no hurry and I expect I'll revisit it at some point in the future.  With all this said, the base game is still incredibly fun and entertaining - one need only watch some gameplay on YouTube to see how fluid the game is, and in-person one can easily experience all the game has to offer in 2 hours. The main glaring issue remains the region-locking which broke my immersion and ended up making me shun the game, but perhaps others might not be as put off by this as me."
55545463,english,1,1128000,"Wall of text warning, this is getting long!  Honestly, I am having a lot of fun with this game! There is a lot more to it than many would have you believe. And, since I know this is going to be the first question a bunch of you ask, I did play Alpha. And, I like this better.   This is a game that has been designed with two goals in mind, endless adventure and seamless multiplayer, and the systems reflect that. It also seems to reward those who are not in a hurry and spend time gathering crafting ingredients, hunting non-boss mobs, and just generally enjoying the ride. It's not about the destination, if you play it with that mindset you will be very disappointed.  It's a lot of fun to just chill, relax, and adventure, however.  The gear is region-locked, meaning that when you enter a new ""region"" your gear becomes white (drop down to the first tier of gear), and you must find travel gear (boats, hang-gliders, and the like) again. You don't actually lose the old ones, they just don't work for the new region. Your gear also retains it's old properties if you ever want to return to where it's valid again (there is actually a good reason to do this). It even has it's own pages, navigable at the bottom of the inventory screen, to keep it separated from your current region. You may not want to sell your old region gear just yet.  Really, this is not that big a deal to me, and necessary to keep the game from becoming stale. You don't actually completely start over ""at square one"" when the gear resets, you still have all your potions and crafting ingredients, money, pets, and potentially + gear (gear that retains it's bonuses in larger multi-region areas so that it's useful longer). You have more than enough to really make a good start in the new region, and I don't personally find it feels like a whole new character.  Also, NPCs in the new regions still really like my old boots.  What this does do, however, is makes the content in this new region valid. There was this problem that I, and others, found in the Cube World Alpha progression system (similar issues happen in most progression systems if you try to extend them very far), and that was eventually (I found it didn't take all that long) your gear and levels made the game ridiculously easy, and most people just flew around on their hang-gliders looking for dungeons. There were only two main valid locations at that point. Dungeons and towns. This system is in response to issues like that, and has actually been pretty well thought out.  It does feel like a little bit of a let-down when my gear turns white and I am back to killing yard-trash for a while. It would be like this in many other ""normal"" progression systems, too, if you consider that you are now level 15 in a 15-25 region. This is perhaps harder to bear as you have a visible representation in gear color that does feel like you lost something. Still, I know to expect that, and I get the reason.  As mentioned before, + gear exists. This is gear that retains it's qualities in a larger multi-region area (I have seen the dev refer to them as ""Kingdoms"" once, but really don't know much more about them, or how they are defined, it's not obvious in-game). + gear is fairly rare, but after you have completed a region (found all the artifacts) it becomes more common. This is why I say it's a good idea to potentially return to regions you have already completed.  The world is huge. If I understand it right, it is essentially procedurally generated, but we all have the same seed to keep it multiplayer friendly. You start ""somewhere"" in this world and set out from there. It's not, however, like an MMO where you see others and their actions effect your own world. Multiplayer works through the Steam friend system, and you can join your friends in distant regions with free rides from the flight masters.  It is important to understand the difficulty system, and that it matters. There are several colored tiers of gear: white, green, blue, purple, gold. This is probably pretty familiar to many folks from other games. When starting out don't try to take down colored mobs. The quests also are (mostly) colored accordingly (the dungeons seem to register as white, but are not). Your character's current gear is rated similarly, with separate Armor and Weapon ratings. These seem to be pretty accurate indicators of what you can expect to handle, though be mindful of boss mobs. Boss mobs can be scary.  Pay attention to your surroundings. Stronger mobs can be found near weaker ones, but you can usually see them before you wander into them if you are mindful. I was already several hours in before I was killed by something powerful that caught me off-guard, and it seldom happens still.  I find the world is actually much more full than Alpha, though I am sure many would disagree with me. There are many little adventure sites in the wild, ones with mini-bosses and interesting challenges. One theme that seems pretty common is freeing merchant gnomes from things like undead, witches, and necromancers. I may have lucked out in my first region because I have a pile of stuff there, including a couple of Steel Empire airship invasions, and have seen other regions that don't seem nearly that full. Perhaps this is where some of the complaints come from.  Again, if you are the kind of player who likes to crash through content, you probably will want to pass this one by. The quests and challenges can require a bit of footwork to find, talking to villagers, completing other things first, things like that. But, if you are like me, and really like to just get immersed in the world it can be pretty fun. Personally I don't like having everything handed to me on a silver-platter in a nice clean quest-hub or breadcrumb trail. But, I also played EverQuest when it was new and really enjoyed that, as well. I find this easier.  There is no skill tree anymore, and while I don't actually like this, I do understand why the dev would have wanted to remove it. The idea is, I think, that any player can hang with any other player in any region, and this facilitates that goal. It still would have been nice to have potentially a horizontal skill tree, meaning you have access to new abilities, though new abilities that are reasonably balanced with the rest.  This is not to say all mages play the same, or anything like. Each class has a couple of specializations that offer different sets of abilities, and each weapon-type adds more variance to that. Off the top of my head I would say there are 6 ways to play that mage.  The game begins with the whole map revealed, though no details such as town names or quest area names filled in, these you can learn from NPCs or by going there yourself. There are mixed opinions on this since you can spend time inspecting the map to try locate towns and things. I don't mind it, and understand that it is facilitating the multiplayer aspect, as well as the fact you can just say ""I want to go explore a savannah today, let me check my map and catch a flight there.""  Is it a perfect game? No. Is it for everyone? No.  However, if the gameplay I described sounds appealing, and the region locking does not sound like such a harsh thing, it might well be worth trying out. I, and many others, actually like it quite a bit. The reviews on here are a bit skewed as most folks who do like it are scared to review due to the way certain elements in the community react to anything that does not agree with their opinions.  Not saying all the negative opinions are wrong, there are valid arguments, especially giving differing preferred playstyles, and I do agree with some of the criticisms out there. But, there are also people throwing out things like ""It's a scam"", ""The dev is (inset all sorts of nasty things)"", or various other toxic comments. I have also seen several reviews from people that, in my opinion, have not put enough time in to really have a firm grasp of what actually is here."
116164912,english,1,1128000,"Even if some features from the alpha never made it into the release, i still greatly enjoy cube world for what it is, without comparing it to the alpha. I am in favour of the region locking as i'm sure if you kept the best stuff you would just blow through regions with the only challenge coming from the first one. And with the key items, depending on the order you got them you have to traverse the land differently which always keeps things from being the same. Along with the different biomes, structures and dungeons my expectations are always exceeded by some places having completely different designs, especially with the underground places. However, this does not mean i didn't come across a few.. odd things. Graveyard houses with vault doors that require a harp to open only for them to have nothing inside, pillars being in odd places, and many npcs spinning around and on top of cauldrons with gnomes in them, and a few other small things like that. But i think there are so many other great parts of the game that greatly outweigh the bad. so yes i would recommend this game to people, but i would inform them on how it functions to see if the game is really for them. So please, keep on trying, i would love to see some of the things shown like cities and all sorts, if there is ANY hope whatsoever i would love to see this come back better than ever."

The reason I'm writing a positive and recommending you this game in the future is the modders. The modders of Cube World are hopefully going to fix Wollay's disaster making the game like it was in alpha and hopefully add new mechanics themselves. I'd wait about 2-3 more weeks. Either he comes out of hiding or the modders are just gonna fix the game themselves. The game has potential, it's not a bad game. There's many features that need rework and more content added. I will keep my faith more on the modders to make Cube World great again."

55353405,english,0,1128000,"Used to play the Alpha 6 years ago - I loved it. And before I get hate for disliking the new version: please hear me out. I honestly tried to love this game. Only played the new release myself for about half an hour atm, however I have seen countless of gameplay from the Beta. I conclude that in its current state, Cube World is sadly not worth playing.  The difficulty spike in the beginning, which basically forces you to avoid any combat, is not rewarding at all. Additionally, fighting isn't even encouraged as you don't earn XP from it (???). My main concern however is, that in an RPG which heavily focuses on EXPLORATION, you basically lose all your gear upon entering a new zone.  I can partially see what Wollay was trying to achieve with the gameplay style, but it just isn't fun. For me personally at least, and from what I've read many other ""legacy players"" think the same. Really hope that some of the current issues are resolved/changed in the future as I'd really want to recommend and enjoy this game.  I will continue to play this game to see how it evolves when playing it for a longer amount of time. If I change my mind about it, I will update this review accordingly."
55434073,english,1,1128000,"After 34 hours of gameplay and the completion of close to 6 regions, I can safely say that I haven't enjoyed a game this much in years and this is the first game, that I feel deserves my honest review.  First off, the exploration is great, the terrain looks amazing and the points of interest and cities are ususal well spread out making everywhere you go have something to do. There are some quirks in the generation like trees inside plateaus or water rising above the ground levels, but that makes it all the more fun to find and explore.  The combat is... cheesy, especially in the early and sometimes very late game of a region and when playing solo. But I have to say I enjoy it a lot. Finding that edge to make the bosses circle below you, leading them to shrines to quickly respawn, making them repeatedly lose interest in you or letting your friend be the bait. There are many ways to fight them and being creative is the way to go. Fight whichever way you prefer.  Now, the game has gear based progression and region locked gear/items. I've seen many complaints about this, but I don't really see any issues with it. At first glance it looks like it severly limits exploration, but when looking deeper into it, it really promotes detailed exploration within every region. Yes, losing the travel items can be a bit annoying, but once you figure out how to do things, gearing up and advancing in a region can go very quickly. And besides, what's the difference between monsters getting stronger or you getting weaker when moving to the next area? My only complaint is that the artifacts are kind of useless besides just showing them off to friends.  I've played around with the alpha, and I followed wol_lay on twitter for the past years to see how development was going. And I have to agree that, in my opinion, this release did underdeliver considering how long was worked on this game, but whatever the reasons are for this, I'm not blaming wol_lay, it's his project and I think he did an amazing job. Could it be better? Yes, of course, but for €20, this is totally worth it, and if he keeps development up (which we should definitely encourage), maybe this game will even surpass the expectations we had."

188151124,english,0,1128000,"I started playing way back in the alpha version of the game and we absolutely loved it, it was a game we always came back to often thought about and loved throughout the years eventhough it didnt have much content back then.  You can imagine how hyped we were when the full release of the game had been announced, we had given up all hope at that point but it turns out they didnt drop the game.  Well... coming back to the crushing reality. I wish they had dropped it. We had fun for the first few hours but there wasnt that much more content, they had removed a lot of the stuff we used to love and made the game fun for us. It could've just been a good memory.  We can't change it now, we have this abomination of a ruined game before us and there is nothing to do about it. If we have learned one thing from this experience, then simply not to give Picroma more money.  What a disappointment."
163167641,english,0,1128000,"The game is unfortunately bad. I wanted to like this game, its beautiful cubic world and wildlife, but with so many bad system choices. i cant find enjoyment out of it.   Getting crafting items is a tedious task because i cant find what i need. Every crafting component is scarce, so trying to get into crafting is useless. I would rather have a lot of crafting components across the map and needing a large amount to craft items, than having barley any components and little needed to craft items.  The combat was just bad. i played rouge and tried both the assassin and ninja. found the ninja to be less bad just because of its range attacks. still i found the combat to be a boring hack and slash where you start battles where you and the enemy mindlessly beat on each other until one of you fall.  Progression feels dull. The game has a system where you don't lvl up but you focus on getting better gear. This really isn't in the games favour, because with these different classes i expect to get new abilities as i progress, instead of just using the same abilities with a higher dps number. Having a skill tree would be awesome. This would make me feel like im becoming a better warrior, ninja, etc instead of just getting stronger damage output.  The region system made me absolutely stop playing. When i started the game i did a couple quests to get myself a glider and a boat. i was ready to set out to explore the world and all of a sudden i lost everything. Thats because the game only allow you to use the things you earned in the region it was gained. Imagine if you played breath of the wild and after completing the great plateau and leaving it. You found yourself unable to use the glider or anything until you got the sheikah tower of that region. That is cube world. I expected to get the boat and glider to make future exploration easier but it only does for the region you are in. maybe instead of having it that way. you could make it more like botw where you can get longer stamina, so that you can glide for a longer period. There are so many other ways to balance this better, than to take our stuff away from us.  From what i heard the dev is focusing on a successor that is supposed to take aim at making the alpha version a complete game. My only wish is that the people who bought this game doesn't have to buy the new one as well. This cube world game is not worth its 20 dollars, So i hope cube world omega is either going to be an update to this version or given to the people who bought this cube world for its 20 dollar price."

EDIT: Now there's that BetterProgression mod, and honestly this is what saved the actual game and experience, somehow making it better. Yet still, if a game needs mods to be playable, how does that give Picroma any credibility as a developer?  Before I start I'd like to mention that I also was an Alpha player, and this review will be heavily nostalgia-biased.  I remember getting this game 6 years ago. I remember actually playing the Alpha and doing so a lot even before the official release, throughout those 6 years. The info about the release was.. Astounding, and very sudden. It felt like a dream come true. That one, great RPG that was part of my teenhood was great and seeing that it was about to get a full release was great too.  I did not take part in the beta though. I dared to say I wanted to wait for the official release. Damn, I was brave enough to ignore all spoilers, the Reddit and the whole Cube World community so I could get the best experience on release as possible.  Sadly, I was disappointed. I told my friends to purchase the game so we could play multiplayer and that it would be an amazing experience, because the Alpha was great. But we've gone through a bad optimisation issue, Syncing was a pain, and the land generation (should we speak about generation at all actually?) took more than 3 minutes so we could move forward. A ping of ~5000ms was common.  With this, we quit multiplayer. Quite a disappointing outcome. All I saw was an RPG Roguelike becoming... Just a Roguelike. But not that, let me go for some things that I managed to see while playing Singleplayer:  - What first picked my mind when watching the game trailer was the lack of an XP bar. I first thought ""Yeah, that's fine, they probably just hid it somewhere"". Nothing more wrong. When I launched the game, I noticed that experience has gone COMPLETELY, while replacing it with some ""artifacts"". What's more, you'd expect them to incease your stats, but in fact those are some visual, exploration-related bonuses, that are so small you would not even notice.  - Region item lock. Seriously? This game in Alpha used to be about exploration, why is it supposed to punish us, the players, for wanting to explore? In the end I found out that my gameplay stopped at the first region I ended up in, and stuck there with all the equipment. Apparently there are some ""+"" items, that are allowed to be used in surrounding regions, but yet they're extremely rare (~1/50 chance) and not entirely worth the grind.  - Item rarity going from literal rarity to Tierness. You begin from Tier white, while beating stronger enemies and working through these tiers up to the highest, yellow level, defeating the original purpose of RPG and grinding in general.  - The skill tree being removed completely.  - The Hang Glider becoming even more useless now that you cannot increase it's speed like you did in Alpha with skills. Not to mention the terribly high stamina consumption.  - The Water Mage and Warrior are even more broken as ever.  - The Mage's hover literally replaces Climbing.  - The enemy AI is completely braindead at times, especially the bigger enemies, not knowing what to do in front of a single, breakable block.  - Progression tied to either RNG or cheesing abilities, usually the second one though, by abusing the aforementioned braindead AI and the surroundings.  - Some bugs that renders the gameplay kind of... Weird.  - The dev had a literal *week* to collect the Beta testers' opinions. What did we, the actual buyers actually get? As far as I'm aware, the exact same game. I'd love to see an actual delay in the release, if I were to get a more complete product that would actually get listened to the players' opinions and feedback.  - Additionally, most of the things Wollay posted on Twitter as teases for the game were not added in the game at all.  That's just a part of what I noticed so far. Wollay, you deceived us all, Alpha players. We were expecting a great update, with new content, with things that would make our gameplay actually engaging and interesting. The Alpha made us expect a better Alpha, but we actually got another game at all. I'm very disappointed to say, that until most of the issues mentioned above are fixed, I may stick to the original, Alpha version.  I do not mean any hate towards Wollay and his work. He did his best to give us the best Cube World experience possible, but I do not understand his way of handling this proces. I am sadly anxious about the future of this game, as no word of his took place after release. Either he just published and panicked due to the negativity or ran away with the money. Either way, we're dealing with an unprofessional dev, and I hope for the best.   Tl;dr A game that did not live up to its expectations, and a dev not having any contact with it's players. Not satisfied, if you're an alpha player, do not buy at all, if you're new, get it when a discount happens."
191523910,english,0,1128000,"Cube World had so much potential, especially after the promising alpha that got a lot of people excited. The voxel-based world, the exploration, and the RPG mechanics all seemed like they were building up to something great. But when the full release finally arrived, it just didn’t live up to expectations.  A lot of the mechanics that made the early version enjoyable were completely changed or removed, and the progression system felt more frustrating than rewarding. Instead of leveling up and growing stronger over time, everything resets whenever you enter a new region, making long-term character development feel pointless.  The world itself is still visually charming, and the movement and combat can be fun for a while, but the game lacks the depth needed to keep players invested. It’s a real shame because the foundation was there for something amazing. Instead, Cube World feels more like a hollow version of what could have been.  If you loved the alpha, you might find some enjoyment here, but be prepared for a very different experience. Otherwise, it’s hard to recommend, especially when so many other open-world RPGs do it better."

This game had infinite potential and the game was abandoned twice because the creator couldn't handle criticism. And it only gets worse because the second time he made promises, and it was no longer this fun side project, and when it didn't have everything it originally had and asking alpha players to rebuy the game for a larger price point effectively scammed thousands and thousands of people. I don't have hope for this game coming back.  The game can be fun with mods, removing alot of the issues, but at that point some of the mechanics you are still playing a worse version then the alpha, and because there is definitely gonna be no future content, there still isnt much of a point."

55451452,english,1,1128000,"For the longest time I have been searching for a casual game that I would be able to lean back and play with my friends. From Garry's Mod to Counter-strike, this game fills the void that no other game could. A lot of people are hating on the game because they've waited 6 years for it, and expected something totally different than what they wanted. They expected a masterpiece. Their masterpiece. This game won't fit everyone. It isn't easy. It takes time. People wanted this game to be so many things, and it wasn't what they expected because the game had changed from alpha to now. From a muddle mess to this amazing game. A game meant to bring people together, to fight challenging mobs, get loot, and explore the endless world. This game may not be what everyone wanted, but it is amazing nonetheless. All the people crying about it through their steam reviews are to idealistic to stray from what they WANTED the game to be. Cube World is not perfect, but it is a far cry from a bad game. If you give it time and effort, the game will reward you. Playing both solo and with friends, it isn't impossible. I love this game, and I think that if you are looking for a challenging, casual game to play by yourself or with friends, look no further. Go into this game with a clean mindset. It is a new game, it is not the alpha version from 6+ years ago."

55467589,english,1,1128000,"This game is amazing! Now take everything I say with a grain of salt saying as I never played the alpha because I couldn’t get it before it got taken down.  This game is great, but has its downsides. Pros: The game itself looks amazing The soundtrack is lovely The different classes and subclasses means everyone has something for them (for instance Scout and Beserker for me) The way enemies spawn seems better than what the alpha had (I believe the alpha was you spawned at 0 x 0 z and the further you went from 0, 0 the harder the enemies got, versus now regions have all different types of monsters just hanging about and different quests have different levels of monsters) And a whole lot more I could talk about  Cons:  The game has no tutorials, making learning what to do at the start a bit of a challenge if you didn’t play the alpha Items and armor are region locked (excluding artifacts and equipment+) which makes the game less “get good items and blitz the game” and more or less a restart every region.  The region system needs some improvement, the idea itself is good but the execution isn’t too hot, maybe if it were countries that took up the space of like 4 to 6 regions depending on how powerful the country is it would be better  Overall, I still enjoy the game, but there are definitely some things that could be improved, I feel confined to one region until I get good items in that region, but this game applies to a certain type of people and I don’t think it deserves the hate it’s getting, it’s not a bad game it could just use some improvement"

84324488,english,0,1128000,"The released version of the game is awful. I played the game back in 2013 before it was removed from Picroma's website and had high hopes for the full release. Wollay's bizarre strategy of removing the game from stores for almost a decade was a terrible one. He worked on the game sure, but with no player feedback. It's a game designed for him and him alone. The game is visually stunning that's for sure. That's about all it has going for it in it's current state.  The progression system is awful. Earning XP, leveling up, as well as the Skill Point system were all pruned from the game. The current progression system has you grinding gear like am ARPG, with the caviot of that gear being literally useless outside of the zone it is acquired in. I think this has an interesting Philosophy behind it, but when the game is focused around exploration and finding new zones, it feels terrible. You can spend a dozen hours grinding out the perfect set with just the stats you want, but if cross an invisible boundary you might as well have nothing equipped. This makes the game feel pointless. There is no point in killing ANYTHING in the open world. Enemies do not give XP, rarely ever drop items, and the items they do drop are low quality. So you spend most of the game just avoiding everything. The world feels hollow. The only way to get gear is by going to towns, talking to NPCs until they give you a map location to clear. The skill point system in the Alpha was atleast interesting as you could tailor your character towards a specific build, whereas in the full version of the game, the only improvements you can make to your character are how hard and fast you can auto attack.  Another thing of note is the difficulty of the game. There is no tutorial in game and very limited UI. The default UI has your only ability cooldown tucked into the bottom left corner of the screen, when your health, MP, and your focus are all going to be towards the center. You spawn in the wild right after making your character which is pretty flush and seamless, but if you're a new player, you'll quickly come to realize you don't know what to do. Again, this gives me the impression this is just Wollay's personal game that no one else is supposed to enjoy, let alone play. Any friend I've had try the game has quit within two hours of playing it due to the terrible new player experience. The enemy AI is terribly overpowered. Ranged and magic using enemies literally cannot miss so combat revolves around doing more damage to them before they kill you. The final nail in the coffin for me was the boomerang enemies. When they throw their boomerang, it has aggressive tracking and hardly ever misses, even with immunity frames while rolling. If and when it connects it doesn't return but instead glues onto your character doing constant damage for around 5 seconds. It only takes 2 boomerang throws to kill a newly created character. If your character is a boomerang user, it functions much differently to the point where you question if your boomerang is just cosmetic. Magic uses suffer a similar issue when they cast a tornado spell it moves along with the character they're targeting causing it to never miss, whereas when your character can cast tornado spells if you move your mouse even slightly the entire spell cancels. Somehow Wollay made the enemy AI worse to the point of being irredeemable.  It's really sad that the limited Alpha version of the game feels like it's had much more work and love put into it than the full release version with almost a decade to get the vision down. I hope Wollay reads some feedback for once and gets this game on track. It has a lot going for it. It's gorgeous and the core RPG concepts themselves have potential. It's like watching your crush get a train ran on her. Like why is she even at this party in the first place, she was such a good girl and could be with such a good guy but instead she's getting railed in exchange for xanax and alcohol."

121965642,english,1,1128000,"Ive always loved this game, Over the years i've showed people this game because its literal fun groups or even just to solo play and run wild. Mechanics from the early days i do miss but the game now is still very solid. I hope for the game to come back alive with more updates soon maybe even steam deck availability. Ive got plenty of new ideas for the game if youd be interested for updates Picroma. To anyone else reading ignore the bad reviews and give the game a try i promise its worth it."
114266002,english,0,1128000,The developer decided to put the game on steam and then never do anything with it. He took a bunch of peoples money and never updated the game. Dont buy it.
84122310,english,1,1128000,"The game is tolerable after you mod it. And even then it's a little questionable. Cute aesthetic.  I hope the mods fix the ridiculously HP'd enemies, terrible combat style, the weapon limitation per specialization, and the laser beam attacks that you can't dodge. An enemy shouldn't have 16k HP .____. Idk why that is a thing.   Mod's seem to region lock and help in enemy scaling but even then I seem to frequently get my shit rocked by a snail if i step two feet outside of the village.  The quests and aesthetic is great, I just wish it was more scaled/fair so that we aren't constantly dying."
176631585,english,1,1128000,"This game is a pretty decent game. The game definitely took a wrong turn whilst in development and it shouldve stayed more  closer to the alpha. The game is probably not worth 20 dollars but its still an extremely fun game if you have the dedication to play it. There are some huge flaws with the game that cause people to not buy it. 1. All players are on the same server with different regions and biomes, the problem with this is that players can spawn in a biome with insanely strong enemies and be very stuck. 2. All your equipment and gear downgrades to practically shit once you leave the region it was found in. 3. the leveling system is terrible consisting of collecting ""artifacts"" which barely increase any of your stats such as +3% climbing speed. Now for the upsides. 1. The graphics are amazing and the art and design is great. 2. the gear system i personally think is more improved than the alpha version as now its a star system instead of +1 2 3 etc. 3. Your given a wide verity of weapons to chose from 3 for each class each with its own attack speed, right click attack, and some of them you can dual wield. In short, Cube World steam version had almost achieved a perfect game but it strayed too far from the alpha, if you have a spare 20 dollars spare and looking for a grindy game, this is the game for you. (or if you want free just search up on google for alpha)"
175409709,english,0,1128000,"Really good concept but unfortunatly i cant recomend this as it is just a lvl 1 grinding simulator for every new area you go into. you dont ever feel like you get genuinly powerful and the few items that can scale across zones, + items, are random drops with no consistent way to get them ie. crafting questing etc. over all cool game idea but poorly executed and from reading some of the other reviews you may have seen that the prealpha was pretty fun and a good experience but this is just disapointing at the current state of it and im 90% sure they aren't updating it anymore, truely sad, not worth the $25 NZD."
178964740,english,1,1128000,"I played this game in the Alpha version a pretty long tome ago, so I have nostalgic memories of Cube World. I played it recently and bought the steam version and here's what I have to say about Cube World in general:  I truly believe this game likely would have been a titan in the ""block game"" category if the creator didn't take a hard left turn when updating it past alpha to put on steam. Alpha world generation is peak world generation, the game was simple and had an addictive gameplay loop. Improving skill trees, adding human companions, improving village generation (or making a quest based generation) could have been implemented to make the game perfect.  Cube World Steam Version changes the main gameplay loop entirely. crafting materials are rarer and loot drops are better, and there is no level restriction on equipment. The new gameplay loop is kill bosses, loot better gear, kill more bosses. The objective of Steam Version is to collect ""Artifacts"" around the biomes which give random improvements to abilities. Leaving a biome removes all the items collected and ""resets"" your character. This is a literal gameplay ""Loop."" Once you complete the first area, you have to do the exact same thing again from the bottom. Dying in steam version also sucks. Even with gear equal to the boss, you are still extremely likely to die if you don't cheese the boss. respawn areas are 1-3 entire minutes away from boss locations, so you are stuck holding W and maybe scrolling on your phone for 3 minutes just to die immediately and do it again. This is where I stopped playing Steam Version, fighting the highest level enemy with the highest level equipment and losing multiple times.   The alpha version is a craft/loot combination exploration game. You start out extremely weak, dying to every wild animal. Finding crafting materials and fighting the few enemies you can defeat lets you get better armor and use the very limited skill tree. Killing the bosses scattered around the map provides you with special crafting materials for weapons and a bunch of exp. As you level up, you can craft better gear and equip better gear. That is the gameplay loop of alpha Cube World. Craft and equip gear to kill difficult bosses, level up, craft more gear and fight more bosses. The distance between bosses in alpha is still obscene, but there are respawn points 15 seconds away from every boss, and the areas in between are filled out better with ore, crafting materials, and radiant bosses.  I really wish this game was moddable. Sadly, it seems that the developer made a lot of the code and programs very unfriendly to modders. The 4-5 mods for this game are not true scripted mods, but are instead mods that change 1 or 2 numbers of a variable.  Heres how I suggest enjoying cube world:  1. Buy the steam version and play it for a few hours. Don't hurt the developer because you don't like how they manage their game, they still deserve support for creating the game you are playing.   2. Look for the alpha version download online. Download that version and play it for a few hours as well. The game is very hard in the start because everything can kill you, so don't get discouraged right off the bat. There is little skill mechanics in the game, enemies auto lock attacks, have super far reach and attack faster than you can dodge. You are required to get better equipment to defeat enemies."
90147833,english,0,1128000,"Like many others, I played the alpha version and loved it. I achieved thousands of levels because of it and it stayed interesting  because of it's uniqueness of graphics and gameplay. I understand that the full release had to live up to the success of the Alpha but it tried too hard to be unique that it ultimately failed. The mechanic where different regions have a ""lock"" on your gear is, in my opinion, stupid. I can spend hours grinding for good gear in one area, but when I decide to explore this vast world some more, the game punishes you by locking your items. This game that promotes exploration with its vast, open world and many enemies also contradicts itself by essentially taking away all the gear you worked hard for at first. You can for sure fix these problems with mods, but players shouldn't have to fix a games problems themselves. I bought this game when it first came out on steam however so I didn't have much options when it came to mods. In short, buy the game if you don't care about downloading a few mods; normal vanilla gameplay doesn't do it for me though."
