181467107,english,0,949230,"To put it fairly, Cities: Skylines II isn't bad because it's abandoned or given any false promises. But rather, while there is indeed significant effort after release to fix and improve the game, the disastrous release has still left mountains of problems unresolved. And now while the game is probably at 60% confidence for [i]release[/i], it's already resuming selling cosmetics for coins, which is why I have to add a thumb down to it.  The disaster of CS2 is a combination of over ambition, terrible risk management and project planning. This game was built on weak foundations and has been heavily misdirected to keep stacking on it - namely, the economy simulation.   CS2's key feature and improvement over CS1 is the much more in-depth economy system with individual level citizen needs and more types of supply & demand. The bad news is this system has never worked. They started with embedding fake dummy figures to make it [i]look [/i]functional, then, after being picked out by players, reworked the math two or three times (I lost count if we are at economy 2.0 or 3.0). [b][i]It still does not work. [/i][/b] And more crucially, players have little to no way to make it work.   There are only very limited micro management tools which makes 80% of the stat charts in the game pointless - you can stare at them, but there is no way to respond to them. What's the point of having dozens of industry types when I can't even assign a district or building to a specific industry? What's the point of having a patch to ""give more salary to employees"" instead of making it something adjustable (e.g. minimum wage or income tax rate) in the first place?  CS2 essentially introduced an overly complex model to replace what's trivial but working in CS1, to achieve the exact same goal - to generate district demands - but failed to provide enough tools to players to integrate it as part of gameplay. There are so many gaps and vacancies between this simulation and the actual gameplay, that are either reserved for DLCs or simply overlooked. However, instead of filling the gaps by providing more policy tools,  more specialized city service types etc, the devs have only been cooking and recooking the math of the simulation... which is quite pointless.   This makes CS2 not qualify for a city simulation game. It's at best a [i]scene building [/i]game that is no way worth $40. Adding on with the performance downfalls, the modding dramas, and the unending list of [i]small [/i]bugs - all lead to the very same question: [b]why would you release the game in 2023, if it is still not ready after one year?[/b]"
188693448,english,0,949230,"Over 1 year after the release: - Still tons, tons of bugs?✔️ - Frequent unexpected crashes? ✔️ - Zero compatibility with mods? ✔️ - Still no proper modding tools? ✔️ - Unbalanced economy and population, terrible pathfinding? ✔️ - Zero optimalisation and incredibly high graphic requirements? ✔️ - Still a small portion of content in the SEQUEL, compared to the 1st game? ✔️ - Releasing paid DLC's to an unfinished and almost empty game? ✔️  Dont buy it, by any means don't do it. The game is in a pre-alpha version compared to what should have been and will be for a long, long time given the current ""development"" progress  ❗️❗️❗️ 24/03/2025 UPDATE because I want to address some of the comments and also mainly because I'm genuinely getting even more pissed off with this game, every time I'm getting back to it.  🔴 Regarding some most usual comments, @qG_CeRTiiFieD and @Saukuy already addressed them in the below section, so I will just paste them here. If there's a way to pin them or anything please let me know, so I can give more credit to these guys:  ""They're still working on it."" -It's been a year after release. Stop giving companies grace for releasing broken products. YOU are the reason why they keep doing it.  ""Your PC is trash."" -First of all, doesn't at all address 6/8 points provided. And for the only two it MIGHT address... this is a commonly reported issue with the game. Talk about fallacy. - personally I just want to add, for comparison, that I'm running KCD2 or Cyberpunk smoothly on very high settings, whilst my recommended setings for CS2 are low/very low...  ""Why did you play it for 176 hours"" -90% of reviews are from people who barely get past the introduction and then provide poor unhelpful feedback that doesn't actually tell potential users anything of note.  ""Try not comparing a ten year old game's content compared to a one year old game"" - All about the value proposition. If the game doesn't adequately innovate mechanics, while also offering substantially less than a previous iteration - what is the point of getting the new game?  🔴 As for the things that I have ommited previously and that make me pissed off even more (even though the game is objectively getting better of course):  - I can't stress it out enough how terrible the pathfinding is.  - Poor graphics - I mean honestly, the game is newer, but is it really better looking? Grass textures are hideous, we have cartoonish cars, bland and simply sad colors and design of many buildings. CS2 was released the same year as Baldur’s Gate 3, Hogwarts Legacy, Alan Wake 2 or Lies of P. Would you have guessed it? Absolutely not, UI is better and it's easier to build things, but that only distracts from the simple fact that the game is ugly. Jesus, compare it to Manor Lords...  - Texture clipping, uneven road zoning, incomprehensible downcasts or road shading, misterious holes in the terrain adjacent to the structures, in other words dozens of minor errors that you spend a solid hour trying to fix because they sting your eyes and you'll go crazy until you fix them  - Lack of many tools that would mimic CS1's absolutely essential mods, like Traffic Manager or Intersection Marking Tool for example. Jesus, we still can create much better organised and more detailed intersections in CS1 than here. How they couldn't simply include at least the first 3 pages of most popular CS1 mods in the new game? The receipe for a success was so simple...  - Still no bikes, quays, just a few types of roads and intersections etc. - again, JESUS CHRIST IT'S A SEQUEL AND THEY CUT OUT SO MUCH CONTENT, THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.  - Related to the previous sub-item - promenades? PAID DLC. Almost any leisure and entertainment? PAID DLC. A few modern buildings? PAID DLC. Any region pack, after adding just a few most basic ones? PAID DLCs.  Disgusting."
180847633,english,0,949230,"City Skylines 2: A Huge Step Backward!!!  I’ve been a dedicated fan of City Skylines 1, pouring over 1,200 hours into that game and thoroughly enjoying every moment of city-building and management. Naturally, I was excited for City Skylines 2, and despite the initial mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance. After spending 250+ hours trying to immerse myself in this sequel, I can confidently say it’s been a MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Last night was the FINAL STRAW. I played for about 4 hours, carefully building my city and manually saving my progress multiple times to ensure nothing would be lost. Yet, during my final save, the game CRASHED. I didn't check the game archive at the time, because that's the kind of thing I'm USED TO. (Well done, City Skylines 2 team—you’ve successfully conditioned players to lower their expectations and tolerate glaring mistakes as if they were just part of the package.) When I reopened it today, all my save FILES were COMPLETELY GONE. Everything I worked on vanished as if I had never played at all.  For a game that demands long-term planning and hours of investment, technical issues like crashes and save file corruption are UNFORGIVABLE. This is basic functionality, and the fact that such issues persist after the game’s launch is UNACCEPTABLE. While City Skylines 1 felt polished and reliable, its sequel feels like a rushed, buggy mess that UNDERMINES the player’s TRUST and PATIENCE.  Unless the developers address these critical issues immediately, I CAN NOT RECOMMEND City Skylines 2 to anyone. It’s A HEARTBREAKING STEP BACKWARD from a franchise I ONCE LOVED."
171930650,english,1,949230,"[h2] Intro [/h2] While I really enjoy the modern take on city building, Cities: Skylines 2 falls short in several areas I hoped would be improved from [i]CS:1[/i]. Although some features have been enhanced, many aspects feel very similar to the previous installment. Below are my thoughts, the good, the bad and the ugly!  [h3]Passing Thoughts[/h3] If you’re wondering whether it’s worth playing at the moment: [b]Yes and No.[/b] If you’re looking for a modern city builder and don’t mind some rough edges, then yes, it’s worth trying. However, if you prefer a more polished experience and want to wait until the issues are resolved, then it’s best to hold off.  [h3]The Good[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Engaging Sim Life:[/b] Just like in [i]Cities 1[/i], watching your sims go about their daily lives is a pleasure. The new feature allowing you to track a sim throughout its lifespan is a welcome addition. [*] [b]Improved Road System:[/b] The revamped road-building tool, including slip lanes for highways and dedicated turning lanes, is a significant improvement. While these features could have been added via mods in [i]Cities 1[/i], it’s great to see them included in the base game. [*] [b]Enhanced City Services:[/b] Power, water, and sewage now travel underground, eliminating the spaghetti-like pipes of the previous game. Additionally, there are more city service buildings available, offering varied services to your sims. [*] [b]Expandable Buildings:[/b] Many buildings now come with extra modules to increase their capacity. For instance, schools can be expanded with additional buildings, which reduces the need for numerous schools and service buildings as seen in [i]Cities 1[/i]. [*] [b]Mixed-Use Zoning:[/b] This feature, which I wished for in [i]Cities 1[/i], is now officially supported in [i]Cities 2[/i]. [/list]  [h3]The Bad[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Stagnant Gameplay:[/b] The game doesn’t evolve with city size. Managing a small city feels identical to managing a large one, unlike other city builders that offer varied and evolving gameplay. [*] [b]Lack of Challenges:[/b] There are no significant constraints or meaningful decisions. Problems are typically solved by simply ""building more,"" making the gameplay feel repetitive and flat. [*] [b]Limited Improvement:[/b] Although certain features, like highways, have seen improvements, fundamental issues with the grid layout and overall gameplay remain. These issues appear too deeply embedded to be resolved without a major overhaul in a future installment. [/list]  [h3]The Ugly[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Modding Platform Shift:[/b] Moving from the Steam Workshop to a third-party [i]'Paradox Mods'[/i] platform is a poor decision. Despite some solid features, this change detracts from the ease of modding that the first game provided. [*] [b]Poor Aesthetics: [/b]The grid-based design and focus on American urban sprawl lead to bland, unattractive cities. Specialized industry zones and modern industry representations are particularly weak, resulting in uninspired city layouts unless you sacrifice density. [*] [b]Bugs:[/b] The game still has several significant bugs, even after recent patches. For example, homeless people may remain indefinitely in your parks, which detracts from their intended use and overall enjoyment. Although the developers are aware of this issue, the lack of progress in addressing it is concerning. [/list]  [h3]Is It Worth It?[/h3] I wish Steam offered a middle-ground review option, rather than just ""Good"" or ""Bad."" While I enjoy the game, it remains quite rough around the edges. If you can tolerate some bugs and occasional issues, it might be worth trying. However, for most players, waiting [b]6 months+[/b] is probably the best option. Although I believe the game will have a long lifespan, I’m concerned that its poor initial reception might impact its future."
169445745,english,0,949230,"So this is from someone who played CS1 both modded and vanilla, with access to the DLCs (some features of which should have been in the base game, and others available as working mods from dedicated modders).  I would not recommend this game in it's current state, as it is buggy and does not work once the zombies take over (Note: This is not a zombie survival game).  UI			 	Roads will glitch when creating intersections, offramps, etc. (which is probably why they recently released a visual ""patch"" that allows adding pavement, etc.  	Your processing speed will slow down every time a zombie is created. How is a zombie created you may ask? Simple, if you purposely (or accidentally) destroy a building that houses any amount of people, those people will walk out to the street and just stand there, looking for a new place to live. But, since you most likely have an outside connection (*I even tried without an outside connection, still broken) those ""available"" homes will be taken by new people, and thus a zombie is created as ""Moving in"" or ""Idle"", if you destroyed a commercial zone, you create ""Shopping"" zombies. These citizens will stay in your city and slowly eat your processing power until your game speed of 3 is 10 minutes for an in game day to pass. Unsustainable, and game breaking (only the first of many game breaking issues with this game).  	Sometimes the weather works, and other times it does not and just ""glitches"" to the next day when it is sunny again.  Traffic			  	The AI doesn't respect lanes (no surprise that the AI still does not work when it comes to traffic), as they will turn in no turn lanes and do six to twelve point U-Turns wherever they can, multiple times. This is more common if you add or remove a road *anywhere* in your city, and it also happens when you add a sidewalk or crosswalk. This common task causes the AI to ""re-think"" and recalculate it's route, which causes them all to ""shift"" their routes.  		No individual lane control which means the dedicated turn lanes are determined by the angle of connecting the side roads, and a matter of one pixel will determine what the lanes do in response. Also, the traffic signals and signs are ""node"" specific, so there is no way to put a stop sign on just a sidestreet, etc., this was ""fixed"" in CS1 with mods.  	Cargo train stations are broken, they will not deliver goods between cargo stations, cargo airports, or cargo ships, and goods that are created locally from industry go no where, and commercial starts importing everything individually anyway, causing your industry to basically do nothing but create pollution.  	No weather related buildings (Heat, ice rink, sowplows, etc.), as they probably want money from a ""Snowfall"" like DLC from CS1	  Power/Water			  	Combustion banned zones should have increase power consumption, and there are no charging stations for EVs, only gas stations for fuel, ""Green Cities"" DLC?  	You can start a map importing power, but not water, so if you want to export water from the beginning tile you cannot (only for those that play with just 1 tile...)  	No water removing services, so enjoy those floods when you make a mistake.  Population			 		GAME BREAKING bug that I have no idea how it made it out of QA and passed Dev...zombie homeless just stand on the road taking up processing power, although some of them become homeless people that pay taxes and ""work"" but don't move into an available house or move out of your city (or actually ""go"" to work), and eventually become zombie robbers that kill your city...as mentioned earlier. This breaks your game in 1 way or another, I still don't understand how it made it out of Dev and QA and was released in this state. It is incredible how little it seems CO/Paradox cares anymore... 			 Healthcare			 	No deathcare	or childcare, probably want money from a ""Sunset Harbor""	like DLC from CS1  	The aforementioned zombies still negatively contribute to the overall health of the city, also killing your city, and when they get sick or die, healthcare and deathcare cannot ""pick"" them up so you get stuck with symbols flashing on your screen on of sick and dead homeless.  School			  	There are no preschools (or daycare) as mentioned earlier.  	No law school or dorms, probably want money from a ""Campus Life"" like DLC from CS1.  	More people ""stuck"" in building then ""eligible"" to be there, zombies live in schools and other buildings so even if a certain amount of people are eligible to go to school, they can't because every school is completely filled, until you have a map that is just elementary schools.  	Educated sims still become Robbers at an incredible rate, and soon you will have a city of Well-Educated Homeless Robbers who are Happy and Wealthy. Good luck getting rid of them, no amount of taxes or lack of city services will deter them.  Police 			 	Well, the police are currently broken as they cannot ""arrest"" homeless robbers, and since there is no way to control patrolling or set up stationary ""standing"" locations for police vehicles, 3 police cars will drive around chasing 1000 criminals in a town of 500 people, causing the crime to kill the city. At least my police helicopter flies 10 feet south above my river on it's routine patrol, just to turn around and land. Also fun to watch my 3 police cars drive into a crime scene, look at the robber (or group of robbers as the AI just stand there) and then drive away without making an arrest. 		 Fire			  	A waste of money being ""on"" all the time as they don't help with traffic accidents or house-calls for EMS, or hospital, etc. Can just turn it on when a disaster strikes or a fire starts, but other than that it is super expensive to do very little. 			 Parks			  	No ""Parklife"" benefits, i.e parks built on sidewalks, etc. Also, no amusement parks, zoos, aquariums, etc. because, of course, they probably want money from a ""Parklife"" like DLC from CS1.  	No ""professional"" sports	 stadiums (which I believe was actually free from ""Sports Venue"" DLC)  	Trees are easier to plant, but can no longer ""clean"" polluted ground, and do very little, if anything, in stopping noise pollution.  Disaster			  	When an area floods, there is no way to remove the water without destroying buildings and using landscaping tools to ""push"" the water back. Cars will just drive through it, zoneable buildings will ""build"" underwater staying in a permanent destroyed state, and other buildings will just stop working unless you notice the water surrounding it.		  	Only tornadoes and forest fires (every 10 minutes or so, without fail), and no disaster routes or control of the shelters that are available, probably  because they want money from a ""Natural Disasters"" like DLC from CS1.	 			 Zones			  	No real district control, as there are laughable amount of polices (that do very little, imo).  	No historical buildings (no way to ""save"" a building model you like to preserve it)  	No hotels/motel/gas station manual control, even though it is purposely built into the Economy 2.0, again things that were basic in the ""After-Dark"" (Leisure and Tourist spec, etc.), ""Hotels & Retreats"" and ""Green Cities"" DLCs.	  	No ""industry zones"" which means no control of what ""companies"" move in, even though this is a big deal in Economy 2.0.  No way in vanilla to even see company info.  	No standalone warehouses or industry/company specific warehouse control to pick from, again because ""Industries"" DLC	made this available in CS1, another paid DLC.  	Zoning ""too much"" will create broken empty buildings, common in industry creating ""warehouse"" UI models, but no company will ever move in, or houses that remain empty even though homeless people are looking to move into a house (or college kids moving out of their parent's house live in a park or become a zombie instead of moving into one of these buildings), or you will get 5 of the same company in a row (or 5 gas stations, albeit different companies) in a row, or very close to each other."
178543649,english,0,949230,"I wanted to like CS2, but I can’t recommend it. The base game is boring, and you need mods to make it interesting and to fix basic glitches. Unfortunately, that led to my first-ever malware after 28 years of PC gaming, all because CS2 lacks basic protections—like two-factor authentication for mod uploads. Thankfully, the malware seems to only target crypto, which I stay away from, but that risk is too big to ignore. I am done with this game, and don't know if I will be back."
165142706,english,0,949230,"I have been waiting for some update to past before writing a review for C:S2.  If you want a city builder and nothing more, go for the original; If you want to build your own city with style, go for the original with dlc; If you want realistic simulation, go for the original with mods until your cpu is cooked; If you want to use the game as a sand box and go for pure beauty, go for the original with asset until your gpu is cooked; If you want to use mod and asset, go for the original which has !! STEAM WORKSHOP BUILD-IN !!, no 3rd party bs;  YES THEY EVEN MAKE THE WORKSHOP A THIRD PARTY THING SO NO MORE EASY CLICK FOR MODDING.  This does NOT worth even HALF of its price in current stage."
173953297,english,0,949230,"so after  over 400 hours, and 50 hours since last update, i'm furious with this game. i've never seen so many different unrelated glitches in one game. i never leave reviews, but i had to get this off my chest. the longer you play on the same map, the more glitches appear, which is so frustrating, i spend hours and hours working on one single city, and by the time i get to a population of 100k, the entire city is so broken it becomes unplayable. things that were working fine when i started a map, start breaking, the land itself starts glitching, a wall of dirt will appear around your city, the buildings wont level up. the ocean level will magically jump 10 feet, flooding anything close to the water. when i say its a broken game i mean its broken."
190371276,english,0,949230,"This game is still a [b] disaster [/b] after a year and a half, If you're interested, it's March 2025, the game is still not optimized, lags are starting at 40k population AI is dumb, despite the promises of the developers, they will never find the best route to avoid traffic jams. The game is still not optimized. A broken economy. Broken death system, bodies will always grow, hearse will never be used at 100% Because of the stupid AI, emergency services will not be able to reach their destination in time, they will always take the longest route. Strange responses from a community manager who in August 2023 said, Don't criticize our developers and don't be toxic, otherwise we will stop answer you. [h2] No Steam Workshop [/h2]   We have a Paradox Mods inside the game, and you know what? The mod community is dead, no beautiful buildings that we had in CS 1, no fixes to AI from modders ~NOTHING~ Less than a year later after ""realease"" , Paradox tried to sell the DLC, but failed. Instead of Patches, they give us Region Packs. thx bro  This is a huge disappointment, [h1] Don't buy it!!! [/h1] better buy CS 1, Huge mod community and more polished"
174951039,english,0,949230,"[b]I wouldn't say ""don't buy this game"": I just wish I hadn't bought it so that I could still enjoy CS1.[/b]  It's been a year since the turbulent release and except for resolved the critical bugs, the game is still not on-par compared to the first game's quality and content.  With regular crashes-to-desktops and game-simulation speed grinding down to a halt after 150K-200K population;   [b]there is no point in being creative[/b] (you're already unable to, since there isn't much content to suit your narrative yet) [b]there is no point in being expansive[/b] (because after some point, each simulation minute takes five minutes) [b]there is no point in discovering[/b] (because you cannot spend your skill points without an either-or question, it's never both unless you play with 'everything unlocked')  There [u]are[/u] improvements to the first game, such as mixed-zoning and road-building --which I'm also angry about because now I can't go back to the first game after getting used to the comfort of these newer mechanics.  I'm in such a state that I can play neither the first nor the second game with actual enjoyment."
177024877,english,0,949230,"One year later and the game is still missing integral features that were literally promised in the promotional material. The economy still doesn't actually function, meaning you will not see goods from your industries travel across your town; everything just teleports as needed.  Your finances make no sense because somehow you just get more money but cannot figure out where it is coming from, resulting in there being no way to fail. It's also great to see their CEO literally _lie_ about features of the game before release, and then _blame the customers_ when the reception to their half-baked pile of shit is poor.  This game is not only bad, it's literal consumer fraud. Colossal Order have burned to ashes whatever positive sentiment I once held for them."
178876442,english,0,949230,CS2 has been out for over a year what we learned:  It's in an incomplete state. the switch from steam workshop to Paradox mods has caused a crypto wallet stealing virus to be widely spread. They are sort of listening to fans but are ignoring a ton of community concerns and requests The other reviews cover the rest of the pros and cons of this game.
183690450,english,0,949230,"Well, after almost 100 Hours, guess it's Review time...  First, I bought the Ultimate Edition when the game came out, over a year ago by now...in hindsight I shouldn't have done that. But as we all know, hindsight is 20/20…  The Release was awful, dare I say, one of the worst states a game came out I have every personally seen. This game should have NEVER been released in the form it was. I generally like Paradox, I played a lot of their games, some way too much. Same with Colossal, I have over 500 Hours in Cities Skylines 1, but the way this was released, to be frank, I should have refunded it.  Even though all this was bad, you could say terrible, at least Colossal Order communicated with the community, though to be clear, it doesn't change the fact that this should have never been sold as a full price game, because the initial release was more like an alpha test.  I checked every time there was an update and yes they did their best to update it as fast as possible, fixing bugs, improving performance. After 1 or 2 months or so it was playable, performance wise, but the economy was kind of broken.  After a while I lost interest in the game, without modding, the game was dead for me, a waste of €90.  I checked again when FINALLY modding came, Paradox's own ""Workshop"" came, Paradox Mods for CS2. But finding out that ""for now"" we will only have code mods, so no new Buildings made by the community to enhance the game to where CS1 was at that time, was a bummer. In hopes that that would come soon, I gave it a chance. But soon was not so soon...  I lost Interest again and didn't play the game for half a year. To this day, 25th, December 2024, we still don't have close to what came for CS1 over the years. Now one could say with the region packs there is something and I want to thank all the people involved in those for what they made. But why don't we have building mods the way we had them in CS1?  To be frank, I lost hope for this game, I wish this will become what CS1 became, but my gut feeling is that this game is more or less written off as a loss, never to be finished the way it was meant to be in the devs minds. I wish, and I want to be wrong about that. But my gut tells me otherwise    And that's why, for me, for now, I can't recommend buying this game. After over a Year, it is still in a State that feel horrible and I personally have to say, from now on I will be careful with buying Ultimate Editions of games from Paradox, before CS2 they had that trust, that many others lost already, with this they lost that. What a disappointment.   If any of the developers read this. I am sorry, but you probably know as much, if not better, that this should have never been released the way it was. I personally, as a customer, rather wait longer for a product and get a product that is in good shape, then getting what we got. To compare it with something. This release felt like I just bought a car, without Engine, with the promise that that will be delivered soon, and it was just not in stock. Without a steering Wheel and doors."
177184040,english,1,949230,"If you've never played a Cities game play CS1, then with DLC, then with mods first. Come to this if you're a fan of that and want a graphical update, economy, and gameplay change. However, despite this CS1 will always be better for a long time. That is solely because of the amount of time updates, DLC, and mods have flooded into the community. Each fix of CS2 is a step towards the right direction but it doesn't overshadow the fact that the launch was very disappointing. It should never be standard in the industry.   Performance and stability has improved since launch for me. Pretty playable and the essential mods from CS1 are here. It's also a very pretty game but CS2 is not without its flaws including some occasional crashes. Consistent updates will help but buyers beware. This game is a slow burn towards what it can become.  Overall I would say this is a cautiously positive 6/10"
190555071,english,0,949230,Love the fact i Spent over 100 dollars on a single video game to make sure i'd receive all post launch content. Just to be laughed at and asked to spend another 35 dollars not even a year an a half later. Deplorable greed is going to be the downfall of this glorified city painter. Id recommend just play SIM city. Im done supporting this trash company.
166501755,english,0,949230,"I have almost 1200 hours in CS1. I bought it the day it came out and played on and off religiously for almost 10 years. Yes, it was nearly the perfect city builder at launch and was only consistently made better by the modding community.  I was absolute overjoyed when I saw the release trailer for CS2, so much so I took a vacation day so I would be able to dedicate the entire day to playing it when it launched.  Leading up to launch day I ignored the early access reviews and kept telling myself its just nonsense. Launch day comes and I was heartbroken. Poorly optimized, no mod support, no map editor, almost no changes that were promised were working, and the game was nearly unplayable due to crashing and freezing. I still held off on giving a poor review.  8 months later I see that mod support and map editing are in beta, and that the game has been optimized better. I re-download the game and hop in and things look promising. Load into a new game and the moment i go to lay my first road the game crashes. Just completely disappears off my screen. Load back in, new map downloaded from the mod store and it loads in completely dark, no UI anywhere and I couldnt even exit the game because the escape key wouldnt open the menu.  Alt+F4 and uninstalled again. I have 1.1 hours in this game and about 45 minutes of that was browsing the mod store. I can't even being to explain how disappointed and saddened i am over this. I have less and less time to dedicate to gaming now that i am approaching my 40s and CS was ALWAYS the game i could hop into and know i could relax and enjoy. It seems i cant even lay a single road almost a year into launch for a game i paid full price for.  Shame on Colossal Order, i am so disappointed."

But I think I'm at the point where I'm done. I pre-purchased the base edition and ""played"" during launch week, if you want to call it that. I completely understood launch issues and even the fact, many weeks afterward, that they were rushed to get this game out. By this point, not much has changed. I have 2 main issues that I just can't get over.  1. I realize this an extreme personal preference but the idea that we cannot get more pre-made intersection and interchange assets, even if by community modders, kills a lot of enjoyment for me. Call it lack of creativity or intelligence, but I'd rather worry about the layout of the city and not trying to find ways to make a kindergarten level highway interchange for myself. Something the first game did wonderfully in my view.   2. This is much more general of a complaint that my first issue kinda ties into. I keep asking myself, ""What have I gained by playing Cities Skylines 2 instead of the first game?"" Some people would have to point this out to me because, with my play-style, I can't think of much. Defiantly not enough to warrant the money, time, and patience I've put into this game.  I have come to the conclusion that I am no longer going to put any more hope into this game. I feel I've waited long enough and with all respect to the devs, I will uninstall this one and just go back to the first one. Maybe even continue to buy DLC's for it. But I refuse to put anymore faith in a game that is, essentially, a worse quality version of it's previous game. I would honestly love a refund for this game. I would maybe even use the refund to put back into DLC's for the first Cities. But fat chance of that by now.   I want to make it clear that I've been on steam for close to 15 years and I've rarely....RARELY left a bad review. Even when a game was absolute garbage. I would just uninstall and chalk it up as a loss. But this is different. I vividly remember when the first Cities came out and it was a godsend. Sim City had gone so far downhill that I commented to my wife, ""This is what the new Sim City should have been!"" Unfortunately, it only took Cities one game cycle for it to fall into the same hole. One could ask, ""What happened?"" Or  worse off, ""What's happening,"" since it hasn't gotten much past the point of, ""At least it runs...kind of.""  Conclusion, and it saddens my heart to say it, but if you're considering buying this game...just don't. Not even on sale. Buy the first one and save yourself the trouble and actually have some fun."
176134262,english,0,949230,"Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game at the moment (3/10). After 200 hours of trying to enjoy it, I’ve been disappointed by the lack of honesty from the developers. This version of the game is, at best, in a beta stage and feels like an insult to the many fans of the first game. Numerous features are missing, and we all know why: they’ll be sold as DLC, just to squeeze more money out of us.  Update January 16: The free addition of Creator Packs brings renewed appeal to the game and enhances diversity in city creation. This is a step in the right direction, but there is still much to be done."
188885073,english,0,949230,"After eagerly anticipating the sequel to one of my favorite city builders, Cities Skylines 2 has been nothing but a disappointment. I pre-ordered the maximum version, investing significantly in what I hoped would be an amazing follow-up, but my excitement quickly turned to frustration.  The gameplay and economy have been simplified to the point of being uninteresting. Where the original game offered depth and strategic challenge, the sequel presents shallow mechanics that fail to engage long-term players. Most frustrating is that the DLC strategy focuses entirely on cosmetic additions rather than expanding gameplay with meaningful functional elements.   Also game not received the Ukrainian language support, which feels like an oversight given the global nature of the player base.  Technical issues have plagued the game since launch, with numerous bugs remaining unfixed for over a year. The developers seem more interested in pushing out visual DLC than addressing these fundamental problems.  The final straw came when the game crashed during a save operation. Upon restarting, I discovered all my save files were corrupted and completely unrecoverable - dozens of hours of careful city planning and building completely erased in an instant. This level of instability is simply unacceptable for a full-priced game with paid DLC.  I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2 in its current state, especially to fans of the original. Wait for significant patches or deep discounts before considering this disappointing sequel."
178222959,english,0,949230,"Cities: Skylines II is a promising game that has made significant improvements since its launch. However, it still falls short of its predecessor and the lofty expectations set by its developers.  The recent security breach, where malicious code was uploaded through the mod system, is a major setback. This incident highlights a serious lack of oversight and raises concerns about the developers' competence.  Given these issues, I have decided to uninstall the game. It's unfortunate to see such a potentially great game tarnished by poor development choices and security lapses."
174971013,english,1,949230,"Colossal Order please re watch your own promotion video from 5 years ago by Justin Roczniak/donoteat01 and listen to what he says. That's what a good city simulation needs to be able to do, on top of being a good looking city painter.     Its a start but still has some odd design. I think the worst part is somehow its more sterile and overly clean felling than the first game. Shame on Paradox for pushing this out the door long before it was ready. Making hardware requirements this high end was a fundamental misread of your audience. City builders are traditionally played on mid range systems and laptops and by people who often don't prioritize cutting edge first person shooter/ action game graphics."
186093265,english,0,949230,"So many issues. You better have a huge C:\ drive because this game, no matter where you install it, sends all mod folders and downloaded content there. And you can't change it. They decided to have their own workshop platform, despite the fact that Steam workshop was perfectly adequate - and so far, they've distributed actual malware to their players, held up mods for almost a year straight, the game has to refresh 4 times in the main menu and you have to restart it several times.  I'm currently in a dilemma where I can't even access the game at all, even when launching with mods disabled. Round of applause for Paradox and CO please. These complaints don't even scratch the surface, have a glance at other reviews to appreciate the scale of ineptitude. Maybe buy this in 5 years? When they've figured out the basics. Because at the moment, it is a horrible headache of a game."

185833970,english,0,949230,"I have never been so conflicted.  I have re-downloaded CS2 about 5 times now, compelled by the overwhelming amount of beautiful showcases of CS2 cities on r/CitiesSkylines. Every time I have re-download CS2, I am immediately reminded why I uninstalled it. I want to like this game, I love the realism of the graphics, the animations of the sims, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and of course the option to make an intersection into a round-a-bout.  Unfortunately despite all of these new features CS2 compares nothing to CS1, I must admit, I do play with all the CS1 add-ons and was extremely disappointed when I first played CS2 to see I could no longer make my own custom university, airport, or park. Even despite all the additional content of CS1, it still prevails as the better game. If not for it's lack of bugs and glitches, then be for the lack of malware issues.  Never before have I wanted, nor even considered writing a review about a game, not even my favourite games, not even the masterpiece that is CS1, but the existence of CS2 conflicts me. I want to like the game, I want to play the game, I want to enjoy the game, but yet I don't. As the sequel to CS1, CS2 looks amazing, and it's features and game play pull me away from CS1, but its bugs, glitches, and, lack of customisation push me into a weird spot where I can't bring myself to play either game, a feeling so weird, it compelled me to write my first and probably only review."
170579341,english,0,949230,"Ok, cards on the table, I was really excited to see the new release after so many years. But to our dismay, you have somehow ruined it in ways we did not expect.   Pros:  1. better graphics 2. cooler looking city services buildings  Cons: 1. Graphics have STEEP performance requirements.  2. A lot of terrain tools were removed.  3. even on a rig equiped with a ryzen 9 with the 3090 and over 64 gigs of ram, i lag down to 10 fps. 4. population 10,000 lag starts opposed to the 30,000 population that the old game allowed before lag started. 5. Chirper is replaced by radio that wont shut up. even when paused, i hear it. Dear devs, old chirper was annoying enough, but it astonishes me how you've found ways to make it worse. 6. Infrastructure buildings became MASSIVE. so massive in fact, that instead of adding public transport as a feature to your city, your city is a feature of your transit buildings.  7. you can no longer tell where a majority of your path-finding is going on. in the old game, i could tell where a lot of vehicles were trying to go, so i could optimize. here, its all guesswork. not fun. 8. no access to the steam workshop, however you did add your own store so that people who had their mods here, lost their traffic.  9. money. no matter what i do in this game, after SO long with the first one, i cannot for the life of me stay in the green. No amount of tutorials, even COPYING youtuber's ""successful"" cities. i always find myself needing to take out loans.  10. lack of road options. I want a 6 lane avenue with bike lanes and tram lanes for starters.  11. Bugs. i understand that games have bugs on early access, and really early years, but this is some Bethesda level stuff here.  12. you tried so hard to make a continuation of your game to make money, but you are driving away people because you provoke us to write reviews like THIS!

177252074,english,0,949230,"As a huge fan of the first Cities: Skylines, which—despite becoming a classic Paradox DLC cash grab—still worked and worked well across the board, I had high hopes for the much-anticipated sequel. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Cities: Skylines 2.  The game is plagued by endless bugs that seem to multiply with every patch. Every ""fix"" only introduces more issues, leaving the game barely functional. The so-called ""Economy 2.0"" update? A joke. All it does is give you slightly less starting money, nothing more. The game has been out for almost a year, and we're still missing basic features like hotels. And when you ask about it on the forums, the developers respond with cheery emoticons, telling you to turn on developer mode and manually install them yourself.  Are you kidding me? You can't fix something this simple? Do you even realize that the only reason people didn’t refund your game in the first 20 minutes is because they trusted you? And what did you do? You slapped us in the face. Honestly, I feel like a clown for sticking with this mess for 184 hours, hoping you'd finally get your act together.  Screw you, Paradox. You've earned it."

Given your reputation and resources, it’s baffling that such issues persist. I expected better. This frustration makes me question whether game development is the right industry for you. Perhaps a career in something like insurance—less reliant on delivering a functional product—might be more fitting. At least then, people like me could avoid this level of disappointment. Please take this as feedback to improve, not just for this game but for future projects. Gamers deserve better.  Fuck you.  Sincerely, A truly dissatisfied customer"
188024915,english,0,949230,"I hate the way that it lags, the way that it stutters, I hate the way that it plays  I hate the game, I always need to actually push myself just to start the game and then closed it after the pop up launcher showed up.  I was excited to jump into Cities: Skylines II after hours playing cities skyline 1 on steam and my PS4, expecting an improved city-building experience, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and better option at building road (overall yes, more mechanism than CS 1)  what I got was a game that runs like a broken-down Porsche Mauser tank.  Let’s address the elephant in the room: Cities: Skylines II is horribly optimized. The fact that they list an RTX 3080 as the recommended GPU is ridiculous, frame rates are inconsistent, stuttering is constant, and performance tanks as your city grows. It’s frustrating when a game that should be about creativity and smooth management ends up feeling like an endurance test for your PC/laptop.  I was never asking for ultra-realistic, almost dull graphics. The original Cities: Skylines had a clean, semi-stylized look that made cities feel vibrant and inviting. Cities: Skylines II, on the other hand, leans too hard into realism, making everything look too muted and uninspiring. The lighting feels off, textures look muddy despite the “improvements,” and overall, it lacks the charm of the first game.  hard to enjoy when it runs so poorly, I really like CS1 the way the semi-stylized look....even though the animations were simpler, they had a certain charm that made the city feel alive. I like to see a dog turns into a car, I like to see thousand of people summoning their own car or bike after leaving stadium with angry after their team losing. It kills the immersion rather than enhancing it.   I find myself wanting to go back to Cities: Skylines 1, that's still something that CS 2 can't replicate even after 1 year, 3 months, and 23 days after release."

I put over a hundred hours in it, and I regret that. The bones of the base game are better than CS1, but it just needs more time in the oven and more features in the base game.  I also really resent that Paradox saw fit to release it when they did. It's emblematic of a company that doesn't respect its customers and willfully ignores what its devs are likely telling management."
172636255,english,0,949230,"I bought this game shortly after launch. Despite its initial flaws, I held out hope that the devs would provide patch updates that fixed the issues with game play. Now, despite months since launch and several patches released, the game remains virtually unplayable. Patches meant to fix the game bring about other, larger issues somehow, and it remains painfully obvious that the developers had no business releasing this game when they did. Cities: Skylines 1 became popular in no small part due to the flawed release of another city simulator, and they apparently learned nothing from that situation. I cannot recommend this game."

The development focus appears to have switched from trying to fix the base game and to endless $$$ DLC."
170585435,english,0,949230,I don't care about the performance of the game unlike the majority of the negative comments. My complaints are entirely gameplay related.  1. Can't build rail bridges over ship routes in rivers/lakes. The developers had almost a year to fix this. 2. Game randomly crashes. No mods installed. 3. Simulation isn't what it used to be in Cities Skylines 1. 4. No steam workshop. Why not? 5. Tons of features in CS 1 that were cut out of CS 2. Too many to name.

192329091,english,0,949230,"As someone who loved the original Cities: Skylines, I came into Cities: Skylines 2 with high hopes. The first game had tons of content, and the Steam Workshop support made it even better. Unfortunately, this isn’t a review of the first game — and that’s where my disappointment starts.  Cities: Skylines 2 improves on a lot of systems from the original. There are some great quality-of-life changes that make city-building smoother and more modern. But even with those improvements, the overall experience feels lacking.  I pre-ordered the game and received 15 DLCs (I believe) as part of the bonus, but most of them are just building reskins or region-specific buildings that don’t add any real gameplay. It’s hard not to compare that to the DLCs for the first game, or the workshop where I could find similar — or better — content for free. What’s worse, the two DLCs I did buy for the first game (which added meaningful content) are completely missing in the sequel.  It’s hard not to feel like Cities: Skylines 2 was rushed out and monetized aggressively. Despite being out for a while, it still lacks the depth and charm of its predecessor. On top of that, I experience random frame drops and lag, even though my PC should be more than capable of handling the game.  Right now, I can’t recommend Cities: Skylines 2. If you’re deciding between the two, the first game still offers a better experience overall — even today. That said, I’ll be checking back periodically to see how it evolves. If things improve significantly, I’ll happily update this review."
186238355,english,0,949230,I have a love hate for this game. I love the mixed zones and all the great features we had to use mods to get in the first game.   However this game crashes all the time. And someone at the company operates with half a brain cell and thought we should leave auto saves toggled off by default. On a game that crashes. The constant crashes and that one setting alone makes me not want to play anymore.  I'll come back in a year or two when they've got their act together.

CS2 still has some distance to gain in those respects, but definitely don't rule it out. As the devs start matching the features from CS1 as well as building new features and in-game abilities, CS2 will be quite the superior city builder.

168892554,english,1,949230,"Cities Skylines 2 has had a bit of a rocky start, and I believe it's due in part because of Paradox probably pushing to get CS2 out earlier than it ought to have, and CO being the victim of its success with CS1 that it's set expectation way into the stratosphere.  That being said, with the release of the Economy 2.0 and the now additional assets just released, I would say if you've been on the fence about getting CS2, then I think now is a good time to get into it.  CO have been working hard on getting optimising the performance. They have listened to the community and have retracted the beach property DLC and incorparated them into the main vanilla game instead. They have reworked the economy which is a welcome change and actually makes the game a challenge and fun to play. The newly released assets are fantastic additions that now allow me to build smaller communities, and cul-de-sacs!!  The game still has more promise. When CO release a working version of an asset editor, this game will explode with potential. There's already some fantastic modders and content creators who are able to make truly stunning cities.  If you're happy to mod your game, and are into high level detail, then I advise you check out Sully's youtube video on detailing Snowdonia. It is utterly breathtaking. This is what I wanted from CS2 and Im glad we have it.  I'm not one of these people who set unrealisticly high expectations. I knew full well that any base version of  second game will be a rough diamond. Much like CS1 was when it released. CS1.  Very much enjoy this game."
175366797,english,0,949230,"It was one of the few games I was really looking forward to and bought it day one. It was disapointing launch and I didn´t play it for awhile. but somehow playing it now after multiple patches and fixes it feels even worse then launch. Expenses seem unreasonably high, graphics look cartoonish and washed (streets and houses look flat and bland), industry makes no sense and there is a feeling that there is no life in the city, just random cars and people. There is a high demand for high residencial, but no demand for shops or factories? Makes no sense. You need to have car access to park? Why? Garbage piles up so fast in 10k population city. No bike roads, electric cars and busses have no impact, people complain about noise when living in downtown area. Game crashes frequently. FPS has improved over the updates, but still its nowhere near acceptable for a high end PC."
173755312,english,0,949230,"BACKSTORY I bought ""Cities: Skylines II"" knowing that the public's reception of the game has been largely negative since its release. I eventually decided to try it out for myself—to form my own opinion. The first game, ""Cities: Skylines,"" was great. I immediately fell in love with designing, building, and optimizing interchanges. After years of play well-supported by both the developer and an incredible modding community that furnished a robust Steam Workshop, the game began to show its age. Enabling a handful of specific mods became standard practice, and certain shortcomings that neither developer nor modder could overcome were revealed. This showed the community that there was room for a sequel of sorts, a second iteration of the game designed from the ground up with certain improvements and capabilities in mind.  Among the aforementioned mods were ""Move It,"" ""Network Anarchy,"" ""Precision Engineering,"" and ""Traffic Manager."" The tools and quality-of-life improvements these mods provided players in turn provided the developer a starting list of features the sequel should include.  MY EXPERIENCE To the developer's credit, many of these improvements made their way into ""Cities: Skylines II."" From a road-building perspective, the underlying code for how roads are managed seems to have received a nice rework and the game has some great new methods for constructing intersections and the like. Sadly, some of these features lack refinement. Some cause glitches while others simply don't behave quite how one might want. For example, connecting two roads *can* work out nicely, OR it can cause the steepest mountains (completely impervious to terraforming tools) to erupt from the median reaching for the heavens.  FINAL IMPRESSIONS All of this leaves the player passionately yearning for what is clearly possible, yet heartbroken seeing it left just out of reach. I think the game has great potential, but lacks polish. It feels unrefined and incomplete. I'm confident the playerbase will create mods to help, but the game will never reach its full potential without corrective action from the developer.  It is also worth noting that a newer, well-spec'd gaming laptop struggles at times to handle the game in its current state. I get the impression that the game is not optimized very well. For reference, I have been experiencing issues while running the game on an ""ROG Strix SCAR 16 (2023) G634"" (Product Name: G634JY-XS97) (SKU: 90NR0D91-M001B0).  Now, I, personally, am left with the decision between requesting a refund (before I sink too many hours into the game) and keeping the game (relying on the developer to fix it). Ultimately, I will likely keep the game in hopes that my purchase will help fund an effort to improve the game. However, if I was more strapped for cash, I would undoubtedly request a refund. At this time, I would recommend anyone tight on funds to abstain from purchasing this product."
175264664,english,0,949230,"I spent hours and i mean hours on a city nd detailed as much as i wanted just for when i saved it, it completely froze my whole computer, and when i refreshed my pc, the save file for my world just disappeared like it never existed.

I might not be able to get the motivation to play again after this."
172054722,english,1,949230,"Good city builder but good god this game is poorly optimized. Be prepared for lots of sudden FPS drops. The economy and detailing updates have made it worth playing, although I would recommend picking it up on sale."

It had a rocky start with quite a few bugs that needed to be ironed out, but now it's much more playable, especially since the 'high rent' bug has been fixed. I do wish there was an option to toggle off icons in general—maybe there’s a mod for that, though I prefer playing unmodded for now. There are definitely some features from the first game that I wish would make their way into this one, like toll roads, and it would be great if disasters were made even more disastrous.  I like that they’ve made this version more challenging compared to how it felt at launch. Initially, it felt too easy, and I advanced through all the milestones quickly. However, what I still don’t like—and maybe I’m just bad at it—is dealing with traffic. No matter what I try, I can't seem to fully eliminate it.  If you enjoyed the first one and are still on the fence, I think it's time to jump off and give this one a try."

Since the beginning I've dealt with periods of desktop crashes, thank goodness for auto save. Then we'll chug along for a while without crashes. New update comes out, crashes return. Now I get some system log error every time I boot up the game. I've read forums, I've combed through steam, I've uninstalled and reinstalled 5 times now - it won't go away. Supposedly there's a fix but you have to comb through a folder of never ending files, download additional software to identify the failure and then reformat the file. Look, I just want to play the game. I shouldn't have to become a software engineer to play  a game I spent decent money on. I don't know what's going on over at Colossal Order or Paradox, but they need to get their heads out of where the sun doesn't shine. Both entities should be embarrassed.

I've since purchased it again and, with the mods available, I've been enjoying it. The performance has improved greatly for me and so it's been worth it HOWEVER, I must have missed the memo about auto-save being OFF BY DEFAULT and lost 8 hours of game-play when it crashed. I hadn't had any crashes up to that point so I guess it was pretty stable. I do recommend the game but I think there are some really basics things missed. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
190526022,english,1,949230,"Compared to SC1, there's a lot missing. I liked the fishing boats, the concerts / stadiums (and traffic chaos!) and most of  all - making huge beautiful parks :(. Very stable now though, much higher res than SC1 and overall very fun. Just missing anything unique - like would like to see a lot more ""character"" though downloading the paradox mods (japan, eastern europe, china etc) does cover some of that. It's a really good game, but SC1 set the bar VERY high - I really hope these guys use that as motivation to match it and don't just give up"

190668962,english,1,949230,"When I got this game, I had a prejudice. This came from the flood of negative reviews, flaming the developers for being slow to update, avoiding the community, in-game bugs, and the high price. I played the game, and since then (december) I have genuinely not been bored. This game exceeded my low expectations with flying colors, and it just makes me think that maybe the community is a bit ungrateful. Paradox has created a modernized version of the amazing Cities: Skylines 1, which has aged like fine wine, and has changed and added everything you could imagine.  Are there more things to be done? Absolutely. But this does not mean that it is unplayable or unjust (price). If you are looking to purchase Cities: Skylines II, don't get discouraged by other. Trust me, you'll love it."

188522075,english,1,949230,"The best features of this game are road management and how the benefits and struggles of dense urban development are simulated. Everything else I think could be reworked or updated and made better, and that's what I've seen since I bought this release week. I've had performance issues with this game that have made me want to throw out my PC, I've seen bugs that make me wish the refund policy stretched out to years. Almost a year and a half into the active development/fixing of this game, it's very fun and very playable, with mods that make the experience close to what I expected at launch.  The real problem is how much goodwill the publisher spent at launch. They'll never get that trust back until people like myself with long memories have moved on, and ironically the game is good enough I can't imagine when that would be, personally. I hope they keep making it better, more expansive, with buildings and tools to make the cities I've wanted to build since day one. But the community is probably irreversibly cooked, if you're here for good vibes you need to look elsewhere."
182609643,english,0,949230,"As a professional urban designer and planner (who loved the original Cities Skylines), I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I loved the first game, but this sequel has really left A LOT to be desired and, for the price point, I don't think it's worth buying at all.   The graphics are only marginally better than the previous game (perhaps the smallest margin I've ever seen), and the editability and variety of buildings is much less than the previous game. In fact, I find the variety of buildings in this game appalling. The service buildings are generic and, in many cases, hideous. The same goes for the houses, and many of the apartment buildings too. It's like they took context studies from the greater suburbs of Wichita-- even some of the European buildings. Just absolutely terrible.   In Urban Design, we say ""design for the city you want, not the city you have""-- and I wish the game designers considered this when they were making these lackluster, ""C"" grade building varieties.   The developers obviously rushed it to completion and gave us a low-calorie version with the intention of upselling us on expansion packs for any good content, but I think they went too far on this one. It's unreasonable to charge this amount for a game that is lacking this much, Buyer beware, you'd be better off sticking with the first game."

Any existing casual player will now have to rebuild their city or start from scratch learn the game all over again.  All of this because some PRO players complained of no late game challenges.  Not EVERYONE has time to commit to playing a game 24/7 and not everyone understands how a patch changes the game play.

I'm having a blast with it.

Negative reviews come mostly from buhs (fixed all since the launch already) and paradox economic policies (useless DLC, prices for bugged product, etc).   Differences from any other city-builders: the game literally simulates every citizen instead of visually represent mathematric calculation. Thus, there is no other city builder like CS2: you face literally same challanges as city designers from real life. Most of your time you are challanged by traffic issues, and this is not like in other games. Just try it, and you'll not decide to refund."

174549267,english,0,949230,"I have had this game just under a year now and I think it's time to talk about it. I will start off by saying it was pretty good for me when I started, I personally had little to no issues upon release, now I have pretty much been unable to play the game in months, since June really. Built a huge city with lots going on, seemed balanced well and thriving, was pretty good until the recent updates that i guess all but totally destroyed my city, and to add that I have yet downloaded or tried one mod on CS2 to date. Recent launcher problems have also made my game unable to start half the time these days, doesn't load up or endlessly tries to update to no avail, just keeps spinning and wont let me start playing. It also doesn't want to stop either when I exit it, steam just keeps saying ""Stopping"" until it restart my computer. When I can get it started now lots of broken things in my city, death rate spiked to over 7000 a day and I cant make enough creamatoriums to take care of it, plus they cause air pollution nearby, but still need to be near residential areas or be efficient. So I put down a dozen of them anyway with upgrades to try and help, says I can process around 4,300ish of the 7,000 a day im dealing with. Then my game stopped letting me place objects or roads, wont let me select anything, saved the game and came back and still can't do anything now?!?! so 80 hours in this game of working on this city and they've made it truly virtually unplayable, now I all of a sudden cant even select, place, or do anything now but watch the time go by??? I loved CS1 so much that I preordered this game and paid for the extras and all that, gave up over $100 on this game after the taxes and it's more buggy now than at release? (at least for me) like wtf x1,000. I am running a 14700k with a rtx 4080 GPU (all updates and even latest BIOS release following intel's recent scandal) so I personally do not feel I should be having these issues with a once thriving vanilla (mod free) city, regardless that I started it upon release. Not sure if I'm being forced to start a whole new city or what, I tried, just did not feel like going thru the measures again to slowly build up all that, unlock everything again to use, etc. I am just so disappointed after the entire summer and all these patches and updates my game is virtually unplayable now due to whatever these weird bugs are I am getting. If anyone can help me figure out how to save my city and keep using it, I am all ears. The game plays thru smoothly and like normal, no hardware issues, hiccups, or anything like that, but as for the bugs and not being able to select items or build right now, I am unsure how to go forward. Also why with only a little over 300,000 people they are dying all over the city at 7000 a day seems overkill, water quality is and has been fine, pollution buildings are strategically places around the map so the air current is flowing away from and not toward the city or residential areas. Healthcare is above adequate, in fact of all the hospital and clinic coverage only about 100 people are currently using all those healthcare cervices (seems like they would be utilized more but CS2 has not had any major uses or spikes in need for hospitals, just that I need to have them in reasonable distances from people to have access, but really they they seem extraordinarily underused. But right now all I see are hearse notifications everywhere and despite building more deathcare not much is happening to alleviate, prob just clogging up all my streets with hearses now too. This game's issues and annoyances has just really killed my enjoyment of city building. I cannot say I would recommend to anyone new to this game going any further of buying this game or anything else from this franchise until we start seeing some real improvements. All the updates and fixes sound real nice, but its kinda been nothing for me. Also as nice as the game can look, I gotta say with a 144Hz 4K screen and great hardware to run it all, the atmosphere just feels bleak and overcast, dull color scheme, its not very vibrant at all, and for a game in 2024 this could/should be better, maybe they are using too many textures when zoomed out, I dont know, but it looks absolutely nothing like the vibrant clean city you see on the cover. I have better screen shots from CS1 of my old city's skyline than you can hope to get from this game. That graphic they put on a cover, I cant even say that was from this game at all, totally just an artist rendition (or AI art) of what the game should be. There is absolutely no way to build a city that looks like that cover graphic and take a screenshot and share it with us without doctoring the pic, maybe mods to add these sailboats and such, enhancements to make the color scheme more vibrant and bloom, and even then all that it will not look like this city in the pic LOL. In 2024 there is not reason this game could not look like the cover art. I dont even like even playing EA's last Sims City release due to the small amount of buildable land and such. I will say though that game from 10 years ago could more closely visually look like this cover art than SC2, but SC2 visually is a far cry from EA's Sim City. SC2 is a good city simulation game when it works, love the way you can build highway systems now and the huge maps, but visually lacking. Now I am not one for a sim game to feel like graphics and frame rates are a must have, but they certainly could have done better with the lighting and smoothing affects especially when zoomed out. Will say again that CS2 was a great game the first 7 or 8 months I was playing it, but I should not have to start a new city in hopes it will work better than my existing city just because they have had to update it so many times. Then after the appalling CS2 release last year Civ 7 wants $130 for the ""Founders Edition"" or the $100 for the deluxe, but they basically want to double the price of the base game for the promise of stuff (that half should arguably be in the base game anyway and then the extra $30 for what they are offering eventually in the founders) when on top of that all the Civ game franchises are fun but hardly worth truly playing until all the expansions do come out to actually complete the game play. I hope that game has less bugs and CS2 but these days we the gamers are doomed to suffer high price releases that we now have to be the Beta testers for the developers to pick and choose what and when they want to fix broken games. At least No Man's Sky has not asked more than the price of the base game from DAY ONE and they can still continue to fix, update, and improve the game without asking for more $$ at every turn... or more importantly before they EVEN DID IT!!! Sorry but saving the potential DLC $$ to buy the deluxe on CS2 has in reality saved me $0.00 while costing me to this day more than $1 per hour to play a broken game that is now basically unplayable in this state... plus they have still not delivered on ANY the additional content I have so far paid for (not for lack of trying with the beach houses DLC they tried to slip in to justify a $5 or $10 DLC, which they had to backpeddle on and now gave out for free). I will say I when I preordered Civ 5 deluxe for the $100 back then I did feel like I got value for it over time, but how much should we really be giving out up front for unfinished games and ""TBD"" DLC releases. It's becoming too much for too little and this game has left a very sour taste in my mouth for paying full price and for ""deluxe"" extras that are more overpriced and undelivered."

NOT MODDED or MODDED Transit somewhere somehow locks up and doesnt move. Rebuilding entire lines works for a small while then locks up.[Waste of time} Re routing lines, same. new paths, same. {ALL a great waste of time} Whats the point of a city game if the transit {the heart of any city above 25,000 people} bugs out. The game is very pretty. but is NOWHERE near the level of a game that Cities 1 is. Never have i seen a game where the previous version is a whole lot better. I dont know where Cities Skyline dropped the ball. They left Sim City to build a better city game and did so with Cities 1, And Now this game feels like a blown up, less cartoonized version of Sim City 3000. LAME!!! I want so badly to love this game. it has so much potential. but after it being out since oct 2023, and no fix to big problems i am fast losing faith in this franchise. To bad. This is one of my most favorite game. Getting real tired of spending all this money on stuff that DOESNT WORK."
173042765,english,1,949230,"It'a fun game, but it needs more time. I feel bad for the devs who were forced to release early so I get that.

165688863,english,0,949230,"Do NOT buy this game. Would get a refund if I could... Went back to this game over 6 months after release, now that mods have been out for a little while, game is still unplayable.... Tried a few mods, half don't work, half are pointless when they do work, not doing nearly what it was described to do. Economy, land values, and demand for industry, commercial, residential etc. are all still way bugged or unbalanced. Nothing seems to make sense for demand, just seems like random bars fluctuating every new save. And there's no effect when you ignore the demand too. This game is very incomplete compared to what they advertised this game would be able to do. Don't even get me started on how insanely STUPID the traffic AI is in CS2.... I thought drivers in real life were idiots... but wow the AI is on another level of dumb.  If you're not running on a beast of a rig with all the latest and most new hardware, your in-game simulation will come to almost a complete halt when your city population is barely over 50-70k... Right when I finally get to a point that my city is growing, flourishing economy, and looking like an actual city, the simulation just cooks my CPU and runs slower than 1x speed, even when turned onto 3x speed. You cant make any real progress or see the effects of your new construction until HOURS of real life time later.. it was taking over 10 seconds in real time for just 1 minute of in game time to pass last night. My simulation made it through the first 2 years very quickly, then once my population approached 60k, it took almost 8 hours of real life time to get through just 3 months of one year in game.  I know a lot of the above has everything to do with computer specs, but MOST people don't have a 4000 series video card and the latest and greatest processer etc... any mid/low level rig, any rig thats slightly dated, is going to run into the above issues I'm having. That's a problem when your game isnt optimized to work smoothly on a mid level computer, even when turned down to the lowest settings the game can go.  Overall, since I can't get a refund, I'm going to hope that maybe one day in a year or two, this game will be in a playable state. Until then CO and paradox have lost my faith entirely and I will not be giving them a cent more of my money. Complete your game before talking to your community about PURCHASABLE DLC... nobody wants to purchase anything from you guys until the game actually works... Foolish that developers get away with something like this, feels like such a scam."
191032362,english,0,949230,Wasted 5 hours of my free time on a nice relaxing gaming Sunday building one of the better infrastructures that I ever have.  Then it crashed wiping out all my work for the day.  I'll take a bit of the blame as well for not having saved at points but to not have an auto save feature turned on automatically is wild with the inconsistencies this game contains.    Gameplay wise it has much improved over launch but that doesn't matter if you can't regulate these inconsistencies and in turn disrespect the players time.  Video games in themselves can already be time wasting but to have my time wasted by a form of entertainment is very disheartening.   TLDR: TURN ON AUTOSAVE UNDER OPTIONS

170127694,english,0,949230,"The game feels like its missing so much. Paradox Classic Maneuver to make sales of their DLCs. There is a feeling like the game should have a little more personality but it lacks much difference from one city to another other than geography. Eventually one city will feel like your other city after a time as the sprawl grows ever wider and wider. The economic and design choices you make seem to have little effect, character or meaning. Just increase your tax flow and keep building more and more neighborhoods.  I would only recommend only for the most die hard city manager fans and 4x players. Newbies and Average Customers will find the depth that they try to bring will be lacking in anything physical or visual.   TLDR: Needs more, lacks personality, only for fans and no one else."

165478853,english,1,949230,"Almost seven months after launch this game is still not were it is supposed to. While some of the new features, like the amazing road building tools, quality of buildings and assets, and the addition of seasons, are great, it still lacks other features  that the first game had at launch and bugs and smaller oddities happen frequently. However, there is no denying that the developers have been hard at work fixing the performance and other issues and I commend them for that. Their transparency towards the community is also appreciated. I believe that at least some of the blame for the catasrophic launch must be put on the publisher, Paradox Interactive. The developers were clearly unhappy with the state of the game in October but were not given the time they needed. And now, CS2 will probably live with a negative stigma forever.  What keeps me playing right now is not the developer‘s work, though. Once again, the CS modding community is coming to the rescue. While mod support should have been there at launch, the speed at which mods and assets have now become available is nothing short of amazing. It feels like every week there is a new exciting mod that enhances the game futher, sometimes adding CS1 features into CS2, sometimes going beyond what was prevoiously possible. From fixing land value problems, allowing for more freedom in road and prop placement or improving control over the traffic system and, of course, providing a range of visual tweaks, there is something for every play style. With all of this, I find myself playing for hours on end again, something that I simply couldn‘t do at launch due to all of the constraints. Now, thanks to mods (which are easily accesible through the game), CS2 has come much, much closer to the game I‘d like it to be. If you pefer a non-modded experience, don‘t buy the game. Wait for future updates which introduce much needed features (overground metro stations, please?). But if you‘re like me and you love building detailled cities and don‘t mind installing mods, then wait for a discount, get the game at a good price, watch some mod reviews on YouTube (I recommemd City Planner Plays‘ video) and have fun."
166781221,english,0,949230,"I can get around 117 FPS on a RTX 4090 FE, which is surely a good improvement from when the game first launched (40 FPS tops).  The lack of workshop support sucks. The new modding tools are neat, however. They also fixed most rendering issues with the roads, and now it doesn't look like I'm opening a portal to the sea dimension whenever I try to make a curved road.  Still a lot to improve, however.

I have medical facilities, police, education, post, garbage etc all in green zones, happiness is max, population is trending up, but I CANNOT get demand for residential despite having built numerous amenities and lowering taxes to the point of offering to pay people to move in.   Now, with 45k+ residents, all my work is for nothing because every business that the city has demanded without any RES demand is now ""Unable to find labor"" - Demand screen says having OPEN JOBS will increase Residential Demand, I have not had residential demand since 4 hours into the city. Don't waste your time building a city up because the demand does not work and you will be left with massive labor shortages and a dying city."

Then i realized a few things didn't work, like the post office for example (among other things I can't remember at this point), so I stopped playing.  2. In early 2024 the game got patched. I start playing again and everything seemed fine, until I realize something else didn't work, so I stopped playing.  3. As of August 2024, the game got patched yet again. I played for a few hours and it was great, until i realized the homeless people accumulate in the city, making the game unplayable. So i stopped playing again waiting for a new patch.  I honestly don't care all that much about obsessively detailing a city. I just want to play I game that works, and Cities Skylines 2 doesn't."
178165799,english,0,949230,"UPDATE: They are releasing paid DLC, the most recent at the time of writing advertising 60 new buildings. There are, however, only 36 new buildings, and the other 24 are recolored versions of the first 36. This is not reflected on the DLC price and is not informed to the buyers. It is also the second time they pulled this stunt with a DLC.  Aside from all other (completely valid) complaints that other people have about the game, I'll touch on another issue that is less talked about.  The developers provided access to mods through their own in-game platform, Paradox Mods, instead of the already well established Steam Workshop. Their excuse was that this approach allowed for mods to be available on the console version as well; a reminder: [b] said console version has not been released and has no foreseeable release date [/b], all we know is that there's plans for it. Why not use the Steam workshop for now, then, instead of building a completely new mod delivery system whose development effort clearly detracts from the main goal of... you know... actually fixing the game's critical gameplay problems? Who knows. Nevertheless, yesterday they published a warning; [b] a malicious file was detected in one of the most used mods on Paradox Mods [/b], a security breach that just never would have happened on the Steam Workshop. They said that they were sorry about it and had already removed the file, but provided instructions for people who used the mod to run malware scans on their PCs because the mod with the malicious file stayed on the platform for a while.  That's right, folks, y'all can't even trust this game to be free of malware. For your own safety, just DO NOT BUY AND/OR INSTALL THIS GAME AND ESPECIALLY ITS MODDING FEATURES. Trust me, it's not worth it, the other aspects of the game suck too and they are not dedicating enough resources to make it good. Just save your money and go play the first game.  Have a good one."

156405585,english,0,949230,"After spending almost 150 hours in this game it’s safe to say I’ve given up.  I’ve mostly ignored all the comments at first so that I can give an impartial view of this game.   Foremost, Cities Skylines 2 is broken. It is riddled with many serious algorithmic and performance bugs that affect core functions of the game. Widely reported bugs such as frequent crashes and taxation glitch, which causes unexpected income and deficit spikes that breaks the gameplay — and this is just one of many serious ones out there   While it is understandable for bugs to be present in games and software, Colossal Order’s lack of urgency and genuine interest in tackling bug reports makes it unacceptable.   It’s been 3 months since launch, yet recent statements from the company were deliberate in evading questions on roadmaps for bug fixes, and attempt to obfuscate users by saying that something is being worked on for the near future.   Hard to believe that this is the same company that made Cities Skylines 1 — a realisation of what the company once was. For now, stay away until more is done.   —  (Quick update — 29 Jan)  I’ve given this game another shot with a fresh install and a new city — issues remain and let me summarize my experience  - At first glance, Cities Skylines 2 provides many quality-of-life improvements compared to Cities Skylines 1, such as better road building and modern assets.  - You’ll find that it is now a breeze to build roads, highways and intersections, tools are intuitive and easy to use. Want an intersection? Just drag across an existing road and you’ll have an intersection. Want a roundabout? Just plop it down.  - Assets are refreshed as compared Cities Skylines 1, gone are the cartoonish buildings and vehicles.   However, most of the gamebreaking issues start occurring as you progress into the game.   Game stability and optimization - As your population increases, game simulation will slow to a crawl — despite my setup being well above the recommended specs  - Occurs on my two different cities and save files.   Service Mechanics - Garbage management and healthcare vehicles will regularly depart from their facility and return almost immediately (alerts will popup frequently that healthcare and garbage management is inadequate despite well within their capacity) - Buses, trams and trains will frequently and randomly despawn or stop working completely.   Economy and industry - Taxation for industries will become highly erratic due to an algorithmic bug, taxation income will fluctuate randomly by the millions for a town of 10k citizens. Completely breaks the budgeting and financial system.  - Local industries will not export goods, cargo terminals (both air and train) will hoard all mail and breaking the mailing system (also impacts citizen happiness) - As confirmed by many others, due to a land value bug, prices will increase to astronomical levels, which makes residential suitability zero for most parts of your city and its outer suburbs.  - This the most critical bug since it completely stops the progress of your city and game, as residential demand will be zero, and no new citizens can move in.   These are just some of the numerous bugs I came across while playing this game —  you do find yourself having to look up online for any workarounds whenever you come across one.   While I’m almost certain that these issues will be addressed eventually in the future.. but is this what it is expected of a published game that cost $50? Was this game ready to be published in the first place?   After two gameplays and two cities, one thing is certain for me — Cities Skylines 2 would not have passed QA and should not have been published in the state it is in. This game is in beta."
162086856,english,0,949230,"Generally speaking I don't like to do reviews, I know they're beneficial for the community and they help buyers decide, but return policies exist for a reason, and that reason is so that people can try it, decide if they like it on their own, and then return it.  That being said, when something is in such a state of horror that it defies logic, I think it's my duty to save you, the reader, from making the same mistake I did...  I have been playing City Builder games since before a lot of you were born, I started with the first Sim City in 1989 and have been an avid fan of the genre ever since.  I love how the genre evolved over time and the games became more complex and at the same time more rewarding.  It's my idea of a perfect saturday afternoon, sitting down, listening to some chill music, and watching as my planning unfolds into this megalopolis that was in my head.  I love it so much that I had even started my 4-year-old daughter down the path by having her sit with me and picking and choosing where we placed certain things in Cities Skylines 1 and showing her how the different mods worked..  When I saw the advertisements for Cities Skylines 2 I foamed at the mouth with excitement, and my daughter was over the moon that we were going to get a new, better game that promised many more hours of enjoyment.  We decided to purchase the top package that guaranteed us the most bang for our buck and the not yet released but announced DLCs that would add stuff as we started a new city together.  We stayed home on game release day to make sure we were among the first to download and start building our new shiny city together.  Much to our dismay however, the game was slow, clunky and basically unplayable on a Threadripper 3960X w/ 128GB Of DDR4 and 2x RTX 3090's.  We were sad to say the least, but we still had hope.    People started sharing settings, then official announcements came with other settings, and we finally stopped having 13fps and got it up to 30fps.  So it was playable, right?  Well, not really.  There was still masssive stutter from time to time, especially when inside of game menus... I mean, they're menus, why on earth are they causing the FPS to plummet and dropping dozens of frames?  It was, and still is so bad, that it randomly causes the USB to reset and the famous Windows chimes that tell you when a USB has disconnected, and reconnected play through the speakers.  And then a patch was announced that promised to fix some of the biggest problems with performance, so we stayed home again, only to be let down once again.  There was maybe a 5 percent performance increase overall, and the menu's were still causing massive game lag.  CO admitted fault and released patch after patch after patch in quick succession, that we were overjoyed that soon we would get to be able to enjoy the game...   But that time never came...    CO stopped patching, but promised that they would not release any of the DLC and more paid content until they got the base game right, because that is what was most important to them...  Another promise... another let down...  Now, not only did they release a paid DLC before fixing the game, they had to gall to charge $9.99 for it.  Bare in mind here, I paid for the deluxe edition, so it was ""free"" for me, but it also let me know how much extra I would really be getting for the extra money I spent, and it doesn't seem like much...   If I had one piece of advice for anyone looking to buy this game in its current state, it would be to run, very fast, in the opposite direction of your computer screen...  I cannot n good conscience recommend that anyone buy this game.  Instead, take your family out for a dinner, go see a movie, go spend your money on anything else, just don't buy this game.  I would recommend spending the night in a trap house or a shooting gallery before I would recommend you purchase this game...  So thanks Colossal Order, for not only stealing my money, but also disappointing my daughter...  Shame on you and Paradox interactive for releasing such a steaming pile of garbage..."
159724986,english,0,949230,"Cities: Skylines II - the game where everything is made up and nothing matters.   Its the game equivalent of the DJ pushing all kind of buttons on his mixer that is not plugged in while an mp3 just plays on his ipod.   Do not spend money on the game in its current state if you expect a city builder that actually simulates the behaviour and movement of people and  goods. Right now the game is just a tool to build something that looks visually like a city but has no inner logic or function. People and vehicles are just animated background noise. Their behaviour barely influences any important metric and all your game play decisions don't influences them alt all. A few examples:  - I build a ore mine on an island with no road connection. Before i could even finish the passenger ship connection there are 60 workers employed at the mine that must have swam over there. I finish the ship connection but not a single physical person steps onto the island. Looking at the stats the mine is producing a couple hundred tons of ore per month. Not a single truck moves anything out of the mine to the cargo terminal.   WHY DO I BUILD A PASSENGER AND CARGO CONNECTIONS WHEN PEOPLE AND PHYSICAL GOODS DO NOT EVEN NEED THEM?? IN A CITY BUILDING GAME THAT IS ALL ABOUT MANAGING THE FLOW OF PEOPLE AND GOODS???  - Because the animated people and cars/trucks that you see in the game have absolutely no influence if your city works or not all your game play decisions have no real consequences. You would think if you build a shitty city where people are stuck in traffic and cant get to work there will be a negative consequence. But because the person doesnt need to be physically present at work it matters zero if you build a highway from their door to the office or have no physical connection at all. There is no motivation to do anything because there is no consequences either way.  - The people physically present in the game do not behave in a way that is understandable. You click on a random person just getting of the train leaving the station to find out that they are going to work on the other end of the map where the train just came from. because there is no way to show the actual path you have no clue why they took the train away from their destination.  - even if we ignore that the game has no internal logic and rules your still building ghost towns. my current build of 10k people looks like a big city with highrises and all but there are maybe 1/10th of the actual people around. no real traffic problems because there are very few cars around. If you think that is because of public transportation think again, busses trams and co have mostly 1 -5% utilisation. The industry that is on paper producing thousand tons of goods have the occasional truck driving around.   - rush hour does not work at all. All streets have a graph that shows the traffic flow over the course of the day and every single road has a flat line that does not vary depending on time. If you have only every tenth person on the road at least have them leave their house all at the same time.  In conclusion I'm very disappointed that they spend so much time to develop a super complex ""simulation"" and then decided that non of it actually matters. It feels you are looking at a animated picture of a city while there is a complicated excel spreadsheet  on the other monitor crushing random number and they hope you are dumb enough not to notice that they have nothing to do with each other."
181467107,english,0,949230,"To put it fairly, Cities: Skylines II isn't bad because it's abandoned or given any false promises. But rather, while there is indeed significant effort after release to fix and improve the game, the disastrous release has still left mountains of problems unresolved. And now while the game is probably at 60% confidence for [i]release[/i], it's already resuming selling cosmetics for coins, which is why I have to add a thumb down to it.  The disaster of CS2 is a combination of over ambition, terrible risk management and project planning. This game was built on weak foundations and has been heavily misdirected to keep stacking on it - namely, the economy simulation.   CS2's key feature and improvement over CS1 is the much more in-depth economy system with individual level citizen needs and more types of supply & demand. The bad news is this system has never worked. They started with embedding fake dummy figures to make it [i]look [/i]functional, then, after being picked out by players, reworked the math two or three times (I lost count if we are at economy 2.0 or 3.0). [b][i]It still does not work. [/i][/b] And more crucially, players have little to no way to make it work.   There are only very limited micro management tools which makes 80% of the stat charts in the game pointless - you can stare at them, but there is no way to respond to them. What's the point of having dozens of industry types when I can't even assign a district or building to a specific industry? What's the point of having a patch to ""give more salary to employees"" instead of making it something adjustable (e.g. minimum wage or income tax rate) in the first place?  CS2 essentially introduced an overly complex model to replace what's trivial but working in CS1, to achieve the exact same goal - to generate district demands - but failed to provide enough tools to players to integrate it as part of gameplay. There are so many gaps and vacancies between this simulation and the actual gameplay, that are either reserved for DLCs or simply overlooked. However, instead of filling the gaps by providing more policy tools,  more specialized city service types etc, the devs have only been cooking and recooking the math of the simulation... which is quite pointless.   This makes CS2 not qualify for a city simulation game. It's at best a [i]scene building [/i]game that is no way worth $40. Adding on with the performance downfalls, the modding dramas, and the unending list of [i]small [/i]bugs - all lead to the very same question: [b]why would you release the game in 2023, if it is still not ready after one year?[/b]"
160957874,english,0,949230,"I say this with no hyperbole, this game is so bafflingly bad it arguably has destroyed Colossal Order's reputation.  Cities: Skylines 1 arguably revived the city building genre and was a critical darling. It had flaws, but it was at its core a product with legs and heart behind it, and its community was well earned.  Cities: Skylines 2 feels like a cheap mobile game, like World Box or something, where you just place objects and get pretty views.  On the one hand, a lot of people play Cities as more of a model set rather than mechanical game, so in some ways Cities 2 is 'better' because you can get a prettier view... but the default assets often are very repetitive and you can't currently mod in anything to get variety or to customize your city, and many of the mechanical aspects of the game dramatically interfere with making a city that looks just the way you want it. So while you can get some good shots that look sort of like a real city, you can't get some of those magical moments you can in Cities 1 where you set up everything juuuust right and have created a city of your dreams.  So the game launched without real custom cities, but it could lean on its simulation aspects... if it had any.   Cities 2 promised to up the fidelity of the simulation to, frankly, silly and unbelievable levels. I never believed you would really be able to follow individual cims and see that they have a cohesive life, so the fact that doesn't actually work is fine. The idea of trying to accurately model and track literally tens of thousands of interacting agents is stupid.  The problem is almost no simulated element actually works. Cities 1 took a lot of shortcuts for its simulation, but it had an internal logic that made sense and facilitated the core challenge of a city builder: conflicting needs of different types of activity in a city putting pressure on your ability to lay things out and connect them, because while things didn't have formalized connections, you still had a clear logic of what sort of resource would be demanded by what zone you plop, and where they were likely to come from. Did it make sense that the industry building that was nominally making phones would receive raw meat and then ship out their finished products to a commercial building that was a donut shop? No. But on the macro level you understood that resources need to go to specific refineries, which then go to industry zones based on distance, which then created abstract goods that needed to get to commercial zones while generating traffit.   Cities 2 has a detailed economy that tracks companies, specific industries and supply chains, supply and demand, production, ect... and... it doesn't work. Its a downgrade from 1.... because goods just teleport. You literally don't need to do anything. The game has all these bars and graphs that SAY 'X industry needs more ore products' but you don't actually need to ensure they can get them, and that makes sense because you can't actually set up things on that specific industry level anyway, so even if the system worked it would be a nightmare... but instead it just doesn't work at all and you can just toss anything anywhere at any time and basically not care because people and goods can teleport in a game primarily about connecting zones.  This isn't even going over bugs like with education. The core concepts of Cities 2 don't really make sense, which is why I am not surprised they are fake, but its baffling that in a game for simulation nerds they would ship something so transparently broken and non-functional and worse than 1... when they could have just made a simulation like 1's with maybe more detail on industries, better road making tools, and the new density system. Its just so confusing why the game is like this and why they just made something that doesn't work, and never likely will work.  Just play Cities 1."
149590916,english,0,949230,"Beware: traffic simulation, economy simulation, and sim life simulation are not designed to work together   Bought the game. Performance issues, not a big deal, it will get sorted. Playing along, about 15 hours in you realize the ""deep simulation"" is fake. Initially I realized there was a cargo bug. Nothing was getting exported via harbors or train or air cargo terminals. Although that itself was bugged, it revealed a HUGE issue that was put in by design. Turns out, the traffic simulation, the economy simulation, and the sim life simulation are all not connected to each other, which makes them all not really impressive at all. Sims have jobs, but don't actually have to go to work. (Same with school) Businesses need goods to operate, but don't actually need them to be exported or imported by the road system. You can have an industrial zone without any connections to the outside or the rest of your city and the economy side of things will work without issue via magical teleportation of goods and workers, in a game that is supposed to model traffic and ""create rush hours as your sims go about their lives"". Uhh, yeah, sure CO.   ""deep simulation"" they said over and over again.  I feel deceived on this one, and quite frustrated that I didn't realize it was all disconnected until past the refund period.  What the heck CO, I expected better than this.

If there's a way to pin them or anything please let me know, so I can give more credit to these guys:  ""They're still working on it."" -It's been a year after release. Stop giving companies grace for releasing broken products. YOU are the reason why they keep doing it.  ""Your PC is trash."" -First of all, doesn't at all address 6/8 points provided. And for the only two it MIGHT address... this is a commonly reported issue with the game. Talk about fallacy. - personally I just want to add, for comparison, that I'm running KCD2 or Cyberpunk smoothly on very high settings, whilst my recommended setings for CS2 are low/very low...  ""Why did you play it for 176 hours"" -90% of reviews are from people who barely get past the introduction and then provide poor unhelpful feedback that doesn't actually tell potential users anything of note.  ""Try not comparing a ten year old game's content compared to a one year old game"" - All about the value proposition. If the game doesn't adequately innovate mechanics, while also offering substantially less than a previous iteration - what is the point of getting the new game?  🔴 As for the things that I have ommited previously and that make me pissed off even more (even though the game is objectively getting better of course):  - I can't stress it out enough how terrible the pathfinding is.  - Poor graphics - I mean honestly, the game is newer, but is it really better looking? Grass textures are hideous, we have cartoonish cars, bland and simply sad colors and design of many buildings. CS2 was released the same year as Baldur’s Gate 3, Hogwarts Legacy, Alan Wake 2 or Lies of P. Would you have guessed it? Absolutely not, UI is better and it's easier to build things, but that only distracts from the simple fact that the game is ugly. Jesus, compare it to Manor Lords...  - Texture clipping, uneven road zoning, incomprehensible downcasts or road shading, misterious holes in the terrain adjacent to the structures, in other words dozens of minor errors that you spend a solid hour trying to fix because they sting your eyes and you'll go crazy until you fix them  - Lack of many tools that would mimic CS1's absolutely essential mods, like Traffic Manager or Intersection Marking Tool for example. Jesus, we still can create much better organised and more detailed intersections in CS1 than here. How they couldn't simply include at least the first 3 pages of most popular CS1 mods in the new game? The receipe for a success was so simple...  - Still no bikes, quays, just a few types of roads and intersections etc. - again, JESUS CHRIST IT'S A SEQUEL AND THEY CUT OUT SO MUCH CONTENT, THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.  - Related to the previous sub-item - promenades? PAID DLC. Almost any leisure and entertainment? PAID DLC. A few modern buildings? PAID DLC. Any region pack, after adding just a few most basic ones? PAID DLCs.  Disgusting."
180847633,english,0,949230,"City Skylines 2: A Huge Step Backward!!!  I’ve been a dedicated fan of City Skylines 1, pouring over 1,200 hours into that game and thoroughly enjoying every moment of city-building and management. Naturally, I was excited for City Skylines 2, and despite the initial mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance. After spending 250+ hours trying to immerse myself in this sequel, I can confidently say it’s been a MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Last night was the FINAL STRAW. I played for about 4 hours, carefully building my city and manually saving my progress multiple times to ensure nothing would be lost. Yet, during my final save, the game CRASHED. I didn't check the game archive at the time, because that's the kind of thing I'm USED TO. (Well done, City Skylines 2 team—you’ve successfully conditioned players to lower their expectations and tolerate glaring mistakes as if they were just part of the package.) When I reopened it today, all my save FILES were COMPLETELY GONE. Everything I worked on vanished as if I had never played at all.  For a game that demands long-term planning and hours of investment, technical issues like crashes and save file corruption are UNFORGIVABLE. This is basic functionality, and the fact that such issues persist after the game’s launch is UNACCEPTABLE. While City Skylines 1 felt polished and reliable, its sequel feels like a rushed, buggy mess that UNDERMINES the player’s TRUST and PATIENCE.  Unless the developers address these critical issues immediately, I CAN NOT RECOMMEND City Skylines 2 to anyone. It’s A HEARTBREAKING STEP BACKWARD from a franchise I ONCE LOVED."
154958535,english,0,949230,"The game needs to be better optimised and grinds to a halt when you get a few hundred thousand population.  So many people saying ""but CS1 took 7 years to get to where it is"".   Then I suggest you don't buy this until 2031."
150341735,english,0,949230,"Hmm this is going to be a tough review.  Much like everyone else I was very excited by the game when they announced and showed it.   When I first starting playing it I was enjoying my time with it but as the hours rolled by I think for me at least for now I can't recommend this game in its current state.  Man I wanted to truly like this game and sometimes I still do but well...  A decent amount of the core features are improved, The graphics, style, road placement and management and UI but at the same time there is also quite a lot missing, barely improved or outright worse or missing.   For starters the game is buggy, certain systems don't quite work or are planned out poorly especially the import export stuff. Then there is performance.   Some people may excuse it but I for one certainly can't. Having personally worked in the Unity ecosystem for 5+ years I can personally say they dropped the ball here. The graphics are great, Truly but the design and optimisation is going to take a LOT to fix an I feel bad for the engineers behind the scenes.   As a fan and customer I personally feel there no reason this game should barely be lucky to hit 30fps at low-medium on the best system costing thousands of dollars on the market especially when in a lot of areas the overall simulation while mostly better then CS1 its not that much better tbh.   This is made even worse when you realise most of the maps lack a LOT of details that were in the previous entry including grass of all things.  That is not okay and other details overall you will find its just missing or lacking overall,   The service vehicles don't have animations, there is less variety to all of the npcs and AI compared to the first game, Everything is sadly very static in regards to the ""world"". Most of the AI is just going from A to B and you can't even see the direct path they are taking unlike the first game which makes management of traffic more annoying then it needs to be especially for a sequel.  I think pets work now, Pretty sure I've seen dogs clocking in or walking home which can be more easily noticed once you hit 100k civs, which yknow honestly is just a hilarious bug.   I have three civs in my city which have been standing still since 20k and are now old people, One of them fucking died and whenever I want a laugh I just check up on them. It is another funny bug.  Pretty sure dogs at launch floated as well.  A lot of my very smooth roads have clipping issues into the void below on the sides of them an issue I don't remember being present in CS1.  I found it really tough to make my city look and feel unique outside of tree placement and road and terrain layouts because the detailing is a feature that not only hasn't improved from the first game but is seriously much worse then CS1 and overly lacking.   From a distance everyone's creations look amazing but when you zoom in aside from the awesome sense of scale which is a positive here in a massive way everything is the fucking same and it just sucks. Somehow less variety then CS1 at release side by side which makes no sense.  Like fences really? I can't even place fences? or quay walls which were in the first game, I can't modify existing details within buildings? or rocks and benches, I can follow an NPCs ""life path"" but god forbid I wanna actually make the houses they live in somewhat unique outside of naming with the same or similar tools the devs used to make them.   There is also very little in terms of variety for zone types which is kind of sucks considering this is suppose to be a sequel and placing specific zone types at times can be very frustrating, Like sometimes a certain house type will spawn for 99% of an area then for whatever reason wont for no real reason, Don't like it? Just remove the roads and start over and hope it works for the 2nd time or 3rd.   Also no idea why a plopable Rico isn't here in the base game. The assets are there, LET ME CHOOSE THEM PLEASE.    As time has gone on I have found myself finding more things that are were present in the first game but for whatever reason are not here or worse many things which are not improved at all.   For a sequel this really only has minimal major improvements of the first and the things which are improved they can't really make up for what is either worse or about the same as the first game..  Lane management is barely improved and its very frustrating to say the least combined with the traffic AI.  At low pop its not so bad and honestly seems alright and they even have working suspension a cool small detail however once you get high up there the simulation starts to break and brain of the civs just goes out of the window, Its like suddenly at 60k and above everyone decided booze were for everyone!   I spent more time stumped at how brain dead the AI overall can be before attempting at trying to fix it.   I had massive traffic jams stretching for miles with my interchanges barely being used. When I zoomed in they were all turning last second in multiple lanes, Some would do U-turns sometimes more then once and just cause chaos which for me at least is made even worse as IRL I'm learning to drive right now and the AI is making decisions I don't think I would ever make in a car even if I was 10 years old. Its insane!   Not to mention services, I have found the new feature of making them district restricted quite useful which is a positive but it still hasn't fixed the AI, A dead person is waiting for transport right across the road from the cemetery... WHAT? They are lucky that meteors can't be thrown willy nilly like in CS1.    I think this needed at least another year in the oven and if that wasn't an option early access at discount, Would of been better for the brand, devs and community.  That isn't the worst of it though. For me its how they have responded the community initially and how they made sure to tell the creators before release not to mention the performance and giving them weird restrictions. They knew exactly what they were doing and did it anyway. From the announcement of the hardware requirements going up hidden in a larger message to banning a long time community member for valid criticism.   I think in time they can turn it around, They did pretty good with CS1 and I think fully realised that games potential to the engine and design limits. Here I think the concept is good its just the execution. The bones are here for a great game. A lot of the core systems are in place begging to be polished or in quite a few cases outright fixed especially in regards to the overall simulation and I do love the art style more this time around although more variety is needed. What I have experienced so far overall I can see the potential down the line but for now it is just not here yet sadly.   The more I play this game the more depressed I feel about what could have been yknow?.   I love some parts of it but some other parts I just loathe and get annoyed. I'm currently trying to make a very realistic city and I'm running into so many design limitations with the current tool-set compared to the first game without mods it just kind of sucks.   I overall feel very mixed. At times it can be really great and chill, Other times it can be the opposite.  Hopefully they can improve the overall performance, Fix all the major bugs & at times broken simulation, Add in the missing features that were present at the very least from base game in CS1 at launch and MAYBE just maybe we will have a good start to the sequel for DLCS, Free patches & overhauls for many years to come.  If you want a proper sequel look elsewhere or come back in a year. Its a fine game overall even with the issues just don't go in expecting greatness, Some parts or better, Most are the same and some are worse then the first game.  It isn't worth the full price, Not even close, 40 AUD max, 60 AUD with the extra content. 5/10 (great potential) ~ SirJarko  Maybe in a year it will be worth it? Lets hope"
171930650,english,1,949230,"[h2] Intro [/h2] While I really enjoy the modern take on city building, Cities: Skylines 2 falls short in several areas I hoped would be improved from [i]CS:1[/i]. Although some features have been enhanced, many aspects feel very similar to the previous installment. Below are my thoughts, the good, the bad and the ugly!  [h3]Passing Thoughts[/h3] If you’re wondering whether it’s worth playing at the moment: [b]Yes and No.[/b] If you’re looking for a modern city builder and don’t mind some rough edges, then yes, it’s worth trying. However, if you prefer a more polished experience and want to wait until the issues are resolved, then it’s best to hold off.  [h3]The Good[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Engaging Sim Life:[/b] Just like in [i]Cities 1[/i], watching your sims go about their daily lives is a pleasure. The new feature allowing you to track a sim throughout its lifespan is a welcome addition. [*] [b]Improved Road System:[/b] The revamped road-building tool, including slip lanes for highways and dedicated turning lanes, is a significant improvement. While these features could have been added via mods in [i]Cities 1[/i], it’s great to see them included in the base game. [*] [b]Enhanced City Services:[/b] Power, water, and sewage now travel underground, eliminating the spaghetti-like pipes of the previous game. Additionally, there are more city service buildings available, offering varied services to your sims. [*] [b]Expandable Buildings:[/b] Many buildings now come with extra modules to increase their capacity. For instance, schools can be expanded with additional buildings, which reduces the need for numerous schools and service buildings as seen in [i]Cities 1[/i]. [*] [b]Mixed-Use Zoning:[/b] This feature, which I wished for in [i]Cities 1[/i], is now officially supported in [i]Cities 2[/i]. [/list]  [h3]The Bad[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Stagnant Gameplay:[/b] The game doesn’t evolve with city size. Managing a small city feels identical to managing a large one, unlike other city builders that offer varied and evolving gameplay. [*] [b]Lack of Challenges:[/b] There are no significant constraints or meaningful decisions. Problems are typically solved by simply ""building more,"" making the gameplay feel repetitive and flat. [*] [b]Limited Improvement:[/b] Although certain features, like highways, have seen improvements, fundamental issues with the grid layout and overall gameplay remain. These issues appear too deeply embedded to be resolved without a major overhaul in a future installment. [/list]  [h3]The Ugly[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Modding Platform Shift:[/b] Moving from the Steam Workshop to a third-party [i]'Paradox Mods'[/i] platform is a poor decision. Despite some solid features, this change detracts from the ease of modding that the first game provided. [*] [b]Poor Aesthetics: [/b]The grid-based design and focus on American urban sprawl lead to bland, unattractive cities. Specialized industry zones and modern industry representations are particularly weak, resulting in uninspired city layouts unless you sacrifice density. [*] [b]Bugs:[/b] The game still has several significant bugs, even after recent patches. For example, homeless people may remain indefinitely in your parks, which detracts from their intended use and overall enjoyment. Although the developers are aware of this issue, the lack of progress in addressing it is concerning. [/list]  [h3]Is It Worth It?[/h3] I wish Steam offered a middle-ground review option, rather than just ""Good"" or ""Bad."" While I enjoy the game, it remains quite rough around the edges. If you can tolerate some bugs and occasional issues, it might be worth trying. However, for most players, waiting [b]6 months+[/b] is probably the best option. Although I believe the game will have a long lifespan, I’m concerned that its poor initial reception might impact its future."
159365546,english,0,949230,Holding out on content so they can drain us of our money with DLC. The scheme is so played out now a days.
169445745,english,0,949230,"So this is from someone who played CS1 both modded and vanilla, with access to the DLCs (some features of which should have been in the base game, and others available as working mods from dedicated modders).  I would not recommend this game in it's current state, as it is buggy and does not work once the zombies take over (Note: This is not a zombie survival game).  UI			 	Roads will glitch when creating intersections, offramps, etc. (which is probably why they recently released a visual ""patch"" that allows adding pavement, etc.  	Your processing speed will slow down every time a zombie is created. How is a zombie created you may ask? Simple, if you purposely (or accidentally) destroy a building that houses any amount of people, those people will walk out to the street and just stand there, looking for a new place to live. But, since you most likely have an outside connection (*I even tried without an outside connection, still broken) those ""available"" homes will be taken by new people, and thus a zombie is created as ""Moving in"" or ""Idle"", if you destroyed a commercial zone, you create ""Shopping"" zombies. These citizens will stay in your city and slowly eat your processing power until your game speed of 3 is 10 minutes for an in game day to pass. Unsustainable, and game breaking (only the first of many game breaking issues with this game).  	Sometimes the weather works, and other times it does not and just ""glitches"" to the next day when it is sunny again.  Traffic			  	The AI doesn't respect lanes (no surprise that the AI still does not work when it comes to traffic), as they will turn in no turn lanes and do six to twelve point U-Turns wherever they can, multiple times. This is more common if you add or remove a road *anywhere* in your city, and it also happens when you add a sidewalk or crosswalk. This common task causes the AI to ""re-think"" and recalculate it's route, which causes them all to ""shift"" their routes.  		No individual lane control which means the dedicated turn lanes are determined by the angle of connecting the side roads, and a matter of one pixel will determine what the lanes do in response. Also, the traffic signals and signs are ""node"" specific, so there is no way to put a stop sign on just a sidestreet, etc., this was ""fixed"" in CS1 with mods.  	Cargo train stations are broken, they will not deliver goods between cargo stations, cargo airports, or cargo ships, and goods that are created locally from industry go no where, and commercial starts importing everything individually anyway, causing your industry to basically do nothing but create pollution.  	No weather related buildings (Heat, ice rink, sowplows, etc.), as they probably want money from a ""Snowfall"" like DLC from CS1	  Power/Water			  	Combustion banned zones should have increase power consumption, and there are no charging stations for EVs, only gas stations for fuel, ""Green Cities"" DLC?  	You can start a map importing power, but not water, so if you want to export water from the beginning tile you cannot (only for those that play with just 1 tile...)  	No water removing services, so enjoy those floods when you make a mistake.  Population			 		GAME BREAKING bug that I have no idea how it made it out of QA and passed Dev...zombie homeless just stand on the road taking up processing power, although some of them become homeless people that pay taxes and ""work"" but don't move into an available house or move out of your city (or actually ""go"" to work), and eventually become zombie robbers that kill your city...as mentioned earlier. This breaks your game in 1 way or another, I still don't understand how it made it out of Dev and QA and was released in this state. It is incredible how little it seems CO/Paradox cares anymore... 			 Healthcare			 	No deathcare	or childcare, probably want money from a ""Sunset Harbor""	like DLC from CS1  	The aforementioned zombies still negatively contribute to the overall health of the city, also killing your city, and when they get sick or die, healthcare and deathcare cannot ""pick"" them up so you get stuck with symbols flashing on your screen on of sick and dead homeless.  School			  	There are no preschools (or daycare) as mentioned earlier.  	No law school or dorms, probably want money from a ""Campus Life"" like DLC from CS1.  	More people ""stuck"" in building then ""eligible"" to be there, zombies live in schools and other buildings so even if a certain amount of people are eligible to go to school, they can't because every school is completely filled, until you have a map that is just elementary schools.  	Educated sims still become Robbers at an incredible rate, and soon you will have a city of Well-Educated Homeless Robbers who are Happy and Wealthy. Good luck getting rid of them, no amount of taxes or lack of city services will deter them.  Police 			 	Well, the police are currently broken as they cannot ""arrest"" homeless robbers, and since there is no way to control patrolling or set up stationary ""standing"" locations for police vehicles, 3 police cars will drive around chasing 1000 criminals in a town of 500 people, causing the crime to kill the city. At least my police helicopter flies 10 feet south above my river on it's routine patrol, just to turn around and land. Also fun to watch my 3 police cars drive into a crime scene, look at the robber (or group of robbers as the AI just stand there) and then drive away without making an arrest. 		 Fire			  	A waste of money being ""on"" all the time as they don't help with traffic accidents or house-calls for EMS, or hospital, etc. Can just turn it on when a disaster strikes or a fire starts, but other than that it is super expensive to do very little. 			 Parks			  	No ""Parklife"" benefits, i.e parks built on sidewalks, etc. Also, no amusement parks, zoos, aquariums, etc. because, of course, they probably want money from a ""Parklife"" like DLC from CS1.  	No ""professional"" sports	 stadiums (which I believe was actually free from ""Sports Venue"" DLC)  	Trees are easier to plant, but can no longer ""clean"" polluted ground, and do very little, if anything, in stopping noise pollution.  Disaster			  	When an area floods, there is no way to remove the water without destroying buildings and using landscaping tools to ""push"" the water back. Cars will just drive through it, zoneable buildings will ""build"" underwater staying in a permanent destroyed state, and other buildings will just stop working unless you notice the water surrounding it.		  	Only tornadoes and forest fires (every 10 minutes or so, without fail), and no disaster routes or control of the shelters that are available, probably  because they want money from a ""Natural Disasters"" like DLC from CS1.	 			 Zones			  	No real district control, as there are laughable amount of polices (that do very little, imo).  	No historical buildings (no way to ""save"" a building model you like to preserve it)  	No hotels/motel/gas station manual control, even though it is purposely built into the Economy 2.0, again things that were basic in the ""After-Dark"" (Leisure and Tourist spec, etc.), ""Hotels & Retreats"" and ""Green Cities"" DLCs.	  	No ""industry zones"" which means no control of what ""companies"" move in, even though this is a big deal in Economy 2.0.  No way in vanilla to even see company info.  	No standalone warehouses or industry/company specific warehouse control to pick from, again because ""Industries"" DLC	made this available in CS1, another paid DLC.  	Zoning ""too much"" will create broken empty buildings, common in industry creating ""warehouse"" UI models, but no company will ever move in, or houses that remain empty even though homeless people are looking to move into a house (or college kids moving out of their parent's house live in a park or become a zombie instead of moving into one of these buildings), or you will get 5 of the same company in a row (or 5 gas stations, albeit different companies) in a row, or very close to each other."
178543649,english,0,949230,"I wanted to like CS2, but I can’t recommend it. The base game is boring, and you need mods to make it interesting and to fix basic glitches. Unfortunately, that led to my first-ever malware after 28 years of PC gaming, all because CS2 lacks basic protections—like two-factor authentication for mod uploads. Thankfully, the malware seems to only target crypto, which I stay away from, but that risk is too big to ignore. I am done with this game, and don't know if I will be back."
165142706,english,0,949230,"I have been waiting for some update to past before writing a review for C:S2.  If you want a city builder and nothing more, go for the original; If you want to build your own city with style, go for the original with dlc; If you want realistic simulation, go for the original with mods until your cpu is cooked; If you want to use the game as a sand box and go for pure beauty, go for the original with asset until your gpu is cooked; If you want to use mod and asset, go for the original which has !! STEAM WORKSHOP BUILD-IN !!, no 3rd party bs;  YES THEY EVEN MAKE THE WORKSHOP A THIRD PARTY THING SO NO MORE EASY CLICK FOR MODDING.  This does NOT worth even HALF of its price in current stage."
161134221,english,0,949230,"Half a year has passed since the game's release.  I've been patiently hoping Colossal would fix their game, and didn't request a refund when I had the chance. That was a mistake. Several months in, they still haven't fixed glaring optimization issues, or their simulation engine. Opening the game to see 20 fps in the main menu or on an entirely empty map on 3080ti was a very special experience.  Since then, in response to well-deserved constructive criticism regarding the game, the developer just showed their belligerence and tried to wrap it as ""playerbase's toxicity"" instead of fixing their barely functioning game, or coming up with excuses in line with ""if you want better performance our game might not be for you"".  Stay away from this game, it was released in an alpha state and has not been fixed ever since. Instead, their resources went towards paid DLC content."
158262106,english,0,949230,"I’ve liked playing Cities: Skylines 2 so far. It’s definitely an enjoyable game, with a lot of promise. That being said, the game does not get any points for being “enjoyable” and having promise. The bar was much, much higher for this game  While it’s not fair to expect CS2 to be as feature rich and polished as CS1 is, so close to launch - it is fair to expect it to be fully functional to the extend we were promised from marketing.  I can forgive the lack of assets. I can forgive the bugs. I can forgive that we were told that the game would initially launch without mod support and that mods would no longer be run through the Steam workshop.   But more than 3 months after release, Colossal Order has not been able to deliver timely updates to fix numerous bugs, let alone deliver features that they promised. Mod support and console release keeps getting delayed. Performance has been getting better but it is still an incredibly demanding game for what it is.   In 2023 and now 2024, the sad reality which I’ve come to accept, is that games will be released with bugs - lots of bugs. What is completely inexcusable is that they are no longer pushing updates for bug fixes/patches independently from DLC launches. Major patches will now be released alongside paid content.   In 2 years I’m sure this game will be better.  But CO deserves a negative review until then; this game should be marked as early access and its price should reflect that. Do not buy this game until then. You’ll have a better experience buying CS1 + DLC and modding it to your liking."
154112824,english,0,949230,"The potential is there but this game is in beta at best. I put hundreds of hours into the original CS and this game is awful in comparison. After 70 hours of trying to pull off builds, everything is bugged, nothing works as it should, and there's just no fun to be had.   Not only are we paying to beta test this for you, you're releasing DLC instead of fixing this buggy mess? Shame on you for the scammy product, shame on me for buying the ultimate edition.  I wrote the above review in December 2023. It is now 2025 and the game still feels like a buggy beta but it is almost playable. I guess I'll check in in another year."
173953297,english,0,949230,"so after  over 400 hours, and 50 hours since last update, i'm furious with this game. i've never seen so many different unrelated glitches in one game. i never leave reviews, but i had to get this off my chest. the longer you play on the same map, the more glitches appear, which is so frustrating, i spend hours and hours working on one single city, and by the time i get to a population of 100k, the entire city is so broken it becomes unplayable. things that were working fine when i started a map, start breaking, the land itself starts glitching, a wall of dirt will appear around your city, the buildings wont level up. the ocean level will magically jump 10 feet, flooding anything close to the water. when i say its a broken game i mean its broken."
158923154,english,0,949230,"Over 500 hours I've played this game and I'm done. Here's the gist:  [list] [*] [b]The amount of assets is dismal.[/b] Every residential house looks the same and there's like three variants. Every other commercial building is a drab gas station. Every high-density office building looks like a 20-story, gray, concrete masonry column of sadness. So gloomy. So dull. [*] [b]The lack of assets creates a horribly bland experience.[/b] It's not enjoyable/realistic in a city of 100K population to have three different house models and 100 office buildings that look like identical gray Lego bricks. [*] [b]The game is unplayable over 100K population.[/b] Speaking of large cities, the gameplay and graphics come to a excruciating crawl once a city's population nears 100K. 5800X3D processor, 128 GB memory, and a 4080 card? Doesn't matter. Slo-mo everything. And that's with extensive ""performance enhancement tweaking"" of the settings. [*] [b]Industry doesn't matter.[/b] Importing too much convenience food? Well too bad because building more industry to produce it locally will only spawn another hundred stone mills so you'll have plenty of rocks being produced. Oh and deleting and respawning industry buildings does nothing except create more rock shops. Maybe after two hundred deletions you [i]may[/i] get a timber plant. [*] [b]What about industry taxes?[/b] Best to not mess with these. Going to 0% or even subsidizing industries to encourage production makes no difference. Also, random industries will create literally hundreds of millions in revenue or cause a deficit in the hundreds of millions unless the tax rate is set to 0%. [*] [b]Ok just import/export using cargo then.[/b] Not a chance in heck. Traffic gets so backed up at train/sea/air cargo stations that trucks despawn and nothing is picked up/delivered. Unless you build ten cargo stations across your city. [*] [b]But, just like in real life cargo stations will hoard local and outgoing mail, right?[/b] This doesn't happen in real life but in CS:2 it does. Once a cargo station of any type is built it will hoard all your city's mail rendering post offices useless as no mail trucks ever pickup mail from the cargo stations. [*] [b]Schools[/b] Elementaries are hugely comical in size. No one goes to high school. Everyone goes to college. [*] [b]Parks[/b] No one goes to parks except the homeless who setup camp there. And forget about building large, beautiful parks like in CS:1's Parks DLC because that was left out for some reason and we were given boring, generic parks. [*] [b]The road tools are nice.[/b] [/list]  3/10  Go back to CS:1  EDIT: I just can't quit you, C:S2"
162773838,english,0,949230,"TLDR: Broken mess of a game.  Simulation is broken. Radio stations are awful. Performance sucks. Rolling out DLC without fixing the game. Play CS1 instead, don't buy this travesty."
190371276,english,0,949230,"This game is still a [b] disaster [/b] after a year and a half, If you're interested, it's March 2025, the game is still not optimized, lags are starting at 40k population AI is dumb, despite the promises of the developers, they will never find the best route to avoid traffic jams. The game is still not optimized. A broken economy. Broken death system, bodies will always grow, hearse will never be used at 100% Because of the stupid AI, emergency services will not be able to reach their destination in time, they will always take the longest route. Strange responses from a community manager who in August 2023 said, Don't criticize our developers and don't be toxic, otherwise we will stop answer you.

The mod community is dead, no beautiful buildings that we had in CS 1, no fixes to AI from modders ~NOTHING~ Less than a year later after ""realease"" , Paradox tried to sell the DLC, but failed.

156075470,english,0,949230,"To be upfront, I have only reviewed this game now due to their first press release of the year. I have complaints with the game  in general itself among other things, but the biggest thing I cannot excuse is how the devs repaid their loyal customers. CS1 was a near masterpiece and outside of good game development, the devs were loyal and friendly to their customers. CS was the only game I can think of for a long time where buying DLC, while costly at times, was hardly a second thought because it both added content and was repayment for how much respect we as customers had for them.  CS2 totally flatfaced most of us. I bought CS2 not too early after release and expected what something between what was written about it and what I saw in CS1. I quit playing 10 minutes in when my graphics were all over the place, didn't work half the time, and when they did I felt like they stepped down considerably from CS1. After a number of updates I played again after hearing it's better quality wise. My honest opinion on CS2 is it's not only unfinished in many areas, but in places the game has taken a one step forward, two steps back approach. Like special industrial zones changing and how they did was nice, but it felt off the mark in other places like with how unnatural the zones are and how not many people can even occupy that site as a job. And of course CS is a traffic heavy game, but CS2 traffic AI is beyond broken as even with perfect road design you will always see cars paralyzed by excessive yielding and cars wanting to turn into a turning lane so they can turn out of it at the next traffic light - and god help you if you don't yield to their wanton desires.  Overall there's a lot of stuff that should be in the game that isn't, stuff from the old game that should be (like what happened to designing intersections with stop signs?!) in the game, and buggy issues that have yet to be fixed. And with a game so close to modders, you'd think day one there'd be mod support. There are mods right now that could be here on Steam, that have fixed a lot of the issues mentioned, but aren't here because the devs have spent their time doing whatever it is.  At the end of the day I can at least move on and forgive knowing these devs since their track record with CS1 was great. But since CS2 the devs have seriously not only let down their fans but outright betrayed them. And now they've gone full out blame-game by accusing the fans - their loyal customers - of being toxic. They suggest just making honest critiques and making suggestions but then ban or delete anyone who makes them in the game's related forums for being toxic. I was originally waiting to see if they would fix more with the game before I left a review of any kind, but after seeing this latest toxicity accusation against us, I decided to join others who've left negative reviews in order to show the devs we don't appreciate being missled and gaslit about a game they should have had no issue releasing in the first place. I will only swap my recommendation if they apologize and fix the game seriously from now on. Until then I will continue to play since I have the game, but I will not buy anything else from this devs like DLC until they change their ways."
174951039,english,0,949230,"[b]I wouldn't say ""don't buy this game"": I just wish I hadn't bought it so that I could still enjoy CS1.[/b]  It's been a year since the turbulent release and except for resolved the critical bugs, the game is still not on-par compared to the first game's quality and content.  With regular crashes-to-desktops and game-simulation speed grinding down to a halt after 150K-200K population;   [b]there is no point in being creative[/b] (you're already unable to, since there isn't much content to suit your narrative yet) [b]there is no point in being expansive[/b] (because after some point, each simulation minute takes five minutes) [b]there is no point in discovering[/b] (because you cannot spend your skill points without an either-or question, it's never both unless you play with 'everything unlocked')  There [u]are[/u] improvements to the first game, such as mixed-zoning and road-building --which I'm also angry about because now I can't go back to the first game after getting used to the comfort of these newer mechanics.

177024877,english,0,949230,"One year later and the game is still missing integral features that were literally promised in the promotional material. The economy still doesn't actually function, meaning you will not see goods from your industries travel across your town; everything just teleports as needed.  Your finances make no sense because somehow you just get more money but cannot figure out where it is coming from, resulting in there being no way to fail. It's also great to see their CEO literally _lie_ about features of the game before release, and then _blame the customers_ when the reception to their half-baked pile of shit is poor.  This game is not only bad, it's literal consumer fraud. Colossal Order have burned to ashes whatever positive sentiment I once held for them."
149097733,english,0,949230,"REVIEW UPDATE: I am now at 85 hours. After learning the mechanics of how the simulations work, I will admit my original review is influenced by not fully understanding some mechanics. For instance, the constant low density residential demand.  Aside from bugs rendering whole chunks of the game broken, such as trade and garbage bugs, after 85 hours the biggest issues I have with this game are two-fold: 1. An extreme lack of content. Building (and farm) diversity is extremely lacking. I suspect content will be DLC'ed to hell, which I strongly oppose Paradox's DLC strategy of removing content to the bare bones and then selling it to players later.  2. Design decisions that just simply don't work, or don't make sense. For instance, pegging ""wealth"" to ""education level"". Wealth should be pegged to career instead. How off map city services function also doesn't really work. They work against the principle of building a healthy, functioning city. If you lack a service, it doesn't negatively impact your game, except that sims have a little less wealth as they pay for the off map service. But that's easily countered by cheaper taxes. Standard genre features like the RCI meter work differently to all previous city builders. Instead of showing what to build for a healthy city, CS2 RCI meter shows what the city wants (which most likely doesn't result in a healthy city). Design changes away from genre standards are fine, just make sure to include in game ways to let the player know what the change is from the genre standard.  Anyways, after 85 hours my final conclusion stands. I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2. Aside from performance and bugs, the game has very little content, and has design decisions that don't work, or don't make sense.  ---- ORIGINAL REVIEW: I tried to like CS2, I really did. I can ignore the performance issues and bugs, as these are things I see being fixed over the short term with some patches in optimisation. However, there are much bigger issues that you need to be aware of. The numerous simulations in the game have such foundational flaws in them, that I believe this game is the most fake city builder of them all.  This game is marketed as ""the most realistic city builder ever"", with multiple levels of simulation in the city, sims, economy, services, and traffic. Unfortunately, there are huge flaws in each are of the simulation.  After 20+ hours playing, aside from the known performance problems (which I've mitigated by running the game at lower gfx than I should be), these are the biggest issues I see:  - The economy is broken. Goods in your city aren't actually traded. Import/export don't actually do anything, so trucks deliver goods to your stores and train stations, ports, and airports, but the transportation networks never pick it up to deliver off map. Industry, commercial and residential don't use your produced goods. There is no cargo traffic in your city, because there is no simulation of producing goods, transporting them to your shops, and then sims buying those goods. It's all completely fake. Colossal Order have confirmed this on Paradox forums.  - The progression system is broken, just place a tourist trap and bulldoze it, repeat over and over. Level 20 without doing anything. Progression is not linked to population, just ""XP"" gained from placing stuff. Thing is, it doesn't remove the XP if you bulldoze straight away. As a result you can have a ""Flourishing Metropolis"" with 50 people. Each main step should have a population limit. IE: town 10k, city 50k, metropolis 100k or something.  - Most people don't actually go to work, kids don't go to school, people don't shop. You can track individual sims. When you follow them, they actually don't go to work. They will get in their cars, or walk to the tram or whatever, jump on, and then do a circuit back home. Or they'll arrive at work and get straight back onto transport again to come home. Kids do not leave the house. They will stay in their homes, not going to school. The whole rush hour thing is a joke. Basically, the sims simulation is..... fake. And this is the big ticket item that this game is sold on. A simulation of each individual sim, going about their world, doing what the do. Living, growing, prospering, dieing. All faked.  - The city only ever demands low density housing, never anything else. City of 50k, with very little office demand. Always, low density residential will be 100% demand. You can even buy 20 tiles, do a massive grid of low density residential, it'll all pop into existence and demand will still be 100%.  - You don't need to build any city services, it all comes in really cheaply from off map. It's cheaper to import all services, than to build the services yourself and pay for maintenance. The only exception seems to be power and water. You can export power and water for enormous profits.  - Maintenance and expansion is not balanced at all. For some buildings it's cheaper per unit to build a new one, and some are cheaper to just expand. For instance water pump: $10,000 to build 100,000 unit pump, and $7,000 to expand one an extra 50,000 units. Cheaper to make a new one there.  - The traffic AI is just absolutely stupid and retarded. I couldn't think the traffic AI could be worse than CS1, but they actually managed to do it. Cars will do u-turns in the middle of a highway. Cars will stop in the middle of the road, jump across 3 lanes causing a big traffic jam, just to reach a left-hand turn they go straight through instead. Opposing carriage turns (ie: right from left side drive, left from right side drive) will not wait till the approaching through traffic is clear. They will turn like it's the middle of Delhi and cause a huge accident or traffic jam.  - The economy is extremely frustrating. There are no small-town service buildings, so to cater for your citizen demands you need to build service buildings priced for cities much larger than what you have. This results in grinding your city's economy into the ground. The only way around this is to largely ignore city services until at least 25k population when your tax revenue is starting to be enough to pay for these demanded services. All the while the annoying bird, building icons, and radio announcements will continue harping on about all these citizen demands. On the flip side, electricity and water exports are priced so out of balance, that building a few extra coal power plants and water pumps, and exporting every single piece of it, will have you swimming in money.  - The whole off map servicing of your citizens is quite simply extremely flawed at it's foundations. When you utilise off map services, the price of those services do not adjust to cater for the simple economic principle of supply and demand. You can pump as much electricity to the off map as you can, and the game will continue to give you the same high price for each MWh. Same with importing off map services. Using off map fire services will remain the extremely cheap price no matter how many fires they have to come and put out.  - The garbage system is totally cactus. Your incinerators will go get garbage from off map to burn, rather than burning your own. Your landfill fills up, your buildings fill up, and stupidly off map garbage trucks come and get your rubbish. The only way to get around this is to build huge landfills, and once they are full just bulldoze it. Poof, all garbage gone. Since incinerators don't collect your garbage from landfills, as it's cheaper for them to drive off map and get it there, it's the only way to process landfill.  TL:DR - Optimisation issues aside, there are MAJOR flaws in each of the game's simulations. The entire game presents a facade, layered on top of fancy marketing speak. I think in reality, this game is the most fake city builder out of any of the top-tier city builders in the 30+ years I've been playing city builders. Ultimately, I do not see how Colossal Order/Paradox proceed from here."
178876442,english,0,949230,CS2 has been out for over a year what we learned:  It's in an incomplete state. the switch from steam workshop to Paradox mods has caused a crypto wallet stealing virus to be widely spread. They are sort of listening to fans but are ignoring a ton of community concerns and requests The other reviews cover the rest of the pros and cons of this game.
161493745,english,0,949230,Still in beta state 6 months after the release but start selling empty DLCs 🤡
161524576,english,0,949230,"I loved Cities 1, so I instantly pre-ordered Deluxe edition of Cities 2. And I was scammed! :-(  There is no proper simulation/economics in the game. There is nothing to do actually.  Your late game is looking at these messages: - NO CUSTOMERS - HIGH RENTS  But WHY? -> there are not proper stats, information, nothing to fix it.  There are zero challenges with the traffic.  Oh, there is finally a DLC, Beach Properties - like extra assets but you don't have beaches in the game.  I was defending Colossal Order for a long time but releasing the empty DLC, counting on modders to fix the game.  SHAME ON YOU!"
183690450,english,0,949230,"Well, after almost 100 Hours, guess it's Review time...  First, I bought the Ultimate Edition when the game came out, over a year ago by now...in hindsight I shouldn't have done that. But as we all know, hindsight is 20/20…  The Release was awful, dare I say, one of the worst states a game came out I have every personally seen. This game should have NEVER been released in the form it was. I generally like Paradox, I played a lot of their games, some way too much. Same with Colossal, I have over 500 Hours in Cities Skylines 1, but the way this was released, to be frank, I should have refunded it.  Even though all this was bad, you could say terrible, at least Colossal Order communicated with the community, though to be clear, it doesn't change the fact that this should have never been sold as a full price game, because the initial release was more like an alpha test.  I checked every time there was an update and yes they did their best to update it as fast as possible, fixing bugs, improving performance. After 1 or 2 months or so it was playable, performance wise, but the economy was kind of broken.  After a while I lost interest in the game, without modding, the game was dead for me, a waste of €90.  I checked again when FINALLY modding came, Paradox's own ""Workshop"" came, Paradox Mods for CS2. But finding out that ""for now"" we will only have code mods, so no new Buildings made by the community to enhance the game to where CS1 was at that time, was a bummer. In hopes that that would come soon, I gave it a chance. But soon was not so soon...  I lost Interest again and didn't play the game for half a year. To this day, 25th, December 2024, we still don't have close to what came for CS1 over the years. Now one could say with the region packs there is something and I want to thank all the people involved in those for what they made. But why don't we have building mods the way we had them in CS1?  To be frank, I lost hope for this game, I wish this will become what CS1 became, but my gut feeling is that this game is more or less written off as a loss, never to be finished the way it was meant to be in the devs minds. I wish, and I want to be wrong about that. But my gut tells me otherwise    And that's why, for me, for now, I can't recommend buying this game. After over a Year, it is still in a State that feel horrible and I personally have to say, from now on I will be careful with buying Ultimate Editions of games from Paradox, before CS2 they had that trust, that many others lost already, with this they lost that. What a disappointment.   If any of the developers read this. I am sorry, but you probably know as much, if not better, that this should have never been released the way it was. I personally, as a customer, rather wait longer for a product and get a product that is in good shape, then getting what we got. To compare it with something. This release felt like I just bought a car, without Engine, with the promise that that will be delivered soon, and it was just not in stock. Without a steering Wheel and doors."
177184040,english,1,949230,"If you've never played a Cities game play CS1, then with DLC, then with mods first. Come to this if you're a fan of that and want a graphical update, economy, and gameplay change. However, despite this CS1 will always be better for a long time. That is solely because of the amount of time updates, DLC, and mods have flooded into the community. Each fix of CS2 is a step towards the right direction but it doesn't overshadow the fact that the launch was very disappointing. It should never be standard in the industry.   Performance and stability has improved since launch for me. Pretty playable and the essential mods from CS1 are here. It's also a very pretty game but CS2 is not without its flaws including some occasional crashes. Consistent updates will help but buyers beware. This game is a slow burn towards what it can become.  Overall I would say this is a cautiously positive 6/10"
190555071,english,0,949230,Love the fact i Spent over 100 dollars on a single video game to make sure i'd receive all post launch content. Just to be laughed at and asked to spend another 35 dollars not even a year an a half later. Deplorable greed is going to be the downfall of this glorified city painter. Id recommend just play SIM city. Im done supporting this trash company.
166501755,english,0,949230,"I have almost 1200 hours in CS1. I bought it the day it came out and played on and off religiously for almost 10 years. Yes, it was nearly the perfect city builder at launch and was only consistently made better by the modding community.  I was absolute overjoyed when I saw the release trailer for CS2, so much so I took a vacation day so I would be able to dedicate the entire day to playing it when it launched.  Leading up to launch day I ignored the early access reviews and kept telling myself its just nonsense. Launch day comes and I was heartbroken. Poorly optimized, no mod support, no map editor, almost no changes that were promised were working, and the game was nearly unplayable due to crashing and freezing. I still held off on giving a poor review.  8 months later I see that mod support and map editing are in beta, and that the game has been optimized better. I re-download the game and hop in and things look promising. Load into a new game and the moment i go to lay my first road the game crashes. Just completely disappears off my screen. Load back in, new map downloaded from the mod store and it loads in completely dark, no UI anywhere and I couldnt even exit the game because the escape key wouldnt open the menu.  Alt+F4 and uninstalled again. I have 1.1 hours in this game and about 45 minutes of that was browsing the mod store. I can't even being to explain how disappointed and saddened i am over this. I have less and less time to dedicate to gaming now that i am approaching my 40s and CS was ALWAYS the game i could hop into and know i could relax and enjoy. It seems i cant even lay a single road almost a year into launch for a game i paid full price for.  Shame on Colossal Order, i am so disappointed."
191009754,english,0,949230,"I've waited a long time to write this maybe because, while I don't have a full understanding how game development works, I do appreciate the time it takes to produce something like this. But I think I'm at the point where I'm done. I pre-purchased the base edition and ""played"" during launch week, if you want to call it that. I completely understood launch issues and even the fact, many weeks afterward, that they were rushed to get this game out. By this point, not much has changed. I have 2 main issues that I just can't get over.  1. I realize this an extreme personal preference but the idea that we cannot get more pre-made intersection and interchange assets, even if by community modders, kills a lot of enjoyment for me. Call it lack of creativity or intelligence, but I'd rather worry about the layout of the city and not trying to find ways to make a kindergarten level highway interchange for myself. Something the first game did wonderfully in my view.   2. This is much more general of a complaint that my first issue kinda ties into. I keep asking myself, ""What have I gained by playing Cities Skylines 2 instead of the first game?"" Some people would have to point this out to me because, with my play-style, I can't think of much. Defiantly not enough to warrant the money, time, and patience I've put into this game.  I have come to the conclusion that I am no longer going to put any more hope into this game. I feel I've waited long enough and with all respect to the devs, I will uninstall this one and just go back to the first one. Maybe even continue to buy DLC's for it. But I refuse to put anymore faith in a game that is, essentially, a worse quality version of it's previous game. I would honestly love a refund for this game. I would maybe even use the refund to put back into DLC's for the first Cities. But fat chance of that by now.   I want to make it clear that I've been on steam for close to 15 years and I've rarely....RARELY left a bad review. Even when a game was absolute garbage. I would just uninstall and chalk it up as a loss. But this is different. I vividly remember when the first Cities came out and it was a godsend. Sim City had gone so far downhill that I commented to my wife, ""This is what the new Sim City should have been!"" Unfortunately, it only took Cities one game cycle for it to fall into the same hole. One could ask, ""What happened?"" Or  worse off, ""What's happening,"" since it hasn't gotten much past the point of, ""At least it runs...kind of.""  Conclusion, and it saddens my heart to say it, but if you're considering buying this game...just don't. Not even on sale. Buy the first one and save yourself the trouble and actually have some fun."
176134262,english,0,949230,"Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game at the moment (3/10). After 200 hours of trying to enjoy it, I’ve been disappointed by the lack of honesty from the developers. This version of the game is, at best, in a beta stage and feels like an insult to the many fans of the first game. Numerous features are missing, and we all know why: they’ll be sold as DLC, just to squeeze more money out of us.  Update January 16: The free addition of Creator Packs brings renewed appeal to the game and enhances diversity in city creation. This is a step in the right direction, but there is still much to be done."
156564590,english,0,949230,"[b]Cities Skylines II[/b] was a very long-awaited sequel to the most famous [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/]Cities Skylines I[/url].  [h1]What went wrong?[/h1]  Turns out - [u]Everything[/u] Let's go over some simpler aspects of why this game failed at launch.  [olist] [*]Having multiple ""Editions"" of the base game. Now, of course, I am not saying that this is a bad thing. If one really wants to support his favorite developer - he can freely do so, by buying a higher ""Edition"" of a game. The problem came with the rewards - [b]At the time of writing this review, people that have ordered said ""Editions"", have NOT yet received their rewards.[/b] Whenever you offer your game for multiple prices, people have a set [u]expectation[/u] that you, as a developer, must match. This was not shown by Colossal Order whatsoever.  [*]The game was announced in the March, and released in [b]October[/b] of the same year. Of course, some game companies tend to work on sequels undercover, and announce them only after they deem it ""up to their standards"". [i]This was not the case for Cities Skylines II.[/i] At launch - it was [b]VERY, and I mean VERY[/b] ""optimised"". I am gaming on 64GB of RAM and a 3070 Alongside a Intel i7-10700k, which is a pretty solid build. Result? Average of about 20-30 FPS on Medium graphic settings on a settlement with about 15k people. To also add salt on to the wound - game would frequently crash. I am talking consistent crashes every 15-20 minutes.  [*]Not being able to receive backlash for a very bad release of the game. If you were like most, and were of course, not satisfied with the release of the game in such a state, you would try to go and say it on the forums, write reviews, and ask developers questions as to how the fuck it is possible to release this junk. What you receive? A mute. Maybe a temporary ban for the time being for ""Harassing"" the developers. Now, I understand we are human, and being human means making mistakes. BUT WHAT THE FUCK?! You release a very, [b]VERY[/b] underbaked game, and then you decide to call everyone who doesn't like this garbage as ""Harassers"" and ""Demoralisers"".  [*]Mods. Or - lack thereof. Recently read a post from OC. It's the 9th OC post, and inside, and I quote -  [quote=Colossal Order Ltd.]Public Beta version of code modding and Paradox Mods will be available in the live build by the end of March. Public Beta version of Map editing available in the live build together with code modding or soon after. Public Beta version of Asset editing to be announced, only after the technical issues are sorted can we roll out the tool.[/quote] ... So, let me get this straight. You release a half-baked game ... With no modding support ... Until a year later ...? And of course, people got mad. Rightfully so.  [*]Problems. Bugs. And many core features missing. Of course, of course! What did you expect?? A Paradox game having a good launch?! Phaha! Don't make me laugh, both of us know that this will persist, until Colossal Order will start making [b]DLC's[/b], which not only paywall the original core features, but also do the damned bug fixes. [/olist]  [h1]Final Review[/h1]  At the state the game is currently - I doubt it is worth your time. You could spend the time you have on something more useful, or a game that is more fun. If you [b]really[/b] enjoy city-builders, and want to do something in them, then you can buy this game.  My review? About [i]3.5 out of 10[/i]. If you want to buy it, wait for a sale.

188885073,english,0,949230,"After eagerly anticipating the sequel to one of my favorite city builders, Cities Skylines 2 has been nothing but a disappointment. I pre-ordered the maximum version, investing significantly in what I hoped would be an amazing follow-up, but my excitement quickly turned to frustration.  The gameplay and economy have been simplified to the point of being uninteresting. Where the original game offered depth and strategic challenge, the sequel presents shallow mechanics that fail to engage long-term players. Most frustrating is that the DLC strategy focuses entirely on cosmetic additions rather than expanding gameplay with meaningful functional elements.   Also game not received the Ukrainian language support, which feels like an oversight given the global nature of the player base.  Technical issues have plagued the game since launch, with numerous bugs remaining unfixed for over a year. The developers seem more interested in pushing out visual DLC than addressing these fundamental problems.  The final straw came when the game crashed during a save operation. Upon restarting, I discovered all my save files were corrupted and completely unrecoverable - dozens of hours of careful city planning and building completely erased in an instant. This level of instability is simply unacceptable for a full-priced game with paid DLC.  I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2 in its current state, especially to fans of the original. Wait for significant patches or deep discounts before considering this disappointing sequel."
178222959,english,0,949230,"Cities: Skylines II is a promising game that has made significant improvements since its launch. However, it still falls short of its predecessor and the lofty expectations set by its developers.  The recent security breach, where malicious code was uploaded through the mod system, is a major setback. This incident highlights a serious lack of oversight and raises concerns about the developers' competence.  Given these issues, I have decided to uninstall the game. It's unfortunate to see such a potentially great game tarnished by poor development choices and security lapses."
163583527,english,0,949230,"I loved CS 1. For those of us who are not artistically inclined it provided a perfect sandbox to design & create. Truly, if you could imagine it, you could create it. I have (almost) as much fun ""shopping"" for mods as running the simulation (yes, unlike CS 2, CS 1 tries to be a simulation). It was the most unique and satisfying computer game (with the possible exception of KSP) I ever experienced.  But it is time to face facts: CS 2 will NEVER be superior to CS 1. Why?  First, it is not a true attempt at a simulation. The idea that if you cant supply your denizens that magic, invisible Amazon trucks will simple deliver what is needed is just an example. I'm sure there are other examples, but I have better things to do than pick apart the obviously rushed and half-baked work the designers did. What's the challenge of making a city both functional and beautiful if the simulation doesn't care?  Second, this is an UGLY game. The muted colors, building designs, etc. are drab. The resource buildings (how farms and mines are laid) are downright hideous. No corn, wheat or barley fields laid out in a nice checkerboard like (with mods) you get in CS 1, but blobby patches with haphazard buildings strewn all over the place. Did these guys even bother to look at pictures of farms in Europe or the US?  Third: Modding. It should have been a red alarm bell when modding was closed off behind the companies own platform. There really is only one reason for it. They are going to monetize the shit out of this product, and any modders (who are truly the simulation's heroes: King Leno et. al., you are tops!) are going to be frozen out. ""Oh, you have created 12 different palm trees? Well forget it. We are going to give them 4....and make 'em pay."" This will not change. They well make sure that ANY asset mod better than what they want to push down your gullet never sees the light of day. You stick with this simulation, hold on to your wallet, it's going to be a bumpy ride.  The thing is, it all could have been so different. They could have easily put this thing together by bringing in the modders, paying for the IP they put in to the first game, intergrate it with better graphics and UI, leave it open on Steam to mod, and save all those content creators on You Tube who were either left twisting in the wind or shown to be shills for an inferior product.  Instead they chose the AAA studio path. Put out an unfinished mess to save Q3 earnings. Make it as bland and broadly appealing as possible to get the fish hook in as many mouths as they could, and monetize the shit out of it. The word tragedy comes to mind.  I don't write reviews often, and never negative ones. I'm not as CS hater. If you look at my review for CS 1 I practically gush.  But when you take a vibrant, engaging simulation, and a equally vibrant and engaging community supporting it, and destroy them, I have to call it out for what it is: An example of sloth, crassness, and greed.  There is an answer. They mat have played me for a sucker in buying the base game, but they will NEVER get a dime more from me. They will NEVER get me to trust Paradox enough to pre-order on of their products, thinking they they are some not like Bethesda, Ubi Soft, or any other AAA a-holes who would shame a con man. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.  If you want to change this behavior, just do the same. Just say NO. You deserve no empathy if you put your hand on the stovetop a second time and get burned."
174971013,english,1,949230,"Colossal Order please re watch your own promotion video from 5 years ago by Justin Roczniak/donoteat01 and listen to what he says. That's what a good city simulation needs to be able to do, on top of being a good looking city painter.     Its a start but still has some odd design. I think the worst part is somehow its more sterile and overly clean felling than the first game. Shame on Paradox for pushing this out the door long before it was ready. Making hardware requirements this high end was a fundamental misread of your audience. City builders are traditionally played on mid range systems and laptops and by people who often don't prioritize cutting edge first person shooter/ action game graphics."
158795794,english,0,949230,"The CEO is a joke. Constantly blaming the player base for beeing ""toxic"". You are scammers not more not less.

Congrats.  Normaly i wouldnt write any comment on that and just carry on, but the rly annoying behavior of the CEO, since release, trying to set themselfs as victims here is unaccaptable.

186093265,english,0,949230,"So many issues. You better have a huge C:\ drive because this game, no matter where you install it, sends all mod folders and downloaded content there. And you can't change it. They decided to have their own workshop platform, despite the fact that Steam workshop was perfectly adequate - and so far, they've distributed actual malware to their players, held up mods for almost a year straight, the game has to refresh 4 times in the main menu and you have to restart it several times.  I'm currently in a dilemma where I can't even access the game at all, even when launching with mods disabled. Round of applause for Paradox and CO please. These complaints don't even scratch the surface, have a glance at other reviews to appreciate the scale of ineptitude. Maybe buy this in 5 years? When they've figured out the basics. Because at the moment, it is a horrible headache of a game."
149251690,english,0,949230,"Setting aside graphics performance at launch, which is terrible, Cities Skylines 2 is a deeply broken city simulation game.  To be more precise, it doesn't actually simulate a city in any meaningful way and it's barely a game.  The economy and various systems are all FAKE; smoke and mirrors to give you an illusion of control and choice. Don't build a garbage dump? Garbage will be automatically trucked out of your city on its own by magic. Fail to have commercial or industry? The city *just works*.  The ""much improved"" traffic AI they claimed would eliminate the first game's traffic problems? It just makes cars teleport to their destination if they're being too slow.  These are a just a few examples, but every single thing they claim is being simulated, isn't. It's all incredibly shallow and fake and falls apart with more than a surface inspection. In terms if city management, simulation and city designing, It is several steps backwards from the first Cities Skylines in every way.  It is completely unsatisfying to play."
150319952,english,0,949230,"""Thanks for the chats all, but I'm moving on. :) EDIT: (Nov 17) I've heard from Paradox support to the query I logged. They confirm I was banned for this post, where I said ""Publishing games as bare bones as possible (even removing content to plunder later, looking at you pre-release DLC that CS2 has), is customer abuse IMO."".  The Paradox support person went on to state: ""Frankly I would have issued a much sterner infraction than the minor ""trollish comments"" one you got for that!"" (I can provide a screenshot of the email to those interested).  My comment got me a one month ban. Proves my point. ------------------------------------------------------ ORIGINAL POST STARTS HERE: I love city building games. I mean the ones where you can build up massive modern metropolis's like in this game. I remember getting my hands on SimCity back in the old days, and instantly fell in love with it. I would lay down roads, zones, services for the city, and watch it grow at my hands. And I loved every single city builder that came along. The various SimCity versions (except 2013), Cities XL/XXL/all the versions, City Skylines, and Highrise City. SimCity 4 is definitely my most favourite of the city builders.  When I heard that Cities Skylines 2 was being made, I got pretty excited. But also, pretty worried. I was really excited, because a new game in my second favourite type of game was coming out. And the videos made it look really good! But I was worried. Worried because Paradox was publishing it.  When CS1 came out, it was an insta-buy for me. I really enjoyed the game. I was happily playing along, making cities, and then the DLC start coming out. Before CS1 came out, for years I had bought Paradox games and the DLC. However, I was really getting annoyed by the DLC policy of Paradox. CS1 came out on the heels of the 80th or something DLC for Crusader Kings 2. Not to mention the countless DLC for HOI and EU that I also played. So when the DLC starting coming out thick for CS1, I decided it was time to bow out of Paradox and put them on ""the list"". ""The list"" contains the publishers I will not buy games from. There's a few now, including EA for what they did to SimCity/Maxis. Paradox had joined them. I did not buy a single item from Paradox after June 2017. I wanted to, believe me. But this was my very minor protest against their DLC policy.  And then came Cities Skylines 2. I actually held my ground, until the day before release. I knew if I bought in, I'd be buying into the DLC flood. I was really conflicted. I knew Paradox was going to DLC the hell out of the game, and there was the performance announcement before hand but I knew from experience (with my work) that performance can (and usually does) get fixed. But I REALLY wanted to play a city builder. So I caved, and bought the standard edition. Hey, at least I would minimise my losses to $70 (AUD).  The day came, and I downloaded it, and started to play. After changing a few graphics settings, I was okay with sitting on medium graphics and tuning a few things like RPS suggested to. And I played.  But it wasn't too long before I started noticing things. But I kept playing. I noticed even more things, and read about similar things others were noticing on the Paradox forum and here. I got to 25 hours and wrote my review. I didn't want to give a cheap 2 hours review, so I gave the game an honest shot. I was actually really shocked how popular my review became. I just wrote what I honestly saw in the game.  Then the hostility began. I found myself banned for 3 days at Paradox forums for the most flimsy of reasons (the review was being discussed there and I commented on that thread). At around the same time, I started getting threats and hostile posts on my steam profile, my workshop items for other games, and ended up playing whack-a-mole deletion of posts. No point reporting as they were level 0 empty profiles just made to attack me. But I did keep playing, because maybe they had a point. Maybe I'd misunderstood some things.  Anyways, eventually I hit 85 hours. I was done. I did an update to my review, and my 3 points that I feel kill the game for me stand. They are: 1. Performance and bugs. Whilst performance had improved on the graphics side, over 250k pop my PC would start suffering from repeated stuttering. This was simulation, not graphical. The list of bugs is massive. Just look at the confirmed list on Paradox forums. 2. Lack of content. The extreme lack of content is really disappointing. Obvious hat tip to DLCing us to hell. Yeah, there's a content creator pack of some couple thousand assets coming for free, but I would put a hundy on it that the original point of that pack was to introduce paid-for curated special content on Paradox mods. But they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants and giving it for free now. 3. Design choices. There are lots of design choices that just simply don't make sense.  It was at this time that I posted a new thread on Paradox forums outlining the above, and that I was putting the game down for now. Shortly after that thread was posted, I found myself banned for a full month. I have read carefully the code of conduct, the infraction matrix, and also the support page on forum user rules. I cannot see anything I could have legitimately been banned for. I can only think it was because I have been vocal in honest criticism (it's not the only time Paradox has been caught censoring their forums of negative feedback). Their code of conduct and support page also give you some instructions when banned. Contact the moderator in the instance, or if you cannot contact that moderator, email admin@paradoxinteractive. The irony is, when you are banned, you cannot access the messaging system to read the notice why you got banned. Nor can you reply to it. So I've tried emailing (politely) the email address a couple of times. I've had no reply. I don't believe I will get a response either.  So at this point, I am done. I feel that my feedback is not wanted, nor do they want to hear it. I believe that Paradox doesn't want me around, and I will just continuously be banned at Paradox forums, and if I continue to post here, banned here as well. I actually don't think this post will last long, but hey, let's give it a try. I'll screenshot it and post it to my steam profile. Avanya can't get to me there. Hahaha.  I will never, ever, buy another Paradox product. My experience with Paradox in the past, and especially recently, is that they are a hostile, abusive company that will stop at nothing to suppress honest critical feedback that they believe may impact their shareholder profits. My belief that Paradox is an extremely toxic company has been reinforced with my recent interactions with this company. I will never engage with Paradox forums again. I will never engage with any of their product, or the products of any company that has an association with Paradox. I am completely done with this company.  To everyone I've chatted with here, go in peace and have some fun. Thank you, all of you, for the fun times I had here. Even you Stealthy, even though I still think you're a Paradox employee here to muffle out any negative comments. You never did answer my question, but it's okay, you're off the hook now.   My review: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998739866/recommended/949230 Paradox thread I got one month ban for: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/its-time-to-put-cs2-down.1608679/""  This is the state of CO and paradox as a entirety, this one persons feelings has everything I have to feel about Paradox. They have gotten to the point that they just ban criticism because its ""mean"" This game along with CK3 and Vicky3 clearly show that we are little more than cattle for PDX to harvest for money. Friends its time to retire from playing PDX games. Its been a good ride but all things must come to an end."
177621498,english,1,949230,"This game still lacks a lot of of basic things and feels unfinished. But I have to admit, I haven't played CS1 since I got this game. Overall, I like it."
185833970,english,0,949230,"I have never been so conflicted.  I have re-downloaded CS2 about 5 times now, compelled by the overwhelming amount of beautiful showcases of CS2 cities on r/CitiesSkylines. Every time I have re-download CS2, I am immediately reminded why I uninstalled it. I want to like this game, I love the realism of the graphics, the animations of the sims, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and of course the option to make an intersection into a round-a-bout.  Unfortunately despite all of these new features CS2 compares nothing to CS1, I must admit, I do play with all the CS1 add-ons and was extremely disappointed when I first played CS2 to see I could no longer make my own custom university, airport, or park. Even despite all the additional content of CS1, it still prevails as the better game. If not for it's lack of bugs and glitches, then be for the lack of malware issues.  Never before have I wanted, nor even considered writing a review about a game, not even my favourite games, not even the masterpiece that is CS1, but the existence of CS2 conflicts me. I want to like the game, I want to play the game, I want to enjoy the game, but yet I don't. As the sequel to CS1, CS2 looks amazing, and it's features and game play pull me away from CS1, but its bugs, glitches, and, lack of customisation push me into a weird spot where I can't bring myself to play either game, a feeling so weird, it compelled me to write my first and probably only review."
149758101,english,1,949230,"I'm gonna try to be genuinely honest here. The situation for the game is pretty nuanced, and that can be difficult to express in a time when everything needs to be a meme and/or the worst/best thing to ever happen. In short: you can buy the game right now and have a heck of a lot of fun, but the game might have gotten off to a better initial reception had it been delayed for another 6 months or so.  Pros: The game is a lot of fun at this stage, and I am so happy we already get to play it whenever we want.  1. What is here now is definitely enough to call this a ""full release.""  2. You can do a LOT, and you have much better tools out the gate compared to the first game. It's less finicky, while also more powerful, so it's a heck of a lot easier to reach a higher baseline of cool-looking cities. Can't overstate how much of an evolution this is. Examples: road tool is insane, zoning (and the way assets are categorized) gives you much more control, as well as more types of zoning.  3. Performance issues aside, the game is an insane visual upgrade. The game can look frankly shockingly impressive. This ties into the first point to make cities better-looking by default. In the first, you'd need several mods to start making cool cities. Not here.   4. The simulation is really hecking cool. There are some bugs, but in general the way the city works with individually simulated agents makes for a city that has sort of its own life independent of your decisions - all of a sudden, you might notice a lot of people have educated themselves and consequently want different places to work and live so you now have a bunch of other options to build different stuff. Cool! So, it needs a little bit of work, but it's absolutely mostly there.  5. Since everything is simulated, traffic is a lot better. Mostly, you're fine, and at rush hour you get some backup. That's pretty much it now.   Cons: there are pretty good arguments it could have been a) delayed for like 6 months or b) released as an Early Access product.  1. Quite a lot of small bugs. Whether it's education being unbalanced, commercial having weird import/export stuff, or garbage being handled oddly, there's stuff in the simulation that isn't working as intended, or is in need of further balancing. Most of the stuff is simply down to not having played the game enough before to notice, or not having enough time to fix it. I guess it's annoying if you sit and think about it, but not a single one of the bugs have really bothered me in a meaningful way.  2. Performance is bad, but Colossal Order have been very upfront about that from before the game was released. Some of the reporting on it post-release, however, makes it seem like they just didn't have enough time to finish all the work. For instance, the reports on wild amounts of polygons being rendered, the acknowledge (more-or-less) by Colossal Order about LOD work simply not being finished, or the broken effects (you pretty much need to turn some of them off.) You can ABSOLUTELY run the game - just check out the posted performance guides on which effects to turn off.   3. Compared to a very kitted up Cities Skylines 1, with all DLC and mods, you might feel a little restricted. If you've played it a lot you'll come across situations where you go ""what a great spot this would be for a custom park,"" or whatever feature from the first game's 10-year life cycle. If you've never played that version of the first game, you might come across situations where you're like ""so I just build more of mostly the same type of district?"" And...both yes and no. There is some challenge to be creative, but on the other hand that forces you to familiarize yourself with the tools at hand to get the most creativity out of what IS here. Your mileage may vary.  4. Bluntly, some things just make it seem like the game is like 3/4 finished. Why are there no unlocks past the half-way point of the development roadmap (small city-big city etc)? Room for future expansions, or planned but cut features? Who knows. Don't get me wrong, these are non-essential things, but the feeling is there after almost 70 hours in the game.  Taken as it is, you could argue they should've delayed 6 months or released into Early Access instead. But you can also argue that releasing it will ultimately make the game much better much faster by both a) making the developers accountable to the players rather than some arbitrary release date and b) giving them more feedback than they could ever need to improve the game. Is it a little cynical? Maybe. Did they coldly calculate that the short-term reputation loss would be offset by the longer-term improvements of both what the bottom line looks like for the fiscal quarter as well as the game itself? Also maybe, but don't they have a right to do that, and do we need to be maximally dramatic about it if that is what they decide to do? Looking at it coolly, it is a complicated situation for a company, and either way they would have gone there would have been pros and cons. I won't presume I'd know so perfectly well what would be the right thing to do for players, employees, publisher, and the company itself.  Furthermore, you could argue that the Early Access label brings with it certain connotations - a never-ending cycle of waiting for when the game is no longer ""almost finished"" and developers who just abuse the concept to avoid accountability or expectations of quality. Also, is it maybe not allowed to release something as Early Access, when it's already been marketed as a ""full release"" sort of thing? Heck if I know - I'm not a lawyer!  To sum it up: Issues notwithstanding, I'm super glad I'm playing the game now rather than in 6 months. I'm glad I get to play it in a state where I can expect what is there to be enough for a release, and don't have to think about what's a month or two down the line. As for the rest of it, I might feel a way about it, but ultimately I'll leave up to Colossal Order because it's their product in the end."
170579341,english,0,949230,"Ok, cards on the table, I was really excited to see the new release after so many years. But to our dismay, you have somehow ruined it in ways we did not expect.   Pros:  1. better graphics 2. cooler looking city services buildings  Cons: 1. Graphics have STEEP performance requirements.  2. A lot of terrain tools were removed.  3. even on a rig equiped with a ryzen 9 with the 3090 and over 64 gigs of ram, i lag down to 10 fps. 4. population 10,000 lag starts opposed to the 30,000 population that the old game allowed before lag started. 5. Chirper is replaced by radio that wont shut up. even when paused, i hear it. Dear devs, old chirper was annoying enough, but it astonishes me how you've found ways to make it worse. 6. Infrastructure buildings became MASSIVE. so massive in fact, that instead of adding public transport as a feature to your city, your city is a feature of your transit buildings.  7. you can no longer tell where a majority of your path-finding is going on. in the old game, i could tell where a lot of vehicles were trying to go, so i could optimize. here, its all guesswork. not fun. 8. no access to the steam workshop, however you did add your own store so that people who had their mods here, lost their traffic.  9. money. no matter what i do in this game, after SO long with the first one, i cannot for the life of me stay in the green. No amount of tutorials, even COPYING youtuber's ""successful"" cities. i always find myself needing to take out loans.  10. lack of road options. I want a 6 lane avenue with bike lanes and tram lanes for starters.  11. Bugs. i understand that games have bugs on early access, and really early years, but this is some Bethesda level stuff here.  12. you tried so hard to make a continuation of your game to make money, but you are driving away people because you provoke us to write reviews like THIS!   Fellow steam user, please give this game at least another year if not two before you buy."
177252074,english,0,949230,"As a huge fan of the first Cities: Skylines, which—despite becoming a classic Paradox DLC cash grab—still worked and worked well across the board, I had high hopes for the much-anticipated sequel. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Cities: Skylines 2.  The game is plagued by endless bugs that seem to multiply with every patch. Every ""fix"" only introduces more issues, leaving the game barely functional. The so-called ""Economy 2.0"" update? A joke. All it does is give you slightly less starting money, nothing more. The game has been out for almost a year, and we're still missing basic features like hotels. And when you ask about it on the forums, the developers respond with cheery emoticons, telling you to turn on developer mode and manually install them yourself.  Are you kidding me? You can't fix something this simple? Do you even realize that the only reason people didn’t refund your game in the first 20 minutes is because they trusted you? And what did you do? You slapped us in the face. Honestly, I feel like a clown for sticking with this mess for 184 hours, hoping you'd finally get your act together.  Screw you, Paradox. You've earned it."
186493996,english,0,949230,"Dear Paradox Interactive,  I am deeply disappointed. Why does your game crash so frequently that it’s practically unplayable? Given your reputation and resources, it’s baffling that such issues persist. I expected better. This frustration makes me question whether game development is the right industry for you. Perhaps a career in something like insurance—less reliant on delivering a functional product—might be more fitting. At least then, people like me could avoid this level of disappointment. Please take this as feedback to improve, not just for this game but for future projects. Gamers deserve better.  Fuck you.  Sincerely, A truly dissatisfied customer"
148798733,english,0,949230,"Optimization is so bad that even in the main menu, you could tell that the game is harder than Elden Ring because of the boss called Frames."
148794737,english,0,949230,"Everyone already knows the performance is terrible, so I'll just share my experience so you have a further example to compare to. I have a 13900k, 64gb of ram, and a RTX 4090, playing on a 1440p ultrawide monitor. I got 35 fps at the main menu and in game on a brand new map w/o building a single thing. Turning off motion blur and depth field increased this from 35 to 50 fps.  Not a single other graphics setting changed the performance at all. I turned off every single setting I could or set it to the lowest possible, and still only got 50 fps.  This is impressively bad optimization, I actually can't recall another game recently where changing the graphics settings literally did nothing to fps.  Just stay away from this until they fix it."
188024915,english,0,949230,"I hate the way that it lags, the way that it stutters, I hate the way that it plays  I hate the game, I always need to actually push myself just to start the game and then closed it after the pop up launcher showed up.  I was excited to jump into Cities: Skylines II after hours playing cities skyline 1 on steam and my PS4, expecting an improved city-building experience, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and better option at building road (overall yes, more mechanism than CS 1)  what I got was a game that runs like a broken-down Porsche Mauser tank.  Let’s address the elephant in the room: Cities: Skylines II is horribly optimized. The fact that they list an RTX 3080 as the recommended GPU is ridiculous, frame rates are inconsistent, stuttering is constant, and performance tanks as your city grows. It’s frustrating when a game that should be about creativity and smooth management ends up feeling like an endurance test for your PC/laptop.  I was never asking for ultra-realistic, almost dull graphics. The original Cities: Skylines had a clean, semi-stylized look that made cities feel vibrant and inviting. Cities: Skylines II, on the other hand, leans too hard into realism, making everything look too muted and uninspiring. The lighting feels off, textures look muddy despite the “improvements,” and overall, it lacks the charm of the first game.  hard to enjoy when it runs so poorly, I really like CS1 the way the semi-stylized look....even though the animations were simpler, they had a certain charm that made the city feel alive. I like to see a dog turns into a car, I like to see thousand of people summoning their own car or bike after leaving stadium with angry after their team losing. It kills the immersion rather than enhancing it.   I find myself wanting to go back to Cities: Skylines 1, that's still something that CS 2 can't replicate even after 1 year, 3 months, and 23 days after release."

177659738,english,1,949230,Just finished playing 99 hours and I love this game. This is my FIRST computer game (I'm old) and I'm truly enjoying my time in Cities Skylines II and looking forward to what will be offered next.

I put over a hundred hours in it, and I regret that. The bones of the base game are better than CS1, but it just needs more time in the oven and more features in the base game.  I also really resent that Paradox saw fit to release it when they did. It's emblematic of a company that doesn't respect its customers and willfully ignores what its devs are likely telling management."
172636255,english,0,949230,"I bought this game shortly after launch. Despite its initial flaws, I held out hope that the devs would provide patch updates that fixed the issues with game play. Now, despite months since launch and several patches released, the game remains virtually unplayable. Patches meant to fix the game bring about other, larger issues somehow, and it remains painfully obvious that the developers had no business releasing this game when they did. Cities: Skylines 1 became popular in no small part due to the flawed release of another city simulator, and they apparently learned nothing from that situation. I cannot recommend this game."

150199704,english,1,949230,"A potentially great game which is hampered by issues with simulation, glitches, and lack of key features that should have been available from day 1. I still recommend the game, as there is no mixed/middle ground option, as long as one is aware of the game's shortcomings.  GAMEPLAY: Most features from base CS1 are back, together with a mixture of the old DLC content, and even mods, and some new great features of its own. There is a ton of content available, and this is where the game shines.  Building things is much more pleasant in this game than in CS1. No forced roadside requirement. Roads and tracks can intersect multiple other roads/tracks. Upgrading and adjusting roads is much easier. Electricity and water are automatically transported via roads. Adjusting intersections a la TM:PE is a breeze. Roads and tracks can be freely connected to city neighbors. Out of bounds intercity lines are now at the player's discretion.  Buildings can be upgraded via modules, a nice addition and one that quite likely allow for quite a bit of customization later on when mods are allowed - i.e. expandable train stations. Building scale is overall improved relative to the first game, though airports are still horribly undersized.  Maps are bigger, though like in CS1 only a fraction of it is available to the player without mods, and even then there are limits on the number of tiles you can buy. This is a drawback in my opinion, and at the very least the available area that can be bought should be fully available, if not the rest of the map.  SIMULATION: A mixed bag for me. In one hand, traffic is more random and when it works is more pleasant to watch in my opinion. There are nice new touches like seasons - though more control over them is desired - and traffic accidents.   In the other hand, the simulation is very slow, and things take long to progress, even at the fastest simulation speeds. Furthermore, AI vehicles leave a lot to be desired in many circumstances, for example, near highway ramps where they tend to all try to merge into the highway instead of exiting, at the very last second, causing huge backups along the way.  Another key issue for is the separation of residential demand into low/medium/high density. As a sandbox game, the choice of density should be left at player's discretion, especially when commercial and office buildings are not affected by this. In the current state that the game is, there is way too much low residential demand that never seems to end, forcing one to build swaths of suburbia, even if some or all can be replaced at later stages in the game.  GRAPHICS: I quite like the direction of where the game is visually going. However, the execution is poor in that visuals are quite ""grainy"" and pixelated, and can look downright horrible at certain angles and distances, even on the highest graphical settings with a good GPU.  SOUND: The radio with a mix of generic relaxing music intersped with newcasts and talkshows discussing minutiae in and of your city is back. Music is ok but bland, and overall rather limited in which it becomes repetitive pretty quickly. Personally I listen to something else in the background instead.  OTHER ISSUES: At the moment there is no official modding support, or a map editor included, and there is not a big variety of maps to begin with in the base game - only a dozen or so. There are already mods being developed and released in third-party platforms, however.  Furthermore, even when modding support does come in 2024, it will be limited to the Paradox servers, and there will be no Steam Workshop support.  Also, the game may suffer from occasional to frequent crashes to the desktop, so make sure to enable autosave, which comes disabled by default and is a source of grief to many people in the forums. Or at least save manually often.  SUMMARY: Cities Skylines 2 is a game that has a lot of potential but suffers from a rushed release. Updates will likely rectify many of the issues and the review will be re-edited accordingly. In the state that the game is now, and its price, I think is a decent game, and one that is quite entertaining if it runs right, but nowhere near its potential. 6/10  Dec 1st 2023 edit: reduced my rating from 7 to 6, due to finding out no official Steam Workshop, too frequent crashes at times, and quickly dwindling performance in very large cities."

Simulation isn't what it used to be in Cities Skylines 1. 4. No steam workshop. Why not? 5. Tons of features in CS 1 that were cut out of CS 2. Too many to name.

192329091,english,0,949230,"As someone who loved the original Cities: Skylines, I came into Cities: Skylines 2 with high hopes. The first game had tons of content, and the Steam Workshop support made it even better. Unfortunately, this isn’t a review of the first game — and that’s where my disappointment starts.  Cities: Skylines 2 improves on a lot of systems from the original. There are some great quality-of-life changes that make city-building smoother and more modern. But even with those improvements, the overall experience feels lacking.  I pre-ordered the game and received 15 DLCs (I believe) as part of the bonus, but most of them are just building reskins or region-specific buildings that don’t add any real gameplay. It’s hard not to compare that to the DLCs for the first game, or the workshop where I could find similar — or better — content for free. What’s worse, the two DLCs I did buy for the first game (which added meaningful content) are completely missing in the sequel.  It’s hard not to feel like Cities: Skylines 2 was rushed out and monetized aggressively. Despite being out for a while, it still lacks the depth and charm of its predecessor. On top of that, I experience random frame drops and lag, even though my PC should be more than capable of handling the game.  Right now, I can’t recommend Cities: Skylines 2. If you’re deciding between the two, the first game still offers a better experience overall — even today. That said, I’ll be checking back periodically to see how it evolves. If things improve significantly, I’ll happily update this review."
186238355,english,0,949230,I have a love hate for this game. I love the mixed zones and all the great features we had to use mods to get in the first game.   However this game crashes all the time.

149026228,english,0,949230,"Updated on Aug 29: The game is still in a bad shape, almost all the problems are still present, while the last patch was almost 2 months ago. There's still not much on the Paradox workshop due to the ban on external resources. Very sad.  Update on Apr 12: They could've just used the Steam workshop... Reinventing the wheel hardly end up well.  Update on March 11: It's been 5 months since the release and the mod support is still ""in the works"". I cannot emphasize enough how badly CO played their cards and all that expectation, hype, momentum, whatever has definitely died down. GJ CO and maybe I should check back in a year from now??  Update on Nov 1: - Radio is kinda boring and there's limited track list. Even worse the hosts give you straight up false info (power outage, no more water, etc). - Same thing with the Chirpy - Again, traffic AI is dumb! Sometimes they straight up ignore your signage, sometimes they just do the weirdest thing on the road blocking the entire street. Case in point: [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17l6sfu/radio_traffic_sucks_today_meanwhile_cims_hold_my/]see this[/url]   Update on Oct 29:  I have a 6950XT and 12900K, my profile has not updated to reflect this. Sorry if that confused you!  - If you are like me who hated the new white reflection/torn effect on the roads, do the following -- enable developer mode by adding ""--developerMode"" to your launch options -- load up a game and press Tab -- on GameRending > Shaders, disable BH/Decals/CurvedDecalDeterioration (credit to REV0 for this)  - The performance problem seems to be subsided after experimenting with the graphics settings. I have now ~40fps now, but it's only a 20k pop town so will see how things scales. Random stuttering still occurs.  - Traffic AI is actually kinda bad and borderline funny. Erratic lane merging, getting stuck on a roundabout, or 5-point U-turn on a street was often observed.  - I studied some issues in the game economy and the solutions are... uh.... quite not what I expected. For example for the ""Not Enough Customers"" issue, it was advised to tear down its neighboring business(es) until you roll into a biz that happened to use what that shop is selling. For example you can have a Food company with not enough customers, and you should keep demolishing its neighbors till you get a Restaurant company that turns Food into Meal. Problem solved. Or is it???  - Likewise ""Rent Too High"" issue is because my citizens are lacking education etc. to find a job to afford the rent. Despite I have a number of schools all the way from elementary to college. I built buses to facilitate transit. Nope still not enough people literally are broke they can't even afford ""Low Rent Housing"". Guess the game is telling me I need UBI in the city?  And before you asked, yes the game does feel like an upgrade from the first iteration with many much needed changes and QoL improvements. However I do have high expectations from the CO and I hope these issues are rectified before I can wholeheartedly recommend the game.  Do I like the game? Yes but only because I loved CSL 1. Do I recommend it at this stage to anyone? No.   ================================= I really, really, really wanted to like it - but the game could use much needed improvements right now.   Issues includes the following: 1. Performance. The latest 1.0.11 patch did enable ~80fps in the main menu, but in game it's still around 20-30fps. Worse still the game now is stuttering very bad when I pan the camera, which didn't happen with the original release. This made the game literally unplayable for me post update.  2. Tutorial could be made better and more accessible. As of now it doesn't cover basics well enough, and as a CSL1 player I got confused with some aspects still.   3. Rent too high? Not enough customers? Buildings getting abandoned? I have no clue how to solve them and the game isn't exactly telling me how to solve them either.  4. Bugs especially how terrain and buildings/roads interact can be funny.  5. Not mod ready still :((  I will come back and revise this review should anything improves."

Subways have thousands of citizens, but only a few actually board the trains. Only 30 passengers use trains, and half of the cargo trains transport 0% of the cargo load from nearby cities. Tourism is completely broken—no visible tourists, zero hotels, and so on. It's fun to start the game, but once you reach a population of around 100,000, the bugs drain the joy from what could have been an amazing game."

CS2 still has some distance to gain in those respects, but definitely don't rule it out. As the devs start matching the features from CS1 as well as building new features and in-game abilities, CS2 will be quite the superior city builder.

168892554,english,1,949230,"Cities Skylines 2 has had a bit of a rocky start, and I believe it's due in part because of Paradox probably pushing to get CS2 out earlier than it ought to have, and CO being the victim of its success with CS1 that it's set expectation way into the stratosphere.  That being said, with the release of the Economy 2.0 and the now additional assets just released, I would say if you've been on the fence about getting CS2, then I think now is a good time to get into it.  CO have been working hard on getting optimising the performance. They have listened to the community and have retracted the beach property DLC and incorparated them into the main vanilla game instead. They have reworked the economy which is a welcome change and actually makes the game a challenge and fun to play. The newly released assets are fantastic additions that now allow me to build smaller communities, and cul-de-sacs!!  The game still has more promise. When CO release a working version of an asset editor, this game will explode with potential. There's already some fantastic modders and content creators who are able to make truly stunning cities.  If you're happy to mod your game, and are into high level detail, then I advise you check out Sully's youtube video on detailing Snowdonia. It is utterly breathtaking. This is what I wanted from CS2 and Im glad we have it.  I'm not one of these people who set unrealisticly high expectations. I knew full well that any base version of  second game will be a rough diamond. Much like CS1 was when it released. CS1.  Very much enjoy this game."

So... while I've been perfectly happy with CS:II up to this point, I am now contributing my negative review.  At this point the game doesn't even run reliably anymore. I start it. It crashes. With or without mods. So fucking dumb. The whole point of this sequel was to integrate some of the improvements CS1 saw in the user mods so that we had a more stable game base to play with.   That's not the case at all here. This is just a rebranding. It's barebones play that still relies on user mods to make it a functional game. Most of my recent time 'in game', is spent troubleshooting. At least the last 20 hours."
175366797,english,0,949230,"It was one of the few games I was really looking forward to and bought it day one. It was disapointing launch and I didn´t play it for awhile. but somehow playing it now after multiple patches and fixes it feels even worse then launch. Expenses seem unreasonably high, graphics look cartoonish and washed (streets and houses look flat and bland), industry makes no sense and there is a feeling that there is no life in the city, just random cars and people. There is a high demand for high residencial, but no demand for shops or factories? Makes no sense. You need to have car access to park? Why? Garbage piles up so fast in 10k population city. No bike roads, electric cars and busses have no impact, people complain about noise when living in downtown area. Game crashes frequently. FPS has improved over the updates, but still its nowhere near acceptable for a high end PC."
149650170,english,0,949230,"When they announced that the game would release with performance issues I was ready to refund it if the performance was truly bad enough. Gamestar magazine provided a savegame on release to test for performance in the late game. I tested the game using that savegame and found the performance to be good enough. After getting my own city to ~230k pop 50 hours into the game later, this still holds true.  There are so many things I love about this game. They really put a lot of love into the road building tools compared to CS1, I love how for example single lane highways connect into multi lane highways, or roads of different sizes connect into each other in general. I love how trams work. I love how footpaths work. I love the upgrade/feature system for customizing road sections. And we even got surface level subways in vanilla now! I love the detail that went into the economy. I love all the pretty little details you can spot when you zoom in. And I can clearly see that the devs had a lot of great ideas for this game and in a lot of places put a lot of love and effort into it.  However it is also clearly visible that in a lot of other places they didn't get to finish their work. Be that minor visual stuff like some kinds of parks or buildings not properly reacting to the weather and season like other things do. Missing animations for emergency vehicles. Or the fact that many of the systems are just completely bugged. Like the infinite garbage import that completly breaks your city in the late game. Or that they gave us so much to micromanage, but no way of getting any data, statistics or overlays for some of the things you could really deep dive in. Why can I not see the profitability of my individual public transport lines? Why can't I see wether or not my bus line is actually being used at night? Why can I not see how many vehicles I have in my depots vs how many are in use at a glance? Why is there no overlay to see where certain resources are used and produced? Why can I not manage import via cargo trains/planes/ships better? Why can I not see the origin and target location of cars/trucks/pedestrians on the map by simply clicking on the to get a better overview over where my traffic actually comes from? There are so many things that can be micromanaged but there is simply no data to base my decisions on other than clicking and tracking everything by hand. And in the end there is no real point in micromanaging everything in the first place, because the end game economy is basically just having infiinte money regardless of how much I manage my economy until it all falls apart because somehow the entire planet sends me their garbage for processing and my 10 incinerators, 6 recycling centers and 3 dumps are immediatly filled to the max, even when I have twice the amount of processing needed to process my own garbage and my entire city drowns in trash. I really tried to love this game and building up my first city really was a lot of fun. However I'm at a point where I see no point in further improving my city any more, because at any point the garbage problem or something else is gonna ruin it completly and all the improvements I could make don't really matter in the first place. And I see no point in creating another city, just to get to the same point.   When they announced the game would release with performance issues they didn't lie, but they forgot that the rest of the game isn't really finished either. And for a successor of the first game, it really needs the endless replayability, that just isn't there right now. It's not a bad game, but it is incomplete. This game would have needed another year of development or so, but sadly that just seems to be the industry standard now."
173755312,english,0,949230,"BACKSTORY I bought ""Cities: Skylines II"" knowing that the public's reception of the game has been largely negative since its release. I eventually decided to try it out for myself—to form my own opinion. The first game, ""Cities: Skylines,"" was great. I immediately fell in love with designing, building, and optimizing interchanges. After years of play well-supported by both the developer and an incredible modding community that furnished a robust Steam Workshop, the game began to show its age. Enabling a handful of specific mods became standard practice, and certain shortcomings that neither developer nor modder could overcome were revealed. This showed the community that there was room for a sequel of sorts, a second iteration of the game designed from the ground up with certain improvements and capabilities in mind.  Among the aforementioned mods were ""Move It,"" ""Network Anarchy,"" ""Precision Engineering,"" and ""Traffic Manager."" The tools and quality-of-life improvements these mods provided players in turn provided the developer a starting list of features the sequel should include.  MY EXPERIENCE To the developer's credit, many of these improvements made their way into ""Cities: Skylines II."" From a road-building perspective, the underlying code for how roads are managed seems to have received a nice rework and the game has some great new methods for constructing intersections and the like. Sadly, some of these features lack refinement. Some cause glitches while others simply don't behave quite how one might want. For example, connecting two roads *can* work out nicely, OR it can cause the steepest mountains (completely impervious to terraforming tools) to erupt from the median reaching for the heavens.  FINAL IMPRESSIONS All of this leaves the player passionately yearning for what is clearly possible, yet heartbroken seeing it left just out of reach. I think the game has great potential, but lacks polish. It feels unrefined and incomplete. I'm confident the playerbase will create mods to help, but the game will never reach its full potential without corrective action from the developer.  It is also worth noting that a newer, well-spec'd gaming laptop struggles at times to handle the game in its current state. I get the impression that the game is not optimized very well. For reference, I have been experiencing issues while running the game on an ""ROG Strix SCAR 16 (2023) G634"" (Product Name: G634JY-XS97) (SKU: 90NR0D91-M001B0).  Now, I, personally, am left with the decision between requesting a refund (before I sink too many hours into the game) and keeping the game (relying on the developer to fix it). Ultimately, I will likely keep the game in hopes that my purchase will help fund an effort to improve the game. However, if I was more strapped for cash, I would undoubtedly request a refund. At this time, I would recommend anyone tight on funds to abstain from purchasing this product."
175264664,english,0,949230,"I spent hours and i mean hours on a city nd detailed as much as i wanted just for when i saved it, it completely froze my whole computer, and when i refreshed my pc, the save file for my world just disappeared like it never existed. I dont think i spent so much time and effort onto a city before just to lose it all. I would recommend this game but dont take it serious as any bs could happen. I might not be able to get the motivation to play again after this."
172054722,english,1,949230,"Good city builder but good god this game is poorly optimized. Be prepared for lots of sudden FPS drops. The economy and detailing updates have made it worth playing, although I would recommend picking it up on sale."
176459748,english,1,949230,"Recently started playing again after barely playing since launch. This game has its problems, but its still fun to play. While it is missing some features that were present (and highly useful) in the first game, the new features from this game like mixed/medium zoning and the road building are very fun to play with. The graphics improvement is also noticeable if you have a good enough machine to take advantage of it. It still isn't perfect, but this game has come a long way since launch."
190898660,english,0,949230,"Can you please stop releasing new content and fix the game, this new patch has literally done nothing to improve gameplay/QOL. Its getting embarrasing now. Still not playable! Traffic is still Mayham, cars have no real life direction"
175839538,english,1,949230,"I guess putting in 130 hours might be a sign that I really enjoy it... and I do! It had a rocky start with quite a few bugs that needed to be ironed out, but now it's much more playable, especially since the 'high rent' bug has been fixed. I do wish there was an option to toggle off icons in general—maybe there’s a mod for that, though I prefer playing unmodded for now. There are definitely some features from the first game that I wish would make their way into this one, like toll roads, and it would be great if disasters were made even more disastrous.  I like that they’ve made this version more challenging compared to how it felt at launch. Initially, it felt too easy, and I advanced through all the milestones quickly. However, what I still don’t like—and maybe I’m just bad at it—is dealing with traffic. No matter what I try, I can't seem to fully eliminate it.  If you enjoyed the first one and are still on the fence, I think it's time to jump off and give this one a try."
148945025,english,1,949230,Yes there are some performance issues but the gameplay itself is really enjoyable and big upgrade from first generation game. Although bike lanes etc are missing at the moment.
162377447,english,0,949230,"I am sure that this has been repeated ad nauseam in the reviews for this game, but if it had not been for SimCity 2013's disastrous release, the degree of popularity that the Cities: Skylines franchise has attained would simply not exist. One would think that, nearly on that game's tenth anniversary, it might be in mind for executives when determining a release schedule for their game.  Why did Cities: Skylines 1 succeed where SimCity 2013 did not? Simply put, it was unlimited where SC2013 imposed limits. There are many examples of this that you have probably heard before: community content, map size, one-way roads, yada yada. Why is it, then, that some the very things that helped spur the popularity of CSL1 in the first place not the first priority in a full new release?   This is all stuff you've heard before. What I have not heard nearly enough people talking about is that this game seriously lacks charm compared to its predecessors. I admit this is quite subjective, but hear me out. Like it or not, the donut vans and obnoxious sirens of the first game are iconic and goofy, and felt like they gave the game a charming identity; an unrealistic identity, perhaps, but it had spirit. It also had outrageous ploppables, like the Hadron Collider, in case you wanted to embrace your unrealistic side. SimCity 2013, lest we forget, had quirky thought bubbles, a poorly-disguised advertisement for Progressive Insurance, the 100% Electric Nissan Leaf, the whole future expansion that changed literally every zone?? and, on a more sincere note, the most fitting music for a city builder that I've ever heard, ever. There's a reason why the SimCity 2013 music pack for CSL1 was popular (no shade intended, that is hard to follow up). What is the identity of this specific game? Spasm Electronics?  I will give credit where credit is due. The road system of this game is vastly improved over Cities: Skylines 1, as are the building and vehicle models. I prefer the zoning categorization in this game, as it is a major step up in realism. The North American style does feel pretty American (anyone remember Roads United and that whole fisaco?). Roundabout support is very nice. The tree growth and seasons are nice, and adds value to every tree you place down.   The developers of this game are good people and I believe that they wanted to make a good and fully fleshed out game. I believe strongly that they just needed more development time to create a proper sequel, or they needed to release this game in early access, like many others have already suggested. One day I hope to revisit this game once it is in a more playable state, but I am worried that it will never get there, for me."
174677705,english,1,949230,"It is already a very good game and has tons of potential. I think it already surpasses CS 1 and is getting many updates, which is great from the devs. Despite the terrible launch, it has recovered very well and is set for many great things in the future."
148873180,english,0,949230,"Tough One  Long time CS1 fan but CS2 leaves me feeling both impressed at how much the engine has come on and disappointed at how much has been lost.   Firstly kudos to CO for at least warning us that the game was un-optimised, but, looking around at recent history should have told CO that this was an opportunity (However annoyed it may have left fans) for them to delay this release by a few months more to get it into a fit state.   After 15 hours of playtime on the sequel I feel confident enough (With a city of 110k) to review the game fairly.   So firstly the pro's  + Game engine is much improved, buildings look better, animations are much better (For the most part)  + The sims feel much more alive, you see them travelling and periods such as rush hour are now accurately reflected as opposed to CS1 where roads would grind to a halt anytime of day, which leads on to... + The road layout tool is vastly improved, at first it may look like its a simplified version of what we had in CS1 but there are powerful tools underneath the initial views that allow you to control many more aspects of the road layout, the AI also uses roads in a much more common sense way. changing lanes and trying to avoid jams + European and North American options for the most part (Apart from low density habs) look sufficiently different, although things like trains and some lorries are not localised with big old american trains for cargo spoiling some of the immersion  + Development points is a win, replacing the standard unlocks as you grow your city you can now select particular buildings or service in the order you want to, it makes for different playthroughs and options each time and gives you more control over areas to focus on in city development, a major improvement over CS1 + Slightly stolen from the last Simcity but the ability to upgrade existing service buildings is a welcome addition, rather than having to plop 10 different small police stations across your city you can now typically get away with one or two and simply upgrade them with larger garages or improved services. The majority of the time its cheaper than buying a new building and increases the coverage area, which reminds me + The service coverage area for most service buildings is far more generous now, gone are the days of having to plan to build 3 elementary schools all within the same area of your city because of their laughable service coverage zone. Service buildings now cover significant parts of the map. I did the earlier to mid-game with the very first police and fire stations you unlocked until I got to a pop of around 25k, impossible in CS1 without the city resembling a Friday night out in Essex  Now the negatives - Its day 2 of release so mods will come but right now the game feels sparse, minimal buildings and options for many of the different types of service such as schools and police means once you've unlocked one or two lines of each services development section you've pretty much seen it all,  I'm really hoping those of us who invested heavily in DLC for CS1 aren't going to be stung by countless additional DLC that simply should be in the base game to start with. Its pretty weak currently and once you've unlocked most things there isn't a great deal to do beyond continuing to grow your city with the same buildings - The game should have released with the creation kit and mods good to go. If they can bung free copies to 'influencers' to try and butter us all up over the last few weeks they could have done the same for the actual valuable members of the CS community aka the modders. It would have left the launch feeling much less sparse. On the subject of modding, i'm not precious about steam workshop or their own version of it, I would have just liked to have seen mods here at the start to make up for the lack of content  - Pathing whilst vastly improved is still an issue later in city growth. get above 80k pop in a decent size city and regardless of improving your roads, the AI seems to have a fit and forget all of the smart stuff its been doing up to this point and rely on the same core roads and pathing as opposed to the countless other options I tried to put in place for them to use. Which reminds me...  - Public transport feels generally broken at the minute. In a city of 110k I have 1% using buses (Despite very generous spreading of stops across my city, 0% using trams, 1% using the subway and 0% using my passenger trains. Seems pretty pointless, very expensive and totally contributes to the snarling up of the road network. Definitely contributes to the end game making you feel like you are just constantly firefighting the road network than actually city planning and needs to be patched urgently - The UI is pretty awful, everything from setting bus lines to the size of menu screens and the lack of customisation around being able to move with the mouse all feels weak at the moment and less than what we had in CS1. Its frustrating when you are laying out a transport line and suddenly a menu pops on screen and deletes all of the progress you've been making laying out your line. - I'll talk about optimisation more generally below but stability wise I've had one crash (My rig details below) but most important point here, for some unknown reason autosave is switched off by default, which in a game like this where hours of work could be lost to a crash seems insane to me, make sure its the first option you switch on and to the devs I'd strongly urge you to have this switched to on by default.   Optimisation  Ok, the big one.  Firstly kudos to CO for admitting they had a problem, but that admittance should have led to them doing the right thing for their customers and delaying the release, but hey, we live in a shareholder driven world so needs must I guess.   Optimisation is extremely poor depending on your hardware choices, what this means looking at the steam hardware survey is that 99% of people will not have a game that feels next gen when they play. CO have themselves advised switching off a bunch of graphical options to get a decent framerate and whilst this isn't Call of Duty where frames = better, the standard in 2023 should be having the game run at a minimum of 60FPS for the VAST MAJORITY of users. This unfortunately won't be the case for many many people.   So, things to make your experience more stable (if less pretty)  - switch off depth of field - 10-20 FPS improvement - switch off Vsync - same sort of frame gain as depth of field - try flicking between borderless window and fullscreen, some are reporting frame gains of between 5-10 fps - run it in 1080p if you have to - can give you 20fps or more - switch off all of the volumetric options - 10-20 fps   All of the above is obviously dependent on your own hardware setup but on mine (I-9 12900k, RTX 3080 TI 12GB and 64GB DDR5 RAM i've been seeing a stable(ish) framerate of 68-85 fps with a pop of 110k running in 4k.   Your own experiences may vary and i'm not disagreeing that some folks with better hardware than me are having a worse time than I have and this simply reinforces the point that optimisation does seem to be all over the place at the minute.   In summary though, its not good enough, when people with £5k rigs are having to switch graphical options off for a game that isn't a FPS, then something is quite clearly badly wrong in how its been built and delivered to its users.   The hope of course is over the coming days and weeks the game will be patched. But that still isn't good enough for a £41 game that many folks have been pre-ordering and building up to for most of this year. Sure it would have been annoying to delay it by another month or two but it would have earned CO a significant bit of kudos and support from the community rather than the review bombing and open hostility we have now.   In summary then, its ok, but for those with weaker rigs, avoid for now and wait for patches to come. I'm pretty disappointed"

Since the beginning I've dealt with periods of desktop crashes, thank goodness for auto save. Then we'll chug along for a while without crashes. New update comes out, crashes return. Now I get some system log error every time I boot up the game. I've read forums, I've combed through steam, I've uninstalled and reinstalled 5 times now - it won't go away. Supposedly there's a fix but you have to comb through a folder of never ending files, download additional software to identify the failure and then reformat the file. Look, I just want to play the game. I shouldn't have to become a software engineer to play  a game I spent decent money on. I don't know what's going on over at Colossal Order or Paradox, but they need to get their heads out of where the sun doesn't shine. Both entities should be embarrassed.

I've since purchased it again and, with the mods available, I've been enjoying it. The performance has improved greatly for me and so it's been worth it HOWEVER, I must have missed the memo about auto-save being OFF BY DEFAULT and lost 8 hours of game-play when it crashed. I hadn't had any crashes up to that point so I guess it was pretty stable. I do recommend the game but I think there are some really basics things missed. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
148958095,english,0,949230,"a great many reviews so far, both positive and negative, seem to center around performance. while it's definitely true CO shit the bed a bit here, for most people these issues are fairly surmountable (if not still having enough annoying present issues like stuttering for those same users). so i feel compelled to counterbalance that by listing an assortment of the the much deeper shameful issues/annoyances in this sequel  - the improved traffic pathing would really be more appreciable if the ""lifepath"" of cims seemed to matter all that much. there are distinct periods of high (rush hour) and low utilization, but in terms of actual behaviors, cims interact illogically (park at location very briefly before leaving immediately), sparingly, or often not at all - i know this is a complete rewrite of the game compared to C:S1, but how exactly did water physics manage to regress *this* badly? relatedly, don't waste your money on a hydro dam, as it appears to be wholly non-functional for power at this point... - ...or *do* waste money on your hydro dam because it actually doesn't matter—the game economy is opaque at best and non-functional at worst. i'm not sure if people are correct in reporting a *complete absence* of logistics mechanics, but it seems like colossal order have so little confidence in this area of the game that businesses/industries can get by on an excess of goods being teleported/freely spawned in their inventories while also potentially suffering from a lack of customers and continue for an incredibly long time without ever going out of business. i've seen a couple people successfully export goods, but most people report their air/sea/train cargo connections never loading a single thing, while other people report businesses that have no outside road connection whatsoever still remaining in business, so something is seriously broken in all of this. (also good luck getting your commercial plots to ever level up with their ceaseless moaning for customers) - you will frequently struggle to maintain a surplus, probably due in no small part to economic silliness. for most people, they probably are overbuilding services, but it is regardless more difficult than it probably should be. not to worry, though: CO have effectively papered over this by giving you particularly sizable cash bonuses every time you level up in the progression system. unless you've been running a deficit with no profits and few milestones for a while, you're unlikely to ever end up in a penny-pinching situation. this was also true to a large extent in the original game, but that was more because the economy was *easy* rather than due to it being fudged - dealing aesthetically with lots/roads on terrain in C:S1 was never especially fun, yet here we have also managed to regress massively from ""ugly"" to ""looks like a geometry error even if it's not"". actually, building on terrain has gotten worse mechanically in general as well. twice as many slope errors (and twice as easily/sensitively), quays/bridges yelling ""it's in water"" at the drop of a hat for infrastructure *literally meant to be proximate to water*, even if you get a road right on terrain there's a good chance you get stuck with a disgusting retaining wall setup, etc. - C:S2 got us all excited for increased ability to build non-car-dependent cities, in contrast to the original... then what we get instead (besides small ped paths that work similar to the original) is a single type of ugly, wide(!) pedestrian street that pedestrians don't properly utilize (maybe due to aforementioned issues with their day-to-day behavior?), but *CARS* DO LOVE TO UTILIZE (Lmao), especially if you zone commercial along it (like one normally would do with pedestrian neighborhoods). a lot of those commercial lots will end up being gas stations, too. i almost can't be mad at this one because it's so whimsical - further frustrating your plans for a beautiful ~modern and sensible urbanist~ city plan is the fact that it is remarkably difficult to ever push your cims into utilizing the public transit you very considerately built for them. not impossible, but far more often than not you'll see marginal utilization on decent routes. also, remember how i mentioned ped pathways/streets? in your quest to wean off car dependence, you won't see a single bicycle on said pathways. maybe that's just me personally taking offense as a cyclist, but it's yet another inexplicable regression from the original game - roads are, as everybody have noted, MASSIVELY improved in almost every practical way, yet often beyond what a seasoned player might expect. snapping is, all at once, too weak and too strong (depending on context). zoning plots becomes a planner's nightmare as you'll draw out a grid that is composed of perfect 90 degree angles and still get misaligned plots between the roads - expecting all DLC functionality to be in this as sequel is not realistic, but—i'm gonna use this word yet again—the absolute regression here in campus areas, park areas, district zone specialization (besides industry), etc. is pretty gaping - on release of the original basegame, the hyped-up ""district/city policies"" system was a little underwhelming as far as what you could really do with it (and it was only after several DLC that the policies menu had any flesh on its bones). it looks like an absolute abundance compared to the 6 or 7 policies they've given us here lol - i've made peace with the decision to not use steam workshop in favor of (still-unreleased) Paradox Mods but that doesn't mean i don't still think it's stupid and as an imposition upon this game it's just another feeble gasp from the increasingly frail, wheezing body of paradox interactive ever since they went publicly-traded - other cosmetic gripes. there isn't even a tasteful fog to obscure how ugly the borders of the playable map are. all vegetation and any non-sea water (like rivers and lakes) suddenly, visibly do not exist beyond the playable boundary, as do roads—they couldn't even bother with something that kind of resembles a road going off into the distance. the really funny thing is, i've seen (on the Tampere map at least) that trees *can* still render beyond the playable area and some scatter into it for tree clusters on the borderlines. they were just too lazy to add any garnish to this area otherwise. which doesn't really make you want to make use of the nearby playable area lol - death by 1000 cuts. so much across both major and minor functionality is either practically inoperative, fairly broken, or at least a little broken/unbalanced/inconsistent, including: > postboxes don't really seem to work. the postal system does (i think). just not postboxes. there's a lot of issues in other systems that are flat-out silly just like this > road-naming and what the game considers a distinct road is all screwed up. i've had entire grid neighborhoods have 80% of said grid's roads considered one contiguous road. and if you build off a road, you never know how radically the game will shift what it considers to be part of the old road or a new road entirely. custom road names are not protected in this process and you will lose your custom names extremely easily. at this rate i'd rather just pretend road names don't exist anymore and hide them, but hiding labels is not an option (which it was in C:S1) > seasonal cycles cannot be disabled and you cannot simply go to a climate that does not have seasonal cycles, because all maps/map themes are in temperate northern hemispheric climates anyway. your winter wonderland will quickly become a snowy nightmare"

The game is boring. The game CEO is shitting on us and trolling us like we didn’t pay for this game. “If you don’t like the game, this isn’t for you” this is a major middle finger towards the community.

148820365,english,0,949230,"Sadly this review is negative.   The performance is just unacceptable, there are some rendering issues plaguing the game, and on top of that there are some wildly unoptimized assets in this game.  From small guard shacks with modeled out wires, computers and keyboards to the horrendous looking procedural generated citizens that far exceed even some larger buildings in triangle count, they are a waste of computer resources.  The whole unecessary addition of a ''citizen lifepath'' is something very few players asked for, and its clear part of the issues with this game relate to choises made during development of the game.   The truth is, these citizen models look so hideous that they dont even invite you to engage with the lifepath mechanic at all, id rather have they were significantly reduced in detail, or replaced by assets modeled by an actual artist, and not a procgen program, before i would consider paying attention to the ''lifepath'' stuff this game offers.  I wanted to love this game, and in a way i still do, everything else Cities Skylines 1 did is improved in 2, but the terrible performance, and questionable looking assets really ruin the hype for me.   Also, this game has a launcher, and just like the 1st game, its totally unnecessary and offers no utility whatsoever, beyond serving advertisements to you for Nvidia.  This review might change to positive if the optimisation is adressed in the future, and the ability to mod the horrendous looking potatoheads is added..... Before then, if you are not brand loyalist like me, stick to the first game a while longer, this game needs a couple more months in the oven.  Edit: Further thoughts:  After longer play A noticeable issue is that Residential zoning demand is based on *density* not on *affordability*  Wealth does not factor much in where a citizen will move in as much as density type does.  This results in the player having to build an insane amount of low density zoning, even though denser apartment building types would be preferred and more efficient, limiting your planning abilities and creativity.  The game will complain about there being a ''housing crisis'' when the real problem is that citizens will not move into denser buildings.   City policies are negligible and can no longer be applied globally, instead having to be set per district.   Building upgrades are a great mechanic however.   Virtual texturing/texture streaming seems to struggle with alpha mapped objects (primarily hedges) causing them to look cubical with flat 2d planes sticking out of them. This happens even with less performance intensive cities.    Edit: Specs  GPU: GTX 1070TI  CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X   RAM 32GB  My settings: everything set to medium, disabled volumetrics, DOF and Motion blur. 70% resolution scaling.  Average FPS zoomed in: 30  Average FPS at range: 25/20   Population in city used for benchmark: 100.000"

156405585,english,0,949230,"After spending almost 150 hours in this game it’s safe to say I’ve given up.  I’ve mostly ignored all the comments at first so that I can give an impartial view of this game.   Foremost, Cities Skylines 2 is broken. It is riddled with many serious algorithmic and performance bugs that affect core functions of the game. Widely reported bugs such as frequent crashes and taxation glitch, which causes unexpected income and deficit spikes that breaks the gameplay — and this is just one of many serious ones out there   While it is understandable for bugs to be present in games and software, Colossal Order’s lack of urgency and genuine interest in tackling bug reports makes it unacceptable.   It’s been 3 months since launch, yet recent statements from the company were deliberate in evading questions on roadmaps for bug fixes, and attempt to obfuscate users by saying that something is being worked on for the near future.   Hard to believe that this is the same company that made Cities Skylines 1 — a realisation of what the company once was. For now, stay away until more is done.   —  (Quick update — 29 Jan)  I’ve given this game another shot with a fresh install and a new city — issues remain and let me summarize my experience  - At first glance, Cities Skylines 2 provides many quality-of-life improvements compared to Cities Skylines 1, such as better road building and modern assets.  - You’ll find that it is now a breeze to build roads, highways and intersections, tools are intuitive and easy to use. Want an intersection? Just drag across an existing road and you’ll have an intersection. Want a roundabout? Just plop it down.  - Assets are refreshed as compared Cities Skylines 1, gone are the cartoonish buildings and vehicles.   However, most of the gamebreaking issues start occurring as you progress into the game.   Game stability and optimization - As your population increases, game simulation will slow to a crawl — despite my setup being well above the recommended specs  - Occurs on my two different cities and save files.   Service Mechanics - Garbage management and healthcare vehicles will regularly depart from their facility and return almost immediately (alerts will popup frequently that healthcare and garbage management is inadequate despite well within their capacity) - Buses, trams and trains will frequently and randomly despawn or stop working completely.   Economy and industry - Taxation for industries will become highly erratic due to an algorithmic bug, taxation income will fluctuate randomly by the millions for a town of 10k citizens. Completely breaks the budgeting and financial system.  - Local industries will not export goods, cargo terminals (both air and train) will hoard all mail and breaking the mailing system (also impacts citizen happiness) - As confirmed by many others, due to a land value bug, prices will increase to astronomical levels, which makes residential suitability zero for most parts of your city and its outer suburbs.  - This the most critical bug since it completely stops the progress of your city and game, as residential demand will be zero, and no new citizens can move in.   These are just some of the numerous bugs I came across while playing this game —  you do find yourself having to look up online for any workarounds whenever you come across one.   While I’m almost certain that these issues will be addressed eventually in the future.. but is this what it is expected of a published game that cost $50? Was this game ready to be published in the first place?   After two gameplays and two cities, one thing is certain for me — Cities Skylines 2 would not have passed QA and should not have been published in the state it is in. This game is in beta."
162086856,english,0,949230,"Generally speaking I don't like to do reviews, I know they're beneficial for the community and they help buyers decide, but return policies exist for a reason, and that reason is so that people can try it, decide if they like it on their own, and then return it.  That being said, when something is in such a state of horror that it defies logic, I think it's my duty to save you, the reader, from making the same mistake I did...  I have been playing City Builder games since before a lot of you were born, I started with the first Sim City in 1989 and have been an avid fan of the genre ever since.  I love how the genre evolved over time and the games became more complex and at the same time more rewarding.  It's my idea of a perfect saturday afternoon, sitting down, listening to some chill music, and watching as my planning unfolds into this megalopolis that was in my head.  I love it so much that I had even started my 4-year-old daughter down the path by having her sit with me and picking and choosing where we placed certain things in Cities Skylines 1 and showing her how the different mods worked..  When I saw the advertisements for Cities Skylines 2 I foamed at the mouth with excitement, and my daughter was over the moon that we were going to get a new, better game that promised many more hours of enjoyment.  We decided to purchase the top package that guaranteed us the most bang for our buck and the not yet released but announced DLCs that would add stuff as we started a new city together.  We stayed home on game release day to make sure we were among the first to download and start building our new shiny city together.  Much to our dismay however, the game was slow, clunky and basically unplayable on a Threadripper 3960X w/ 128GB Of DDR4 and 2x RTX 3090's.  We were sad to say the least, but we still had hope.    People started sharing settings, then official announcements came with other settings, and we finally stopped having 13fps and got it up to 30fps.  So it was playable, right?  Well, not really.  There was still masssive stutter from time to time, especially when inside of game menus... I mean, they're menus, why on earth are they causing the FPS to plummet and dropping dozens of frames?  It was, and still is so bad, that it randomly causes the USB to reset and the famous Windows chimes that tell you when a USB has disconnected, and reconnected play through the speakers.  And then a patch was announced that promised to fix some of the biggest problems with performance, so we stayed home again, only to be let down once again.  There was maybe a 5 percent performance increase overall, and the menu's were still causing massive game lag.  CO admitted fault and released patch after patch after patch in quick succession, that we were overjoyed that soon we would get to be able to enjoy the game...   But that time never came...    CO stopped patching, but promised that they would not release any of the DLC and more paid content until they got the base game right, because that is what was most important to them...  Another promise... another let down...  Now, not only did they release a paid DLC before fixing the game, they had to gall to charge $9.99 for it.  Bare in mind here, I paid for the deluxe edition, so it was ""free"" for me, but it also let me know how much extra I would really be getting for the extra money I spent, and it doesn't seem like much...   If I had one piece of advice for anyone looking to buy this game in its current state, it would be to run, very fast, in the opposite direction of your computer screen...  I cannot n good conscience recommend that anyone buy this game.  Instead, take your family out for a dinner, go see a movie, go spend your money on anything else, just don't buy this game.  I would recommend spending the night in a trap house or a shooting gallery before I would recommend you purchase this game...  So thanks Colossal Order, for not only stealing my money, but also disappointing my daughter...  Shame on you and Paradox interactive for releasing such a steaming pile of garbage..."
159724986,english,0,949230,"Cities: Skylines II - the game where everything is made up and nothing matters.   Its the game equivalent of the DJ pushing all kind of buttons on his mixer that is not plugged in while an mp3 just plays on his ipod.   Do not spend money on the game in its current state if you expect a city builder that actually simulates the behaviour and movement of people and  goods. Right now the game is just a tool to build something that looks visually like a city but has no inner logic or function. People and vehicles are just animated background noise. Their behaviour barely influences any important metric and all your game play decisions don't influences them alt all. A few examples:  - I build a ore mine on an island with no road connection. Before i could even finish the passenger ship connection there are 60 workers employed at the mine that must have swam over there. I finish the ship connection but not a single physical person steps onto the island. Looking at the stats the mine is producing a couple hundred tons of ore per month. Not a single truck moves anything out of the mine to the cargo terminal.   WHY DO I BUILD A PASSENGER AND CARGO CONNECTIONS WHEN PEOPLE AND PHYSICAL GOODS DO NOT EVEN NEED THEM?? IN A CITY BUILDING GAME THAT IS ALL ABOUT MANAGING THE FLOW OF PEOPLE AND GOODS???  - Because the animated people and cars/trucks that you see in the game have absolutely no influence if your city works or not all your game play decisions have no real consequences. You would think if you build a shitty city where people are stuck in traffic and cant get to work there will be a negative consequence. But because the person doesnt need to be physically present at work it matters zero if you build a highway from their door to the office or have no physical connection at all. There is no motivation to do anything because there is no consequences either way.  - The people physically present in the game do not behave in a way that is understandable. You click on a random person just getting of the train leaving the station to find out that they are going to work on the other end of the map where the train just came from. because there is no way to show the actual path you have no clue why they took the train away from their destination.  - even if we ignore that the game has no internal logic and rules your still building ghost towns. my current build of 10k people looks like a big city with highrises and all but there are maybe 1/10th of the actual people around. no real traffic problems because there are very few cars around. If you think that is because of public transportation think again, busses trams and co have mostly 1 -5% utilisation. The industry that is on paper producing thousand tons of goods have the occasional truck driving around.   - rush hour does not work at all. All streets have a graph that shows the traffic flow over the course of the day and every single road has a flat line that does not vary depending on time. If you have only every tenth person on the road at least have them leave their house all at the same time.  In conclusion I'm very disappointed that they spend so much time to develop a super complex ""simulation"" and then decided that non of it actually matters. It feels you are looking at a animated picture of a city while there is a complicated excel spreadsheet  on the other monitor crushing random number and they hope you are dumb enough not to notice that they have nothing to do with each other."
181467107,english,0,949230,"To put it fairly, Cities: Skylines II isn't bad because it's abandoned or given any false promises. But rather, while there is indeed significant effort after release to fix and improve the game, the disastrous release has still left mountains of problems unresolved. And now while the game is probably at 60% confidence for [i]release[/i], it's already resuming selling cosmetics for coins, which is why I have to add a thumb down to it.  The disaster of CS2 is a combination of over ambition, terrible risk management and project planning. This game was built on weak foundations and has been heavily misdirected to keep stacking on it - namely, the economy simulation.   CS2's key feature and improvement over CS1 is the much more in-depth economy system with individual level citizen needs and more types of supply & demand. The bad news is this system has never worked. They started with embedding fake dummy figures to make it [i]look [/i]functional, then, after being picked out by players, reworked the math two or three times (I lost count if we are at economy 2.0 or 3.0). [b][i]It still does not work. [/i][/b] And more crucially, players have little to no way to make it work.   There are only very limited micro management tools which makes 80% of the stat charts in the game pointless - you can stare at them, but there is no way to respond to them. What's the point of having dozens of industry types when I can't even assign a district or building to a specific industry? What's the point of having a patch to ""give more salary to employees"" instead of making it something adjustable (e.g. minimum wage or income tax rate) in the first place?  CS2 essentially introduced an overly complex model to replace what's trivial but working in CS1, to achieve the exact same goal - to generate district demands - but failed to provide enough tools to players to integrate it as part of gameplay. There are so many gaps and vacancies between this simulation and the actual gameplay, that are either reserved for DLCs or simply overlooked. However, instead of filling the gaps by providing more policy tools,  more specialized city service types etc, the devs have only been cooking and recooking the math of the simulation... which is quite pointless.   This makes CS2 not qualify for a city simulation game. It's at best a [i]scene building [/i]game that is no way worth $40. Adding on with the performance downfalls, the modding dramas, and the unending list of [i]small [/i]bugs - all lead to the very same question: [b]why would you release the game in 2023, if it is still not ready after one year?[/b]"
160957874,english,0,949230,"I say this with no hyperbole, this game is so bafflingly bad it arguably has destroyed Colossal Order's reputation.  Cities: Skylines 1 arguably revived the city building genre and was a critical darling. It had flaws, but it was at its core a product with legs and heart behind it, and its community was well earned.  Cities: Skylines 2 feels like a cheap mobile game, like World Box or something, where you just place objects and get pretty views.  On the one hand, a lot of people play Cities as more of a model set rather than mechanical game, so in some ways Cities 2 is 'better' because you can get a prettier view... but the default assets often are very repetitive and you can't currently mod in anything to get variety or to customize your city, and many of the mechanical aspects of the game dramatically interfere with making a city that looks just the way you want it. So while you can get some good shots that look sort of like a real city, you can't get some of those magical moments you can in Cities 1 where you set up everything juuuust right and have created a city of your dreams.  So the game launched without real custom cities, but it could lean on its simulation aspects... if it had any.   Cities 2 promised to up the fidelity of the simulation to, frankly, silly and unbelievable levels. I never believed you would really be able to follow individual cims and see that they have a cohesive life, so the fact that doesn't actually work is fine. The idea of trying to accurately model and track literally tens of thousands of interacting agents is stupid.  The problem is almost no simulated element actually works. Cities 1 took a lot of shortcuts for its simulation, but it had an internal logic that made sense and facilitated the core challenge of a city builder: conflicting needs of different types of activity in a city putting pressure on your ability to lay things out and connect them, because while things didn't have formalized connections, you still had a clear logic of what sort of resource would be demanded by what zone you plop, and where they were likely to come from. Did it make sense that the industry building that was nominally making phones would receive raw meat and then ship out their finished products to a commercial building that was a donut shop? No. But on the macro level you understood that resources need to go to specific refineries, which then go to industry zones based on distance, which then created abstract goods that needed to get to commercial zones while generating traffit.   Cities 2 has a detailed economy that tracks companies, specific industries and supply chains, supply and demand, production, ect... and... it doesn't work. Its a downgrade from 1.... because goods just teleport. You literally don't need to do anything. The game has all these bars and graphs that SAY 'X industry needs more ore products' but you don't actually need to ensure they can get them, and that makes sense because you can't actually set up things on that specific industry level anyway, so even if the system worked it would be a nightmare... but instead it just doesn't work at all and you can just toss anything anywhere at any time and basically not care because people and goods can teleport in a game primarily about connecting zones.  This isn't even going over bugs like with education. The core concepts of Cities 2 don't really make sense, which is why I am not surprised they are fake, but its baffling that in a game for simulation nerds they would ship something so transparently broken and non-functional and worse than 1... when they could have just made a simulation like 1's with maybe more detail on industries, better road making tools, and the new density system. Its just so confusing why the game is like this and why they just made something that doesn't work, and never likely will work.  Just play Cities 1."
149590916,english,0,949230,"Beware: traffic simulation, economy simulation, and sim life simulation are not designed to work together   Bought the game. Performance issues, not a big deal, it will get sorted. Playing along, about 15 hours in you realize the ""deep simulation"" is fake. Initially I realized there was a cargo bug. Nothing was getting exported via harbors or train or air cargo terminals. Although that itself was bugged, it revealed a HUGE issue that was put in by design. Turns out, the traffic simulation, the economy simulation, and the sim life simulation are all not connected to each other, which makes them all not really impressive at all. Sims have jobs, but don't actually have to go to work. (Same with school) Businesses need goods to operate, but don't actually need them to be exported or imported by the road system. You can have an industrial zone without any connections to the outside or the rest of your city and the economy side of things will work without issue via magical teleportation of goods and workers, in a game that is supposed to model traffic and ""create rush hours as your sims go about their lives"". Uhh, yeah, sure CO.   ""deep simulation"" they said over and over again.  I feel deceived on this one, and quite frustrated that I didn't realize it was all disconnected until past the refund period.  What the heck CO, I expected better than this.

""Why did you play it for 176 hours"" -90% of reviews are from people who barely get past the introduction and then provide poor unhelpful feedback that doesn't actually tell potential users anything of note.  ""Try not comparing a ten year old game's content compared to a one year old game"" - All about the value proposition. If the game doesn't adequately innovate mechanics, while also offering substantially less than a previous iteration - what is the point of getting the new game?  🔴 As for the things that I have ommited previously and that make me pissed off even more (even though the game is objectively getting better of course):  - I can't stress it out enough how terrible the pathfinding is.  - Poor graphics - I mean honestly, the game is newer, but is it really better looking? Grass textures are hideous, we have cartoonish cars, bland and simply sad colors and design of many buildings. CS2 was released the same year as Baldur’s Gate 3, Hogwarts Legacy, Alan Wake 2 or Lies of P. Would you have guessed it? Absolutely not, UI is better and it's easier to build things, but that only distracts from the simple fact that the game is ugly. Jesus, compare it to Manor Lords...  - Texture clipping, uneven road zoning, incomprehensible downcasts or road shading, misterious holes in the terrain adjacent to the structures, in other words dozens of minor errors that you spend a solid hour trying to fix because they sting your eyes and you'll go crazy until you fix them  - Lack of many tools that would mimic CS1's absolutely essential mods, like Traffic Manager or Intersection Marking Tool for example. Jesus, we still can create much better organised and more detailed intersections in CS1 than here. How they couldn't simply include at least the first 3 pages of most popular CS1 mods in the new game? The receipe for a success was so simple...  - Still no bikes, quays, just a few types of roads and intersections etc. - again, JESUS CHRIST IT'S A SEQUEL AND THEY CUT OUT SO MUCH CONTENT, THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.  - Related to the previous sub-item - promenades? PAID DLC. Almost any leisure and entertainment? PAID DLC. A few modern buildings? PAID DLC. Any region pack, after adding just a few most basic ones? PAID DLCs.  Disgusting."
180847633,english,0,949230,"City Skylines 2: A Huge Step Backward!!!  I’ve been a dedicated fan of City Skylines 1, pouring over 1,200 hours into that game and thoroughly enjoying every moment of city-building and management. Naturally, I was excited for City Skylines 2, and despite the initial mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance. After spending 250+ hours trying to immerse myself in this sequel, I can confidently say it’s been a MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Last night was the FINAL STRAW. I played for about 4 hours, carefully building my city and manually saving my progress multiple times to ensure nothing would be lost. Yet, during my final save, the game CRASHED. I didn't check the game archive at the time, because that's the kind of thing I'm USED TO. (Well done, City Skylines 2 team—you’ve successfully conditioned players to lower their expectations and tolerate glaring mistakes as if they were just part of the package.) When I reopened it today, all my save FILES were COMPLETELY GONE. Everything I worked on vanished as if I had never played at all.  For a game that demands long-term planning and hours of investment, technical issues like crashes and save file corruption are UNFORGIVABLE. This is basic functionality, and the fact that such issues persist after the game’s launch is UNACCEPTABLE. While City Skylines 1 felt polished and reliable, its sequel feels like a rushed, buggy mess that UNDERMINES the player’s TRUST and PATIENCE.  Unless the developers address these critical issues immediately, I CAN NOT RECOMMEND City Skylines 2 to anyone. It’s A HEARTBREAKING STEP BACKWARD from a franchise I ONCE LOVED."
154958535,english,0,949230,"The game needs to be better optimised and grinds to a halt when you get a few hundred thousand population.  So many people saying ""but CS1 took 7 years to get to where it is"".   Then I suggest you don't buy this until 2031."
150341735,english,0,949230,"Hmm this is going to be a tough review.  Much like everyone else I was very excited by the game when they announced and showed it.   When I first starting playing it I was enjoying my time with it but as the hours rolled by I think for me at least for now I can't recommend this game in its current state.  Man I wanted to truly like this game and sometimes I still do but well...  A decent amount of the core features are improved, The graphics, style, road placement and management and UI but at the same time there is also quite a lot missing, barely improved or outright worse or missing.   For starters the game is buggy, certain systems don't quite work or are planned out poorly especially the import export stuff. Then there is performance.   Some people may excuse it but I for one certainly can't. Having personally worked in the Unity ecosystem for 5+ years I can personally say they dropped the ball here. The graphics are great, Truly but the design and optimisation is going to take a LOT to fix an I feel bad for the engineers behind the scenes.   As a fan and customer I personally feel there no reason this game should barely be lucky to hit 30fps at low-medium on the best system costing thousands of dollars on the market especially when in a lot of areas the overall simulation while mostly better then CS1 its not that much better tbh.   This is made even worse when you realise most of the maps lack a LOT of details that were in the previous entry including grass of all things.  That is not okay and other details overall you will find its just missing or lacking overall,   The service vehicles don't have animations, there is less variety to all of the npcs and AI compared to the first game, Everything is sadly very static in regards to the ""world"". Most of the AI is just going from A to B and you can't even see the direct path they are taking unlike the first game which makes management of traffic more annoying then it needs to be especially for a sequel.  I think pets work now, Pretty sure I've seen dogs clocking in or walking home which can be more easily noticed once you hit 100k civs, which yknow honestly is just a hilarious bug.   I have three civs in my city which have been standing still since 20k and are now old people, One of them fucking died and whenever I want a laugh I just check up on them. It is another funny bug.  Pretty sure dogs at launch floated as well.  A lot of my very smooth roads have clipping issues into the void below on the sides of them an issue I don't remember being present in CS1.  I found it really tough to make my city look and feel unique outside of tree placement and road and terrain layouts because the detailing is a feature that not only hasn't improved from the first game but is seriously much worse then CS1 and overly lacking.   From a distance everyone's creations look amazing but when you zoom in aside from the awesome sense of scale which is a positive here in a massive way everything is the fucking same and it just sucks. Somehow less variety then CS1 at release side by side which makes no sense.  Like fences really? I can't even place fences? or quay walls which were in the first game, I can't modify existing details within buildings? or rocks and benches, I can follow an NPCs ""life path"" but god forbid I wanna actually make the houses they live in somewhat unique outside of naming with the same or similar tools the devs used to make them.   There is also very little in terms of variety for zone types which is kind of sucks considering this is suppose to be a sequel and placing specific zone types at times can be very frustrating, Like sometimes a certain house type will spawn for 99% of an area then for whatever reason wont for no real reason, Don't like it? Just remove the roads and start over and hope it works for the 2nd time or 3rd.   Also no idea why a plopable Rico isn't here in the base game. The assets are there, LET ME CHOOSE THEM PLEASE.    As time has gone on I have found myself finding more things that are were present in the first game but for whatever reason are not here or worse many things which are not improved at all.   For a sequel this really only has minimal major improvements of the first and the things which are improved they can't really make up for what is either worse or about the same as the first game..  Lane management is barely improved and its very frustrating to say the least combined with the traffic AI.  At low pop its not so bad and honestly seems alright and they even have working suspension a cool small detail however once you get high up there the simulation starts to break and brain of the civs just goes out of the window, Its like suddenly at 60k and above everyone decided booze were for everyone!   I spent more time stumped at how brain dead the AI overall can be before attempting at trying to fix it.   I had massive traffic jams stretching for miles with my interchanges barely being used. When I zoomed in they were all turning last second in multiple lanes, Some would do U-turns sometimes more then once and just cause chaos which for me at least is made even worse as IRL I'm learning to drive right now and the AI is making decisions I don't think I would ever make in a car even if I was 10 years old. Its insane!   Not to mention services, I have found the new feature of making them district restricted quite useful which is a positive but it still hasn't fixed the AI, A dead person is waiting for transport right across the road from the cemetery... WHAT? They are lucky that meteors can't be thrown willy nilly like in CS1.    I think this needed at least another year in the oven and if that wasn't an option early access at discount, Would of been better for the brand, devs and community.  That isn't the worst of it though. For me its how they have responded the community initially and how they made sure to tell the creators before release not to mention the performance and giving them weird restrictions. They knew exactly what they were doing and did it anyway. From the announcement of the hardware requirements going up hidden in a larger message to banning a long time community member for valid criticism.   I think in time they can turn it around, They did pretty good with CS1 and I think fully realised that games potential to the engine and design limits. Here I think the concept is good its just the execution. The bones are here for a great game. A lot of the core systems are in place begging to be polished or in quite a few cases outright fixed especially in regards to the overall simulation and I do love the art style more this time around although more variety is needed. What I have experienced so far overall I can see the potential down the line but for now it is just not here yet sadly.   The more I play this game the more depressed I feel about what could have been yknow?.   I love some parts of it but some other parts I just loathe and get annoyed. I'm currently trying to make a very realistic city and I'm running into so many design limitations with the current tool-set compared to the first game without mods it just kind of sucks.   I overall feel very mixed. At times it can be really great and chill, Other times it can be the opposite.  Hopefully they can improve the overall performance, Fix all the major bugs & at times broken simulation, Add in the missing features that were present at the very least from base game in CS1 at launch and MAYBE just maybe we will have a good start to the sequel for DLCS, Free patches & overhauls for many years to come.  If you want a proper sequel look elsewhere or come back in a year. Its a fine game overall even with the issues just don't go in expecting greatness, Some parts or better, Most are the same and some are worse then the first game.  It isn't worth the full price, Not even close, 40 AUD max, 60 AUD with the extra content. 5/10 (great potential) ~ SirJarko  Maybe in a year it will be worth it? Lets hope"
171930650,english,1,949230,"[h2] Intro [/h2] While I really enjoy the modern take on city building, Cities: Skylines 2 falls short in several areas I hoped would be improved from [i]CS:1[/i]. Although some features have been enhanced, many aspects feel very similar to the previous installment. Below are my thoughts, the good, the bad and the ugly!  [h3]Passing Thoughts[/h3] If you’re wondering whether it’s worth playing at the moment: [b]Yes and No.[/b] If you’re looking for a modern city builder and don’t mind some rough edges, then yes, it’s worth trying. However, if you prefer a more polished experience and want to wait until the issues are resolved, then it’s best to hold off.  [h3]The Good[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Engaging Sim Life:[/b] Just like in [i]Cities 1[/i], watching your sims go about their daily lives is a pleasure. The new feature allowing you to track a sim throughout its lifespan is a welcome addition. [*] [b]Improved Road System:[/b] The revamped road-building tool, including slip lanes for highways and dedicated turning lanes, is a significant improvement. While these features could have been added via mods in [i]Cities 1[/i], it’s great to see them included in the base game. [*] [b]Enhanced City Services:[/b] Power, water, and sewage now travel underground, eliminating the spaghetti-like pipes of the previous game. Additionally, there are more city service buildings available, offering varied services to your sims. [*] [b]Expandable Buildings:[/b] Many buildings now come with extra modules to increase their capacity. For instance, schools can be expanded with additional buildings, which reduces the need for numerous schools and service buildings as seen in [i]Cities 1[/i]. [*] [b]Mixed-Use Zoning:[/b] This feature, which I wished for in [i]Cities 1[/i], is now officially supported in [i]Cities 2[/i]. [/list]  [h3]The Bad[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Stagnant Gameplay:[/b] The game doesn’t evolve with city size. Managing a small city feels identical to managing a large one, unlike other city builders that offer varied and evolving gameplay. [*] [b]Lack of Challenges:[/b] There are no significant constraints or meaningful decisions. Problems are typically solved by simply ""building more,"" making the gameplay feel repetitive and flat. [*] [b]Limited Improvement:[/b] Although certain features, like highways, have seen improvements, fundamental issues with the grid layout and overall gameplay remain. These issues appear too deeply embedded to be resolved without a major overhaul in a future installment. [/list]  [h3]The Ugly[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Modding Platform Shift:[/b] Moving from the Steam Workshop to a third-party [i]'Paradox Mods'[/i] platform is a poor decision. Despite some solid features, this change detracts from the ease of modding that the first game provided. [*] [b]Poor Aesthetics: [/b]The grid-based design and focus on American urban sprawl lead to bland, unattractive cities. Specialized industry zones and modern industry representations are particularly weak, resulting in uninspired city layouts unless you sacrifice density. [*] [b]Bugs:[/b] The game still has several significant bugs, even after recent patches. For example, homeless people may remain indefinitely in your parks, which detracts from their intended use and overall enjoyment. Although the developers are aware of this issue, the lack of progress in addressing it is concerning. [/list]  [h3]Is It Worth It?[/h3] I wish Steam offered a middle-ground review option, rather than just ""Good"" or ""Bad."" While I enjoy the game, it remains quite rough around the edges. If you can tolerate some bugs and occasional issues, it might be worth trying. However, for most players, waiting [b]6 months+[/b] is probably the best option. Although I believe the game will have a long lifespan, I’m concerned that its poor initial reception might impact its future."
159365546,english,0,949230,Holding out on content so they can drain us of our money with DLC. The scheme is so played out now a days.
169445745,english,0,949230,"So this is from someone who played CS1 both modded and vanilla, with access to the DLCs (some features of which should have been in the base game, and others available as working mods from dedicated modders).  I would not recommend this game in it's current state, as it is buggy and does not work once the zombies take over (Note: This is not a zombie survival game).  UI			 	Roads will glitch when creating intersections, offramps, etc. (which is probably why they recently released a visual ""patch"" that allows adding pavement, etc.  	Your processing speed will slow down every time a zombie is created. How is a zombie created you may ask? Simple, if you purposely (or accidentally) destroy a building that houses any amount of people, those people will walk out to the street and just stand there, looking for a new place to live. But, since you most likely have an outside connection (*I even tried without an outside connection, still broken) those ""available"" homes will be taken by new people, and thus a zombie is created as ""Moving in"" or ""Idle"", if you destroyed a commercial zone, you create ""Shopping"" zombies. These citizens will stay in your city and slowly eat your processing power until your game speed of 3 is 10 minutes for an in game day to pass. Unsustainable, and game breaking (only the first of many game breaking issues with this game).  	Sometimes the weather works, and other times it does not and just ""glitches"" to the next day when it is sunny again.  Traffic			  	The AI doesn't respect lanes (no surprise that the AI still does not work when it comes to traffic), as they will turn in no turn lanes and do six to twelve point U-Turns wherever they can, multiple times. This is more common if you add or remove a road *anywhere* in your city, and it also happens when you add a sidewalk or crosswalk. This common task causes the AI to ""re-think"" and recalculate it's route, which causes them all to ""shift"" their routes.  		No individual lane control which means the dedicated turn lanes are determined by the angle of connecting the side roads, and a matter of one pixel will determine what the lanes do in response. Also, the traffic signals and signs are ""node"" specific, so there is no way to put a stop sign on just a sidestreet, etc., this was ""fixed"" in CS1 with mods.  	Cargo train stations are broken, they will not deliver goods between cargo stations, cargo airports, or cargo ships, and goods that are created locally from industry go no where, and commercial starts importing everything individually anyway, causing your industry to basically do nothing but create pollution.  	No weather related buildings (Heat, ice rink, sowplows, etc.), as they probably want money from a ""Snowfall"" like DLC from CS1	  Power/Water			  	Combustion banned zones should have increase power consumption, and there are no charging stations for EVs, only gas stations for fuel, ""Green Cities"" DLC?  	You can start a map importing power, but not water, so if you want to export water from the beginning tile you cannot (only for those that play with just 1 tile...)  	No water removing services, so enjoy those floods when you make a mistake.  Population			 		GAME BREAKING bug that I have no idea how it made it out of QA and passed Dev...zombie homeless just stand on the road taking up processing power, although some of them become homeless people that pay taxes and ""work"" but don't move into an available house or move out of your city (or actually ""go"" to work), and eventually become zombie robbers that kill your city...as mentioned earlier. This breaks your game in 1 way or another, I still don't understand how it made it out of Dev and QA and was released in this state. It is incredible how little it seems CO/Paradox cares anymore... 			 Healthcare			 	No deathcare	or childcare, probably want money from a ""Sunset Harbor""	like DLC from CS1  	The aforementioned zombies still negatively contribute to the overall health of the city, also killing your city, and when they get sick or die, healthcare and deathcare cannot ""pick"" them up so you get stuck with symbols flashing on your screen on of sick and dead homeless.  School			  	There are no preschools (or daycare) as mentioned earlier.  	No law school or dorms, probably want money from a ""Campus Life"" like DLC from CS1.  	More people ""stuck"" in building then ""eligible"" to be there, zombies live in schools and other buildings so even if a certain amount of people are eligible to go to school, they can't because every school is completely filled, until you have a map that is just elementary schools.  	Educated sims still become Robbers at an incredible rate, and soon you will have a city of Well-Educated Homeless Robbers who are Happy and Wealthy. Good luck getting rid of them, no amount of taxes or lack of city services will deter them.  Police 			 	Well, the police are currently broken as they cannot ""arrest"" homeless robbers, and since there is no way to control patrolling or set up stationary ""standing"" locations for police vehicles, 3 police cars will drive around chasing 1000 criminals in a town of 500 people, causing the crime to kill the city. At least my police helicopter flies 10 feet south above my river on it's routine patrol, just to turn around and land. Also fun to watch my 3 police cars drive into a crime scene, look at the robber (or group of robbers as the AI just stand there) and then drive away without making an arrest. 		 Fire			  	A waste of money being ""on"" all the time as they don't help with traffic accidents or house-calls for EMS, or hospital, etc. Can just turn it on when a disaster strikes or a fire starts, but other than that it is super expensive to do very little. 			 Parks			  	No ""Parklife"" benefits, i.e parks built on sidewalks, etc. Also, no amusement parks, zoos, aquariums, etc. because, of course, they probably want money from a ""Parklife"" like DLC from CS1.  	No ""professional"" sports	 stadiums (which I believe was actually free from ""Sports Venue"" DLC)  	Trees are easier to plant, but can no longer ""clean"" polluted ground, and do very little, if anything, in stopping noise pollution.  Disaster			  	When an area floods, there is no way to remove the water without destroying buildings and using landscaping tools to ""push"" the water back. Cars will just drive through it, zoneable buildings will ""build"" underwater staying in a permanent destroyed state, and other buildings will just stop working unless you notice the water surrounding it.		  	Only tornadoes and forest fires (every 10 minutes or so, without fail), and no disaster routes or control of the shelters that are available, probably  because they want money from a ""Natural Disasters"" like DLC from CS1.	 			 Zones			  	No real district control, as there are laughable amount of polices (that do very little, imo).  	No historical buildings (no way to ""save"" a building model you like to preserve it)  	No hotels/motel/gas station manual control, even though it is purposely built into the Economy 2.0, again things that were basic in the ""After-Dark"" (Leisure and Tourist spec, etc.), ""Hotels & Retreats"" and ""Green Cities"" DLCs.	  	No ""industry zones"" which means no control of what ""companies"" move in, even though this is a big deal in Economy 2.0.  No way in vanilla to even see company info.  	No standalone warehouses or industry/company specific warehouse control to pick from, again because ""Industries"" DLC	made this available in CS1, another paid DLC.  	Zoning ""too much"" will create broken empty buildings, common in industry creating ""warehouse"" UI models, but no company will ever move in, or houses that remain empty even though homeless people are looking to move into a house (or college kids moving out of their parent's house live in a park or become a zombie instead of moving into one of these buildings), or you will get 5 of the same company in a row (or 5 gas stations, albeit different companies) in a row, or very close to each other."
178543649,english,0,949230,"I wanted to like CS2, but I can’t recommend it. The base game is boring, and you need mods to make it interesting and to fix basic glitches. Unfortunately, that led to my first-ever malware after 28 years of PC gaming, all because CS2 lacks basic protections—like two-factor authentication for mod uploads. Thankfully, the malware seems to only target crypto, which I stay away from, but that risk is too big to ignore. I am done with this game, and don't know if I will be back."
165142706,english,0,949230,"I have been waiting for some update to past before writing a review for C:S2.  If you want a city builder and nothing more, go for the original; If you want to build your own city with style, go for the original with dlc; If you want realistic simulation, go for the original with mods until your cpu is cooked; If you want to use the game as a sand box and go for pure beauty, go for the original with asset until your gpu is cooked; If you want to use mod and asset, go for the original which has !! STEAM WORKSHOP BUILD-IN !!, no 3rd party bs;  YES THEY EVEN MAKE THE WORKSHOP A THIRD PARTY THING SO NO MORE EASY CLICK FOR MODDING.  This does NOT worth even HALF of its price in current stage."
161134221,english,0,949230,"Half a year has passed since the game's release.  I've been patiently hoping Colossal would fix their game, and didn't request a refund when I had the chance. That was a mistake. Several months in, they still haven't fixed glaring optimization issues, or their simulation engine. Opening the game to see 20 fps in the main menu or on an entirely empty map on 3080ti was a very special experience.  Since then, in response to well-deserved constructive criticism regarding the game, the developer just showed their belligerence and tried to wrap it as ""playerbase's toxicity"" instead of fixing their barely functioning game, or coming up with excuses in line with ""if you want better performance our game might not be for you"".  Stay away from this game, it was released in an alpha state and has not been fixed ever since. Instead, their resources went towards paid DLC content."
158262106,english,0,949230,"I’ve liked playing Cities: Skylines 2 so far. It’s definitely an enjoyable game, with a lot of promise. That being said, the game does not get any points for being “enjoyable” and having promise. The bar was much, much higher for this game  While it’s not fair to expect CS2 to be as feature rich and polished as CS1 is, so close to launch - it is fair to expect it to be fully functional to the extend we were promised from marketing.  I can forgive the lack of assets. I can forgive the bugs. I can forgive that we were told that the game would initially launch without mod support and that mods would no longer be run through the Steam workshop.   But more than 3 months after release, Colossal Order has not been able to deliver timely updates to fix numerous bugs, let alone deliver features that they promised. Mod support and console release keeps getting delayed. Performance has been getting better but it is still an incredibly demanding game for what it is.   In 2023 and now 2024, the sad reality which I’ve come to accept, is that games will be released with bugs - lots of bugs. What is completely inexcusable is that they are no longer pushing updates for bug fixes/patches independently from DLC launches. Major patches will now be released alongside paid content.   In 2 years I’m sure this game will be better.  But CO deserves a negative review until then; this game should be marked as early access and its price should reflect that. Do not buy this game until then. You’ll have a better experience buying CS1 + DLC and modding it to your liking."
154112824,english,0,949230,"The potential is there but this game is in beta at best. I put hundreds of hours into the original CS and this game is awful in comparison. After 70 hours of trying to pull off builds, everything is bugged, nothing works as it should, and there's just no fun to be had.   Not only are we paying to beta test this for you, you're releasing DLC instead of fixing this buggy mess? Shame on you for the scammy product, shame on me for buying the ultimate edition.  I wrote the above review in December 2023. It is now 2025 and the game still feels like a buggy beta but it is almost playable. I guess I'll check in in another year."
173953297,english,0,949230,"so after  over 400 hours, and 50 hours since last update, i'm furious with this game. i've never seen so many different unrelated glitches in one game. i never leave reviews, but i had to get this off my chest. the longer you play on the same map, the more glitches appear, which is so frustrating, i spend hours and hours working on one single city, and by the time i get to a population of 100k, the entire city is so broken it becomes unplayable. things that were working fine when i started a map, start breaking, the land itself starts glitching, a wall of dirt will appear around your city, the buildings wont level up. the ocean level will magically jump 10 feet, flooding anything close to the water. when i say its a broken game i mean its broken."
158923154,english,0,949230,"Over 500 hours I've played this game and I'm done. Here's the gist:  [list] [*] [b]The amount of assets is dismal.[/b] Every residential house looks the same and there's like three variants. Every other commercial building is a drab gas station. Every high-density office building looks like a 20-story, gray, concrete masonry column of sadness. So gloomy. So dull. [*] [b]The lack of assets creates a horribly bland experience.[/b] It's not enjoyable/realistic in a city of 100K population to have three different house models and 100 office buildings that look like identical gray Lego bricks. [*] [b]The game is unplayable over 100K population.[/b] Speaking of large cities, the gameplay and graphics come to a excruciating crawl once a city's population nears 100K. 5800X3D processor, 128 GB memory, and a 4080 card? Doesn't matter. Slo-mo everything. And that's with extensive ""performance enhancement tweaking"" of the settings. [*] [b]Industry doesn't matter.[/b] Importing too much convenience food? Well too bad because building more industry to produce it locally will only spawn another hundred stone mills so you'll have plenty of rocks being produced. Oh and deleting and respawning industry buildings does nothing except create more rock shops. Maybe after two hundred deletions you [i]may[/i] get a timber plant. [*] [b]What about industry taxes?[/b] Best to not mess with these. Going to 0% or even subsidizing industries to encourage production makes no difference. Also, random industries will create literally hundreds of millions in revenue or cause a deficit in the hundreds of millions unless the tax rate is set to 0%. [*] [b]Ok just import/export using cargo then.[/b] Not a chance in heck. Traffic gets so backed up at train/sea/air cargo stations that trucks despawn and nothing is picked up/delivered. Unless you build ten cargo stations across your city. [*] [b]But, just like in real life cargo stations will hoard local and outgoing mail, right?[/b] This doesn't happen in real life but in CS:2 it does. Once a cargo station of any type is built it will hoard all your city's mail rendering post offices useless as no mail trucks ever pickup mail from the cargo stations. [*] [b]Schools[/b] Elementaries are hugely comical in size. No one goes to high school. Everyone goes to college. [*] [b]Parks[/b] No one goes to parks except the homeless who setup camp there. And forget about building large, beautiful parks like in CS:1's Parks DLC because that was left out for some reason and we were given boring, generic parks. [*] [b]The road tools are nice.[/b] [/list]  3/10  Go back to CS:1  EDIT: I just can't quit you, C:S2"
162773838,english,0,949230,"TLDR: Broken mess of a game.  Simulation is broken. Radio stations are awful. Performance sucks. Rolling out DLC without fixing the game. Play CS1 instead, don't buy this travesty."

The game is still not optimized. A broken economy.

156075470,english,0,949230,"To be upfront, I have only reviewed this game now due to their first press release of the year. I have complaints with the game  in general itself among other things, but the biggest thing I cannot excuse is how the devs repaid their loyal customers. CS1 was a near masterpiece and outside of good game development, the devs were loyal and friendly to their customers. CS was the only game I can think of for a long time where buying DLC, while costly at times, was hardly a second thought because it both added content and was repayment for how much respect we as customers had for them.  CS2 totally flatfaced most of us. I bought CS2 not too early after release and expected what something between what was written about it and what I saw in CS1. I quit playing 10 minutes in when my graphics were all over the place, didn't work half the time, and when they did I felt like they stepped down considerably from CS1. After a number of updates I played again after hearing it's better quality wise. My honest opinion on CS2 is it's not only unfinished in many areas, but in places the game has taken a one step forward, two steps back approach. Like special industrial zones changing and how they did was nice, but it felt off the mark in other places like with how unnatural the zones are and how not many people can even occupy that site as a job. And of course CS is a traffic heavy game, but CS2 traffic AI is beyond broken as even with perfect road design you will always see cars paralyzed by excessive yielding and cars wanting to turn into a turning lane so they can turn out of it at the next traffic light - and god help you if you don't yield to their wanton desires.  Overall there's a lot of stuff that should be in the game that isn't, stuff from the old game that should be (like what happened to designing intersections with stop signs?!) in the game, and buggy issues that have yet to be fixed. And with a game so close to modders, you'd think day one there'd be mod support. There are mods right now that could be here on Steam, that have fixed a lot of the issues mentioned, but aren't here because the devs have spent their time doing whatever it is.  At the end of the day I can at least move on and forgive knowing these devs since their track record with CS1 was great. But since CS2 the devs have seriously not only let down their fans but outright betrayed them. And now they've gone full out blame-game by accusing the fans - their loyal customers - of being toxic. They suggest just making honest critiques and making suggestions but then ban or delete anyone who makes them in the game's related forums for being toxic. I was originally waiting to see if they would fix more with the game before I left a review of any kind, but after seeing this latest toxicity accusation against us, I decided to join others who've left negative reviews in order to show the devs we don't appreciate being missled and gaslit about a game they should have had no issue releasing in the first place. I will only swap my recommendation if they apologize and fix the game seriously from now on. Until then I will continue to play since I have the game, but I will not buy anything else from this devs like DLC until they change their ways."

177024877,english,0,949230,"One year later and the game is still missing integral features that were literally promised in the promotional material. The economy still doesn't actually function, meaning you will not see goods from your industries travel across your town; everything just teleports as needed.  Your finances make no sense because somehow you just get more money but cannot figure out where it is coming from, resulting in there being no way to fail. It's also great to see their CEO literally _lie_ about features of the game before release, and then _blame the customers_ when the reception to their half-baked pile of shit is poor.  This game is not only bad, it's literal consumer fraud. Colossal Order have burned to ashes whatever positive sentiment I once held for them."
149097733,english,0,949230,"REVIEW UPDATE: I am now at 85 hours. After learning the mechanics of how the simulations work, I will admit my original review is influenced by not fully understanding some mechanics. For instance, the constant low density residential demand.  Aside from bugs rendering whole chunks of the game broken, such as trade and garbage bugs, after 85 hours the biggest issues I have with this game are two-fold: 1. An extreme lack of content. Building (and farm) diversity is extremely lacking. I suspect content will be DLC'ed to hell, which I strongly oppose Paradox's DLC strategy of removing content to the bare bones and then selling it to players later.  2. Design decisions that just simply don't work, or don't make sense. For instance, pegging ""wealth"" to ""education level"". Wealth should be pegged to career instead. How off map city services function also doesn't really work. They work against the principle of building a healthy, functioning city. If you lack a service, it doesn't negatively impact your game, except that sims have a little less wealth as they pay for the off map service. But that's easily countered by cheaper taxes. Standard genre features like the RCI meter work differently to all previous city builders. Instead of showing what to build for a healthy city, CS2 RCI meter shows what the city wants (which most likely doesn't result in a healthy city). Design changes away from genre standards are fine, just make sure to include in game ways to let the player know what the change is from the genre standard.  Anyways, after 85 hours my final conclusion stands. I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2. Aside from performance and bugs, the game has very little content, and has design decisions that don't work, or don't make sense.  ---- ORIGINAL REVIEW: I tried to like CS2, I really did. I can ignore the performance issues and bugs, as these are things I see being fixed over the short term with some patches in optimisation. However, there are much bigger issues that you need to be aware of. The numerous simulations in the game have such foundational flaws in them, that I believe this game is the most fake city builder of them all.  This game is marketed as ""the most realistic city builder ever"", with multiple levels of simulation in the city, sims, economy, services, and traffic. Unfortunately, there are huge flaws in each are of the simulation.  After 20+ hours playing, aside from the known performance problems (which I've mitigated by running the game at lower gfx than I should be), these are the biggest issues I see:  - The economy is broken. Goods in your city aren't actually traded. Import/export don't actually do anything, so trucks deliver goods to your stores and train stations, ports, and airports, but the transportation networks never pick it up to deliver off map. Industry, commercial and residential don't use your produced goods. There is no cargo traffic in your city, because there is no simulation of producing goods, transporting them to your shops, and then sims buying those goods. It's all completely fake. Colossal Order have confirmed this on Paradox forums.  - The progression system is broken, just place a tourist trap and bulldoze it, repeat over and over. Level 20 without doing anything. Progression is not linked to population, just ""XP"" gained from placing stuff. Thing is, it doesn't remove the XP if you bulldoze straight away. As a result you can have a ""Flourishing Metropolis"" with 50 people. Each main step should have a population limit. IE: town 10k, city 50k, metropolis 100k or something.  - Most people don't actually go to work, kids don't go to school, people don't shop. You can track individual sims. When you follow them, they actually don't go to work. They will get in their cars, or walk to the tram or whatever, jump on, and then do a circuit back home. Or they'll arrive at work and get straight back onto transport again to come home. Kids do not leave the house. They will stay in their homes, not going to school. The whole rush hour thing is a joke. Basically, the sims simulation is..... fake. And this is the big ticket item that this game is sold on. A simulation of each individual sim, going about their world, doing what the do. Living, growing, prospering, dieing. All faked.  - The city only ever demands low density housing, never anything else. City of 50k, with very little office demand. Always, low density residential will be 100% demand. You can even buy 20 tiles, do a massive grid of low density residential, it'll all pop into existence and demand will still be 100%.  - You don't need to build any city services, it all comes in really cheaply from off map. It's cheaper to import all services, than to build the services yourself and pay for maintenance. The only exception seems to be power and water. You can export power and water for enormous profits.  - Maintenance and expansion is not balanced at all. For some buildings it's cheaper per unit to build a new one, and some are cheaper to just expand. For instance water pump: $10,000 to build 100,000 unit pump, and $7,000 to expand one an extra 50,000 units. Cheaper to make a new one there.  - The traffic AI is just absolutely stupid and retarded. I couldn't think the traffic AI could be worse than CS1, but they actually managed to do it. Cars will do u-turns in the middle of a highway. Cars will stop in the middle of the road, jump across 3 lanes causing a big traffic jam, just to reach a left-hand turn they go straight through instead. Opposing carriage turns (ie: right from left side drive, left from right side drive) will not wait till the approaching through traffic is clear. They will turn like it's the middle of Delhi and cause a huge accident or traffic jam.  - The economy is extremely frustrating. There are no small-town service buildings, so to cater for your citizen demands you need to build service buildings priced for cities much larger than what you have. This results in grinding your city's economy into the ground. The only way around this is to largely ignore city services until at least 25k population when your tax revenue is starting to be enough to pay for these demanded services. All the while the annoying bird, building icons, and radio announcements will continue harping on about all these citizen demands. On the flip side, electricity and water exports are priced so out of balance, that building a few extra coal power plants and water pumps, and exporting every single piece of it, will have you swimming in money.  - The whole off map servicing of your citizens is quite simply extremely flawed at it's foundations. When you utilise off map services, the price of those services do not adjust to cater for the simple economic principle of supply and demand. You can pump as much electricity to the off map as you can, and the game will continue to give you the same high price for each MWh. Same with importing off map services. Using off map fire services will remain the extremely cheap price no matter how many fires they have to come and put out.  - The garbage system is totally cactus. Your incinerators will go get garbage from off map to burn, rather than burning your own. Your landfill fills up, your buildings fill up, and stupidly off map garbage trucks come and get your rubbish. The only way to get around this is to build huge landfills, and once they are full just bulldoze it. Poof, all garbage gone. Since incinerators don't collect your garbage from landfills, as it's cheaper for them to drive off map and get it there, it's the only way to process landfill.  TL:DR - Optimisation issues aside, there are MAJOR flaws in each of the game's simulations. The entire game presents a facade, layered on top of fancy marketing speak. I think in reality, this game is the most fake city builder out of any of the top-tier city builders in the 30+ years I've been playing city builders. Ultimately, I do not see how Colossal Order/Paradox proceed from here."
178876442,english,0,949230,CS2 has been out for over a year what we learned:  It's in an incomplete state. the switch from steam workshop to Paradox mods has caused a crypto wallet stealing virus to be widely spread.

161493745,english,0,949230,Still in beta state 6 months after the release but start selling empty DLCs 🤡
161524576,english,0,949230,"I loved Cities 1, so I instantly pre-ordered Deluxe edition of Cities 2. And I was scammed! :-(  There is no proper simulation/economics in the game. There is nothing to do actually.  Your late game is looking at these messages: - NO CUSTOMERS - HIGH RENTS  But WHY? -> there are not proper stats, information, nothing to fix it.  There are zero challenges with the traffic.  Oh, there is finally a DLC, Beach Properties - like extra assets but you don't have beaches in the game.  I was defending Colossal Order for a long time but releasing the empty DLC, counting on modders to fix the game.  SHAME ON YOU!"
183690450,english,0,949230,"Well, after almost 100 Hours, guess it's Review time...  First, I bought the Ultimate Edition when the game came out, over a year ago by now...in hindsight I shouldn't have done that. But as we all know, hindsight is 20/20…  The Release was awful, dare I say, one of the worst states a game came out I have every personally seen. This game should have NEVER been released in the form it was. I generally like Paradox, I played a lot of their games, some way too much. Same with Colossal, I have over 500 Hours in Cities Skylines 1, but the way this was released, to be frank, I should have refunded it.  Even though all this was bad, you could say terrible, at least Colossal Order communicated with the community, though to be clear, it doesn't change the fact that this should have never been sold as a full price game, because the initial release was more like an alpha test.  I checked every time there was an update and yes they did their best to update it as fast as possible, fixing bugs, improving performance. After 1 or 2 months or so it was playable, performance wise, but the economy was kind of broken.  After a while I lost interest in the game, without modding, the game was dead for me, a waste of €90.  I checked again when FINALLY modding came, Paradox's own ""Workshop"" came, Paradox Mods for CS2. But finding out that ""for now"" we will only have code mods, so no new Buildings made by the community to enhance the game to where CS1 was at that time, was a bummer. In hopes that that would come soon, I gave it a chance. But soon was not so soon...  I lost Interest again and didn't play the game for half a year. To this day, 25th, December 2024, we still don't have close to what came for CS1 over the years. Now one could say with the region packs there is something and I want to thank all the people involved in those for what they made. But why don't we have building mods the way we had them in CS1?  To be frank, I lost hope for this game, I wish this will become what CS1 became, but my gut feeling is that this game is more or less written off as a loss, never to be finished the way it was meant to be in the devs minds. I wish, and I want to be wrong about that. But my gut tells me otherwise    And that's why, for me, for now, I can't recommend buying this game. After over a Year, it is still in a State that feel horrible and I personally have to say, from now on I will be careful with buying Ultimate Editions of games from Paradox, before CS2 they had that trust, that many others lost already, with this they lost that. What a disappointment.   If any of the developers read this. I am sorry, but you probably know as much, if not better, that this should have never been released the way it was. I personally, as a customer, rather wait longer for a product and get a product that is in good shape, then getting what we got. To compare it with something. This release felt like I just bought a car, without Engine, with the promise that that will be delivered soon, and it was just not in stock. Without a steering Wheel and doors."
177184040,english,1,949230,"If you've never played a Cities game play CS1, then with DLC, then with mods first. Come to this if you're a fan of that and want a graphical update, economy, and gameplay change. However, despite this CS1 will always be better for a long time. That is solely because of the amount of time updates, DLC, and mods have flooded into the community. Each fix of CS2 is a step towards the right direction but it doesn't overshadow the fact that the launch was very disappointing. It should never be standard in the industry.   Performance and stability has improved since launch for me. Pretty playable and the essential mods from CS1 are here. It's also a very pretty game but CS2 is not without its flaws including some occasional crashes. Consistent updates will help but buyers beware. This game is a slow burn towards what it can become.  Overall I would say this is a cautiously positive 6/10"
190555071,english,0,949230,Love the fact i Spent over 100 dollars on a single video game to make sure i'd receive all post launch content. Just to be laughed at and asked to spend another 35 dollars not even a year an a half later. Deplorable greed is going to be the downfall of this glorified city painter. Id recommend just play SIM city. Im done supporting this trash company.
166501755,english,0,949230,"I have almost 1200 hours in CS1. I bought it the day it came out and played on and off religiously for almost 10 years. Yes, it was nearly the perfect city builder at launch and was only consistently made better by the modding community.  I was absolute overjoyed when I saw the release trailer for CS2, so much so I took a vacation day so I would be able to dedicate the entire day to playing it when it launched.  Leading up to launch day I ignored the early access reviews and kept telling myself its just nonsense. Launch day comes and I was heartbroken. Poorly optimized, no mod support, no map editor, almost no changes that were promised were working, and the game was nearly unplayable due to crashing and freezing. I still held off on giving a poor review.  8 months later I see that mod support and map editing are in beta, and that the game has been optimized better. I re-download the game and hop in and things look promising. Load into a new game and the moment i go to lay my first road the game crashes. Just completely disappears off my screen. Load back in, new map downloaded from the mod store and it loads in completely dark, no UI anywhere and I couldnt even exit the game because the escape key wouldnt open the menu.  Alt+F4 and uninstalled again. I have 1.1 hours in this game and about 45 minutes of that was browsing the mod store. I can't even being to explain how disappointed and saddened i am over this. I have less and less time to dedicate to gaming now that i am approaching my 40s and CS was ALWAYS the game i could hop into and know i could relax and enjoy. It seems i cant even lay a single road almost a year into launch for a game i paid full price for.  Shame on Colossal Order, i am so disappointed."
191009754,english,0,949230,"I've waited a long time to write this maybe because, while I don't have a full understanding how game development works, I do appreciate the time it takes to produce something like this. But I think I'm at the point where I'm done. I pre-purchased the base edition and ""played"" during launch week, if you want to call it that. I completely understood launch issues and even the fact, many weeks afterward, that they were rushed to get this game out. By this point, not much has changed. I have 2 main issues that I just can't get over.  1. I realize this an extreme personal preference but the idea that we cannot get more pre-made intersection and interchange assets, even if by community modders, kills a lot of enjoyment for me. Call it lack of creativity or intelligence, but I'd rather worry about the layout of the city and not trying to find ways to make a kindergarten level highway interchange for myself. Something the first game did wonderfully in my view.   2. This is much more general of a complaint that my first issue kinda ties into. I keep asking myself, ""What have I gained by playing Cities Skylines 2 instead of the first game?"" Some people would have to point this out to me because, with my play-style, I can't think of much. Defiantly not enough to warrant the money, time, and patience I've put into this game.  I have come to the conclusion that I am no longer going to put any more hope into this game. I feel I've waited long enough and with all respect to the devs, I will uninstall this one and just go back to the first one. Maybe even continue to buy DLC's for it. But I refuse to put anymore faith in a game that is, essentially, a worse quality version of it's previous game. I would honestly love a refund for this game. I would maybe even use the refund to put back into DLC's for the first Cities. But fat chance of that by now.   I want to make it clear that I've been on steam for close to 15 years and I've rarely....RARELY left a bad review. Even when a game was absolute garbage. I would just uninstall and chalk it up as a loss. But this is different. I vividly remember when the first Cities came out and it was a godsend. Sim City had gone so far downhill that I commented to my wife, ""This is what the new Sim City should have been!"" Unfortunately, it only took Cities one game cycle for it to fall into the same hole. One could ask, ""What happened?"" Or  worse off, ""What's happening,"" since it hasn't gotten much past the point of, ""At least it runs...kind of.""  Conclusion, and it saddens my heart to say it, but if you're considering buying this game...just don't. Not even on sale. Buy the first one and save yourself the trouble and actually have some fun."

This version of the game is, at best, in a beta stage and feels like an insult to the many fans of the first game. Numerous features are missing, and we all know why: they’ll be sold as DLC, just to squeeze more money out of us.

[i]This was not the case for Cities Skylines II.[/i] At launch - it was [b]VERY, and I mean VERY[/b] ""optimised"". I am gaming on 64GB of RAM and a 3070 Alongside a Intel i7-10700k, which is a pretty solid build. Result? Average of about 20-30 FPS on Medium graphic settings on a settlement with about 15k people. To also add salt on to the wound - game would frequently crash. I am talking consistent crashes every 15-20 minutes.  [*]Not being able to receive backlash for a very bad release of the game. If you were like most, and were of course, not satisfied with the release of the game in such a state, you would try to go and say it on the forums, write reviews, and ask developers questions as to how the fuck it is possible to release this junk. What you receive? A mute. Maybe a temporary ban for the time being for ""Harassing"" the developers. Now, I understand we are human, and being human means making mistakes. BUT WHAT THE FUCK?! You release a very, [b]VERY[/b] underbaked game, and then you decide to call everyone who doesn't like this garbage as ""Harassers"" and ""Demoralisers"".  [*]Mods. Or - lack thereof.

It's the 9th OC post, and inside, and I quote -  [quote=Colossal Order Ltd.]Public Beta version of code modding and Paradox Mods will be available in the live build by the end of March. Public Beta version of Map editing available in the live build together with code modding or soon after.

188885073,english,0,949230,"After eagerly anticipating the sequel to one of my favorite city builders, Cities Skylines 2 has been nothing but a disappointment. I pre-ordered the maximum version, investing significantly in what I hoped would be an amazing follow-up, but my excitement quickly turned to frustration.  The gameplay and economy have been simplified to the point of being uninteresting. Where the original game offered depth and strategic challenge, the sequel presents shallow mechanics that fail to engage long-term players. Most frustrating is that the DLC strategy focuses entirely on cosmetic additions rather than expanding gameplay with meaningful functional elements.   Also game not received the Ukrainian language support, which feels like an oversight given the global nature of the player base.  Technical issues have plagued the game since launch, with numerous bugs remaining unfixed for over a year. The developers seem more interested in pushing out visual DLC than addressing these fundamental problems.  The final straw came when the game crashed during a save operation. Upon restarting, I discovered all my save files were corrupted and completely unrecoverable - dozens of hours of careful city planning and building completely erased in an instant. This level of instability is simply unacceptable for a full-priced game with paid DLC.  I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2 in its current state, especially to fans of the original. Wait for significant patches or deep discounts before considering this disappointing sequel."
178222959,english,0,949230,"Cities: Skylines II is a promising game that has made significant improvements since its launch. However, it still falls short of its predecessor and the lofty expectations set by its developers.  The recent security breach, where malicious code was uploaded through the mod system, is a major setback. This incident highlights a serious lack of oversight and raises concerns about the developers' competence.  Given these issues, I have decided to uninstall the game. It's unfortunate to see such a potentially great game tarnished by poor development choices and security lapses."
163583527,english,0,949230,"I loved CS 1. For those of us who are not artistically inclined it provided a perfect sandbox to design & create. Truly, if you could imagine it, you could create it. I have (almost) as much fun ""shopping"" for mods as running the simulation (yes, unlike CS 2, CS 1 tries to be a simulation). It was the most unique and satisfying computer game (with the possible exception of KSP) I ever experienced.  But it is time to face facts: CS 2 will NEVER be superior to CS 1. Why?  First, it is not a true attempt at a simulation. The idea that if you cant supply your denizens that magic, invisible Amazon trucks will simple deliver what is needed is just an example. I'm sure there are other examples, but I have better things to do than pick apart the obviously rushed and half-baked work the designers did. What's the challenge of making a city both functional and beautiful if the simulation doesn't care?  Second, this is an UGLY game. The muted colors, building designs, etc. are drab. The resource buildings (how farms and mines are laid) are downright hideous. No corn, wheat or barley fields laid out in a nice checkerboard like (with mods) you get in CS 1, but blobby patches with haphazard buildings strewn all over the place. Did these guys even bother to look at pictures of farms in Europe or the US?  Third: Modding. It should have been a red alarm bell when modding was closed off behind the companies own platform. There really is only one reason for it. They are going to monetize the shit out of this product, and any modders (who are truly the simulation's heroes: King Leno et. al., you are tops!) are going to be frozen out. ""Oh, you have created 12 different palm trees? Well forget it. We are going to give them 4....and make 'em pay."" This will not change. They well make sure that ANY asset mod better than what they want to push down your gullet never sees the light of day. You stick with this simulation, hold on to your wallet, it's going to be a bumpy ride.  The thing is, it all could have been so different. They could have easily put this thing together by bringing in the modders, paying for the IP they put in to the first game, intergrate it with better graphics and UI, leave it open on Steam to mod, and save all those content creators on You Tube who were either left twisting in the wind or shown to be shills for an inferior product.  Instead they chose the AAA studio path. Put out an unfinished mess to save Q3 earnings. Make it as bland and broadly appealing as possible to get the fish hook in as many mouths as they could, and monetize the shit out of it. The word tragedy comes to mind.  I don't write reviews often, and never negative ones. I'm not as CS hater. If you look at my review for CS 1 I practically gush.  But when you take a vibrant, engaging simulation, and a equally vibrant and engaging community supporting it, and destroy them, I have to call it out for what it is: An example of sloth, crassness, and greed.  There is an answer. They mat have played me for a sucker in buying the base game, but they will NEVER get a dime more from me. They will NEVER get me to trust Paradox enough to pre-order on of their products, thinking they they are some not like Bethesda, Ubi Soft, or any other AAA a-holes who would shame a con man. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.  If you want to change this behavior, just do the same. Just say NO. You deserve no empathy if you put your hand on the stovetop a second time and get burned."
174971013,english,1,949230,"Colossal Order please re watch your own promotion video from 5 years ago by Justin Roczniak/donoteat01 and listen to what he says. That's what a good city simulation needs to be able to do, on top of being a good looking city painter.     Its a start but still has some odd design. I think the worst part is somehow its more sterile and overly clean felling than the first game. Shame on Paradox for pushing this out the door long before it was ready. Making hardware requirements this high end was a fundamental misread of your audience. City builders are traditionally played on mid range systems and laptops and by people who often don't prioritize cutting edge first person shooter/ action game graphics."
158795794,english,0,949230,"The CEO is a joke. Constantly blaming the player base for beeing ""toxic"". You are scammers not more not less. You over and false advertised your game and delivered a not working piece of junk. And still you dont get why people are upset. ""We worked so hard...""- Yes and still you managed to deliver shit. Congrats.  Normaly i wouldnt write any comment on that and just carry on, but the rly annoying behavior of the CEO, since release, trying to set themselfs as victims here is unaccaptable.

186093265,english,0,949230,"So many issues. You better have a huge C:\ drive because this game, no matter where you install it, sends all mod folders and downloaded content there. And you can't change it. They decided to have their own workshop platform, despite the fact that Steam workshop was perfectly adequate - and so far, they've distributed actual malware to their players, held up mods for almost a year straight, the game has to refresh 4 times in the main menu and you have to restart it several times.  I'm currently in a dilemma where I can't even access the game at all, even when launching with mods disabled. Round of applause for Paradox and CO please. These complaints don't even scratch the surface, have a glance at other reviews to appreciate the scale of ineptitude. Maybe buy this in 5 years? When they've figured out the basics. Because at the moment, it is a horrible headache of a game."
149251690,english,0,949230,"Setting aside graphics performance at launch, which is terrible, Cities Skylines 2 is a deeply broken city simulation game.  To be more precise, it doesn't actually simulate a city in any meaningful way and it's barely a game.  The economy and various systems are all FAKE; smoke and mirrors to give you an illusion of control and choice. Don't build a garbage dump? Garbage will be automatically trucked out of your city on its own by magic. Fail to have commercial or industry? The city *just works*.  The ""much improved"" traffic AI they claimed would eliminate the first game's traffic problems? It just makes cars teleport to their destination if they're being too slow.  These are a just a few examples, but every single thing they claim is being simulated, isn't. It's all incredibly shallow and fake and falls apart with more than a surface inspection. In terms if city management, simulation and city designing, It is several steps backwards from the first Cities Skylines in every way.  It is completely unsatisfying to play."
150319952,english,0,949230,"""Thanks for the chats all, but I'm moving on. :) EDIT: (Nov 17) I've heard from Paradox support to the query I logged. They confirm I was banned for this post, where I said ""Publishing games as bare bones as possible (even removing content to plunder later, looking at you pre-release DLC that CS2 has), is customer abuse IMO."".  The Paradox support person went on to state: ""Frankly I would have issued a much sterner infraction than the minor ""trollish comments"" one you got for that!"" (I can provide a screenshot of the email to those interested).  My comment got me a one month ban. Proves my point. ------------------------------------------------------ ORIGINAL POST STARTS HERE: I love city building games. I mean the ones where you can build up massive modern metropolis's like in this game. I remember getting my hands on SimCity back in the old days, and instantly fell in love with it. I would lay down roads, zones, services for the city, and watch it grow at my hands. And I loved every single city builder that came along. The various SimCity versions (except 2013), Cities XL/XXL/all the versions, City Skylines, and Highrise City. SimCity 4 is definitely my most favourite of the city builders.  When I heard that Cities Skylines 2 was being made, I got pretty excited. But also, pretty worried. I was really excited, because a new game in my second favourite type of game was coming out. And the videos made it look really good! But I was worried. Worried because Paradox was publishing it.  When CS1 came out, it was an insta-buy for me. I really enjoyed the game. I was happily playing along, making cities, and then the DLC start coming out. Before CS1 came out, for years I had bought Paradox games and the DLC. However, I was really getting annoyed by the DLC policy of Paradox. CS1 came out on the heels of the 80th or something DLC for Crusader Kings 2. Not to mention the countless DLC for HOI and EU that I also played. So when the DLC starting coming out thick for CS1, I decided it was time to bow out of Paradox and put them on ""the list"". ""The list"" contains the publishers I will not buy games from. There's a few now, including EA for what they did to SimCity/Maxis. Paradox had joined them. I did not buy a single item from Paradox after June 2017. I wanted to, believe me. But this was my very minor protest against their DLC policy.  And then came Cities Skylines 2. I actually held my ground, until the day before release. I knew if I bought in, I'd be buying into the DLC flood. I was really conflicted. I knew Paradox was going to DLC the hell out of the game, and there was the performance announcement before hand but I knew from experience (with my work) that performance can (and usually does) get fixed. But I REALLY wanted to play a city builder. So I caved, and bought the standard edition. Hey, at least I would minimise my losses to $70 (AUD).  The day came, and I downloaded it, and started to play. After changing a few graphics settings, I was okay with sitting on medium graphics and tuning a few things like RPS suggested to. And I played.  But it wasn't too long before I started noticing things. But I kept playing. I noticed even more things, and read about similar things others were noticing on the Paradox forum and here. I got to 25 hours and wrote my review. I didn't want to give a cheap 2 hours review, so I gave the game an honest shot. I was actually really shocked how popular my review became. I just wrote what I honestly saw in the game.  Then the hostility began. I found myself banned for 3 days at Paradox forums for the most flimsy of reasons (the review was being discussed there and I commented on that thread). At around the same time, I started getting threats and hostile posts on my steam profile, my workshop items for other games, and ended up playing whack-a-mole deletion of posts. No point reporting as they were level 0 empty profiles just made to attack me. But I did keep playing, because maybe they had a point. Maybe I'd misunderstood some things.  Anyways, eventually I hit 85 hours. I was done. I did an update to my review, and my 3 points that I feel kill the game for me stand. They are: 1. Performance and bugs. Whilst performance had improved on the graphics side, over 250k pop my PC would start suffering from repeated stuttering. This was simulation, not graphical. The list of bugs is massive. Just look at the confirmed list on Paradox forums. 2. Lack of content. The extreme lack of content is really disappointing. Obvious hat tip to DLCing us to hell. Yeah, there's a content creator pack of some couple thousand assets coming for free, but I would put a hundy on it that the original point of that pack was to introduce paid-for curated special content on Paradox mods. But they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants and giving it for free now. 3. Design choices. There are lots of design choices that just simply don't make sense.  It was at this time that I posted a new thread on Paradox forums outlining the above, and that I was putting the game down for now. Shortly after that thread was posted, I found myself banned for a full month. I have read carefully the code of conduct, the infraction matrix, and also the support page on forum user rules. I cannot see anything I could have legitimately been banned for. I can only think it was because I have been vocal in honest criticism (it's not the only time Paradox has been caught censoring their forums of negative feedback). Their code of conduct and support page also give you some instructions when banned. Contact the moderator in the instance, or if you cannot contact that moderator, email admin@paradoxinteractive. The irony is, when you are banned, you cannot access the messaging system to read the notice why you got banned. Nor can you reply to it. So I've tried emailing (politely) the email address a couple of times. I've had no reply. I don't believe I will get a response either.  So at this point, I am done. I feel that my feedback is not wanted, nor do they want to hear it. I believe that Paradox doesn't want me around, and I will just continuously be banned at Paradox forums, and if I continue to post here, banned here as well. I actually don't think this post will last long, but hey, let's give it a try. I'll screenshot it and post it to my steam profile. Avanya can't get to me there. Hahaha.  I will never, ever, buy another Paradox product. My experience with Paradox in the past, and especially recently, is that they are a hostile, abusive company that will stop at nothing to suppress honest critical feedback that they believe may impact their shareholder profits. My belief that Paradox is an extremely toxic company has been reinforced with my recent interactions with this company. I will never engage with Paradox forums again. I will never engage with any of their product, or the products of any company that has an association with Paradox. I am completely done with this company.  To everyone I've chatted with here, go in peace and have some fun. Thank you, all of you, for the fun times I had here. Even you Stealthy, even though I still think you're a Paradox employee here to muffle out any negative comments. You never did answer my question, but it's okay, you're off the hook now.   My review: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998739866/recommended/949230 Paradox thread I got one month ban for: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/its-time-to-put-cs2-down.1608679/""  This is the state of CO and paradox as a entirety, this one persons feelings has everything I have to feel about Paradox. They have gotten to the point that they just ban criticism because its ""mean"" This game along with CK3 and Vicky3 clearly show that we are little more than cattle for PDX to harvest for money. Friends its time to retire from playing PDX games. Its been a good ride but all things must come to an end."
177621498,english,1,949230,"This game still lacks a lot of of basic things and feels unfinished. But I have to admit, I haven't played CS1 since I got this game. Overall, I like it."
185833970,english,0,949230,"I have never been so conflicted.  I have re-downloaded CS2 about 5 times now, compelled by the overwhelming amount of beautiful showcases of CS2 cities on r/CitiesSkylines. Every time I have re-download CS2, I am immediately reminded why I uninstalled it. I want to like this game, I love the realism of the graphics, the animations of the sims, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and of course the option to make an intersection into a round-a-bout.  Unfortunately despite all of these new features CS2 compares nothing to CS1, I must admit, I do play with all the CS1 add-ons and was extremely disappointed when I first played CS2 to see I could no longer make my own custom university, airport, or park. Even despite all the additional content of CS1, it still prevails as the better game. If not for it's lack of bugs and glitches, then be for the lack of malware issues.  Never before have I wanted, nor even considered writing a review about a game, not even my favourite games, not even the masterpiece that is CS1, but the existence of CS2 conflicts me. I want to like the game, I want to play the game, I want to enjoy the game, but yet I don't. As the sequel to CS1, CS2 looks amazing, and it's features and game play pull me away from CS1, but its bugs, glitches, and, lack of customisation push me into a weird spot where I can't bring myself to play either game, a feeling so weird, it compelled me to write my first and probably only review."
149758101,english,1,949230,"I'm gonna try to be genuinely honest here. The situation for the game is pretty nuanced, and that can be difficult to express in a time when everything needs to be a meme and/or the worst/best thing to ever happen. In short: you can buy the game right now and have a heck of a lot of fun, but the game might have gotten off to a better initial reception had it been delayed for another 6 months or so.  Pros: The game is a lot of fun at this stage, and I am so happy we already get to play it whenever we want.  1. What is here now is definitely enough to call this a ""full release.""  2. You can do a LOT, and you have much better tools out the gate compared to the first game. It's less finicky, while also more powerful, so it's a heck of a lot easier to reach a higher baseline of cool-looking cities. Can't overstate how much of an evolution this is. Examples: road tool is insane, zoning (and the way assets are categorized) gives you much more control, as well as more types of zoning.  3. Performance issues aside, the game is an insane visual upgrade. The game can look frankly shockingly impressive. This ties into the first point to make cities better-looking by default. In the first, you'd need several mods to start making cool cities. Not here.   4. The simulation is really hecking cool. There are some bugs, but in general the way the city works with individually simulated agents makes for a city that has sort of its own life independent of your decisions - all of a sudden, you might notice a lot of people have educated themselves and consequently want different places to work and live so you now have a bunch of other options to build different stuff. Cool! So, it needs a little bit of work, but it's absolutely mostly there.  5. Since everything is simulated, traffic is a lot better. Mostly, you're fine, and at rush hour you get some backup. That's pretty much it now.   Cons: there are pretty good arguments it could have been a) delayed for like 6 months or b) released as an Early Access product.  1. Quite a lot of small bugs. Whether it's education being unbalanced, commercial having weird import/export stuff, or garbage being handled oddly, there's stuff in the simulation that isn't working as intended, or is in need of further balancing. Most of the stuff is simply down to not having played the game enough before to notice, or not having enough time to fix it. I guess it's annoying if you sit and think about it, but not a single one of the bugs have really bothered me in a meaningful way.  2. Performance is bad, but Colossal Order have been very upfront about that from before the game was released. Some of the reporting on it post-release, however, makes it seem like they just didn't have enough time to finish all the work. For instance, the reports on wild amounts of polygons being rendered, the acknowledge (more-or-less) by Colossal Order about LOD work simply not being finished, or the broken effects (you pretty much need to turn some of them off.) You can ABSOLUTELY run the game - just check out the posted performance guides on which effects to turn off.   3. Compared to a very kitted up Cities Skylines 1, with all DLC and mods, you might feel a little restricted. If you've played it a lot you'll come across situations where you go ""what a great spot this would be for a custom park,"" or whatever feature from the first game's 10-year life cycle. If you've never played that version of the first game, you might come across situations where you're like ""so I just build more of mostly the same type of district?"" And...both yes and no. There is some challenge to be creative, but on the other hand that forces you to familiarize yourself with the tools at hand to get the most creativity out of what IS here. Your mileage may vary.  4. Bluntly, some things just make it seem like the game is like 3/4 finished. Why are there no unlocks past the half-way point of the development roadmap (small city-big city etc)? Room for future expansions, or planned but cut features? Who knows. Don't get me wrong, these are non-essential things, but the feeling is there after almost 70 hours in the game.  Taken as it is, you could argue they should've delayed 6 months or released into Early Access instead. But you can also argue that releasing it will ultimately make the game much better much faster by both a) making the developers accountable to the players rather than some arbitrary release date and b) giving them more feedback than they could ever need to improve the game. Is it a little cynical? Maybe. Did they coldly calculate that the short-term reputation loss would be offset by the longer-term improvements of both what the bottom line looks like for the fiscal quarter as well as the game itself? Also maybe, but don't they have a right to do that, and do we need to be maximally dramatic about it if that is what they decide to do? Looking at it coolly, it is a complicated situation for a company, and either way they would have gone there would have been pros and cons. I won't presume I'd know so perfectly well what would be the right thing to do for players, employees, publisher, and the company itself.  Furthermore, you could argue that the Early Access label brings with it certain connotations - a never-ending cycle of waiting for when the game is no longer ""almost finished"" and developers who just abuse the concept to avoid accountability or expectations of quality. Also, is it maybe not allowed to release something as Early Access, when it's already been marketed as a ""full release"" sort of thing? Heck if I know - I'm not a lawyer!  To sum it up: Issues notwithstanding, I'm super glad I'm playing the game now rather than in 6 months. I'm glad I get to play it in a state where I can expect what is there to be enough for a release, and don't have to think about what's a month or two down the line. As for the rest of it, I might feel a way about it, but ultimately I'll leave up to Colossal Order because it's their product in the end."
170579341,english,0,949230,"Ok, cards on the table, I was really excited to see the new release after so many years. But to our dismay, you have somehow ruined it in ways we did not expect.   Pros:  1. better graphics 2. cooler looking city services buildings  Cons: 1. Graphics have STEEP performance requirements.  2. A lot of terrain tools were removed.  3. even on a rig equiped with a ryzen 9 with the 3090 and over 64 gigs of ram, i lag down to 10 fps. 4. population 10,000 lag starts opposed to the 30,000 population that the old game allowed before lag started. 5. Chirper is replaced by radio that wont shut up. even when paused, i hear it. Dear devs, old chirper was annoying enough, but it astonishes me how you've found ways to make it worse. 6. Infrastructure buildings became MASSIVE. so massive in fact, that instead of adding public transport as a feature to your city, your city is a feature of your transit buildings.  7. you can no longer tell where a majority of your path-finding is going on. in the old game, i could tell where a lot of vehicles were trying to go, so i could optimize. here, its all guesswork. not fun. 8. no access to the steam workshop, however you did add your own store so that people who had their mods here, lost their traffic.  9. money. no matter what i do in this game, after SO long with the first one, i cannot for the life of me stay in the green. No amount of tutorials, even COPYING youtuber's ""successful"" cities. i always find myself needing to take out loans.  10. lack of road options. I want a 6 lane avenue with bike lanes and tram lanes for starters.  11. Bugs. i understand that games have bugs on early access, and really early years, but this is some Bethesda level stuff here.  12. you tried so hard to make a continuation of your game to make money, but you are driving away people because you provoke us to write reviews like THIS!   Fellow steam user, please give this game at least another year if not two before you buy."
177252074,english,0,949230,"As a huge fan of the first Cities: Skylines, which—despite becoming a classic Paradox DLC cash grab—still worked and worked well across the board, I had high hopes for the much-anticipated sequel. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Cities: Skylines 2.  The game is plagued by endless bugs that seem to multiply with every patch. Every ""fix"" only introduces more issues, leaving the game barely functional. The so-called ""Economy 2.0"" update? A joke. All it does is give you slightly less starting money, nothing more. The game has been out for almost a year, and we're still missing basic features like hotels. And when you ask about it on the forums, the developers respond with cheery emoticons, telling you to turn on developer mode and manually install them yourself.  Are you kidding me? You can't fix something this simple? Do you even realize that the only reason people didn’t refund your game in the first 20 minutes is because they trusted you? And what did you do? You slapped us in the face. Honestly, I feel like a clown for sticking with this mess for 184 hours, hoping you'd finally get your act together.  Screw you, Paradox. You've earned it."

Given your reputation and resources, it’s baffling that such issues persist. I expected better. This frustration makes me question whether game development is the right industry for you. Perhaps a career in something like insurance—less reliant on delivering a functional product—might be more fitting. At least then, people like me could avoid this level of disappointment. Please take this as feedback to improve, not just for this game but for future projects. Gamers deserve better.  Fuck you.  Sincerely, A truly dissatisfied customer"

148794737,english,0,949230,"Everyone already knows the performance is terrible, so I'll just share my experience so you have a further example to compare to. I have a 13900k, 64gb of ram, and a RTX 4090, playing on a 1440p ultrawide monitor. I got 35 fps at the main menu and in game on a brand new map w/o building a single thing. Turning off motion blur and depth field increased this from 35 to 50 fps.  Not a single other graphics setting changed the performance at all. I turned off every single setting I could or set it to the lowest possible, and still only got 50 fps.  This is impressively bad optimization, I actually can't recall another game recently where changing the graphics settings literally did nothing to fps.  Just stay away from this until they fix it."

I was excited to jump into Cities: Skylines II after hours playing cities skyline 1 on steam and my PS4, expecting an improved city-building experience, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and better option at building road (overall yes, more mechanism than CS 1)  what I got was a game that runs like a broken-down Porsche Mauser tank.  Let’s address the elephant in the room: Cities: Skylines II is horribly optimized. The fact that they list an RTX 3080 as the recommended GPU is ridiculous, frame rates are inconsistent, stuttering is constant, and performance tanks as your city grows. It’s frustrating when a game that should be about creativity and smooth management ends up feeling like an endurance test for your PC/laptop.  I was never asking for ultra-realistic, almost dull graphics. The original Cities: Skylines had a clean, semi-stylized look that made cities feel vibrant and inviting. Cities: Skylines II, on the other hand, leans too hard into realism, making everything look too muted and uninspiring. The lighting feels off, textures look muddy despite the “improvements,” and overall, it lacks the charm of the first game.  hard to enjoy when it runs so poorly, I really like CS1 the way the semi-stylized look....even though the animations were simpler, they had a certain charm that made the city feel alive. I like to see a dog turns into a car, I like to see thousand of people summoning their own car or bike after leaving stadium with angry after their team losing. It kills the immersion rather than enhancing it.   I find myself wanting to go back to Cities: Skylines 1, that's still something that CS 2 can't replicate even after 1 year, 3 months, and 23 days after release."

I put over a hundred hours in it, and I regret that. The bones of the base game are better than CS1, but it just needs more time in the oven and more features in the base game.  I also really resent that Paradox saw fit to release it when they did. It's emblematic of a company that doesn't respect its customers and willfully ignores what its devs are likely telling management."

Now, despite months since launch and several patches released, the game remains virtually unplayable. Patches meant to fix the game bring about other, larger issues somehow, and it remains painfully obvious that the developers had no business releasing this game when they did. Cities: Skylines 1 became popular in no small part due to the flawed release of another city simulator, and they apparently learned nothing from that situation. I cannot recommend this game."

150199704,english,1,949230,"A potentially great game which is hampered by issues with simulation, glitches, and lack of key features that should have been available from day 1. I still recommend the game, as there is no mixed/middle ground option, as long as one is aware of the game's shortcomings.  GAMEPLAY: Most features from base CS1 are back, together with a mixture of the old DLC content, and even mods, and some new great features of its own. There is a ton of content available, and this is where the game shines.  Building things is much more pleasant in this game than in CS1. No forced roadside requirement. Roads and tracks can intersect multiple other roads/tracks. Upgrading and adjusting roads is much easier. Electricity and water are automatically transported via roads. Adjusting intersections a la TM:PE is a breeze. Roads and tracks can be freely connected to city neighbors. Out of bounds intercity lines are now at the player's discretion.  Buildings can be upgraded via modules, a nice addition and one that quite likely allow for quite a bit of customization later on when mods are allowed - i.e. expandable train stations. Building scale is overall improved relative to the first game, though airports are still horribly undersized.  Maps are bigger, though like in CS1 only a fraction of it is available to the player without mods, and even then there are limits on the number of tiles you can buy. This is a drawback in my opinion, and at the very least the available area that can be bought should be fully available, if not the rest of the map.  SIMULATION: A mixed bag for me. In one hand, traffic is more random and when it works is more pleasant to watch in my opinion. There are nice new touches like seasons - though more control over them is desired - and traffic accidents.   In the other hand, the simulation is very slow, and things take long to progress, even at the fastest simulation speeds. Furthermore, AI vehicles leave a lot to be desired in many circumstances, for example, near highway ramps where they tend to all try to merge into the highway instead of exiting, at the very last second, causing huge backups along the way.  Another key issue for is the separation of residential demand into low/medium/high density. As a sandbox game, the choice of density should be left at player's discretion, especially when commercial and office buildings are not affected by this. In the current state that the game is, there is way too much low residential demand that never seems to end, forcing one to build swaths of suburbia, even if some or all can be replaced at later stages in the game.  GRAPHICS: I quite like the direction of where the game is visually going. However, the execution is poor in that visuals are quite ""grainy"" and pixelated, and can look downright horrible at certain angles and distances, even on the highest graphical settings with a good GPU.  SOUND: The radio with a mix of generic relaxing music intersped with newcasts and talkshows discussing minutiae in and of your city is back. Music is ok but bland, and overall rather limited in which it becomes repetitive pretty quickly. Personally I listen to something else in the background instead.  OTHER ISSUES: At the moment there is no official modding support, or a map editor included, and there is not a big variety of maps to begin with in the base game - only a dozen or so. There are already mods being developed and released in third-party platforms, however.  Furthermore, even when modding support does come in 2024, it will be limited to the Paradox servers, and there will be no Steam Workshop support.  Also, the game may suffer from occasional to frequent crashes to the desktop, so make sure to enable autosave, which comes disabled by default and is a source of grief to many people in the forums. Or at least save manually often.  SUMMARY: Cities Skylines 2 is a game that has a lot of potential but suffers from a rushed release. Updates will likely rectify many of the issues and the review will be re-edited accordingly. In the state that the game is now, and its price, I think is a decent game, and one that is quite entertaining if it runs right, but nowhere near its potential. 6/10  Dec 1st 2023 edit: reduced my rating from 7 to 6, due to finding out no official Steam Workshop, too frequent crashes at times, and quickly dwindling performance in very large cities."
150097125,english,0,949230,"ORIGINAL REVIEW: im sorry but such a basic feature like exporting cargo being bugged for weeks is unacceptable.   NEW REVIEW: game is still a steaming pile of shit even after a year of patches. at least you can kinda export cargo now   UPDATE: this game is now using AI to promote certain DLCs, shame on you Paradox, you keep digging your own fucking grave"
186291447,english,0,949230,"It runs better now than at launch but it still runs very poorly. I want to love this game, I have played over 200 hours but I would advise against purchasing it, the games performance, crashes, bugs, lag are still very frustrating even after a year of promised improvements. While the game runs better than it did at launch it has gone from unplayable to painful to play. The development focus appears to have switched from trying to fix the base game and to endless $$$ DLC."
170585435,english,0,949230,I don't care about the performance of the game unlike the majority of the negative comments. My complaints are entirely gameplay related.  1. Can't build rail bridges over ship routes in rivers/lakes. The developers had almost a year to fix this. 2. Game randomly crashes. No mods installed. 3. Simulation isn't what it used to be in Cities Skylines 1. 4. No steam workshop. Why not? 5. Tons of features in CS 1 that were cut out of CS 2. Too many to name.

192329091,english,0,949230,"As someone who loved the original Cities: Skylines, I came into Cities: Skylines 2 with high hopes. The first game had tons of content, and the Steam Workshop support made it even better. Unfortunately, this isn’t a review of the first game — and that’s where my disappointment starts.  Cities: Skylines 2 improves on a lot of systems from the original. There are some great quality-of-life changes that make city-building smoother and more modern. But even with those improvements, the overall experience feels lacking.  I pre-ordered the game and received 15 DLCs (I believe) as part of the bonus, but most of them are just building reskins or region-specific buildings that don’t add any real gameplay. It’s hard not to compare that to the DLCs for the first game, or the workshop where I could find similar — or better — content for free. What’s worse, the two DLCs I did buy for the first game (which added meaningful content) are completely missing in the sequel.  It’s hard not to feel like Cities: Skylines 2 was rushed out and monetized aggressively. Despite being out for a while, it still lacks the depth and charm of its predecessor. On top of that, I experience random frame drops and lag, even though my PC should be more than capable of handling the game.  Right now, I can’t recommend Cities: Skylines 2. If you’re deciding between the two, the first game still offers a better experience overall — even today. That said, I’ll be checking back periodically to see how it evolves. If things improve significantly, I’ll happily update this review."
186238355,english,0,949230,I have a love hate for this game. I love the mixed zones and all the great features we had to use mods to get in the first game.   However this game crashes all the time. And someone at the company operates with half a brain cell and thought we should leave auto saves toggled off by default. On a game that crashes. The constant crashes and that one setting alone makes me not want to play anymore.  I'll come back in a year or two when they've got their act together.
170116953,english,0,949230,"I have been trying to enjoy this game for a while, coming back update after update, hoping that the developers will have fixed some of the core gamplay issues, but whenever some seem to be fixed, more just pop up. I am tired of waiting for this game to be playable. It Isn't. DLC's i have payed for are being delayed and delayed and i am tired of supporting such an Incompetent studio. I don't recommend this game, because, ultimately, not once during my significant playtime had i ever thought that this borderline unfinished game has justified its pricetag. I am extremely frustrated with Collosal Order for continuing to promise to make the game more fleshed out, understandable, and enjoyable."
150958533,english,1,949230,"If you like city sim games, then this is an obvious choice. However, seeing as this is a paradox game I would suggest waiting a few patches, or possibly for a sale. You are going to be spending 100-150euro over the years on DLC anyway."

183592829,english,0,949230,"Jumped back in after a few months of not playing, started a city, played a few hours. Game crashed while I wasn't looking. No save game, no autosaves. Deleted.. Thanks for having a playable game months after release, am I right?"
149026228,english,0,949230,"Updated on Aug 29: The game is still in a bad shape, almost all the problems are still present, while the last patch was almost 2 months ago. There's still not much on the Paradox workshop due to the ban on external resources. Very sad.  Update on Apr 12: They could've just used the Steam workshop... Reinventing the wheel hardly end up well.  Update on March 11: It's been 5 months since the release and the mod support is still ""in the works"". I cannot emphasize enough how badly CO played their cards and all that expectation, hype, momentum, whatever has definitely died down. GJ CO and maybe I should check back in a year from now??  Update on Nov 1: - Radio is kinda boring and there's limited track list. Even worse the hosts give you straight up false info (power outage, no more water, etc). - Same thing with the Chirpy - Again, traffic AI is dumb! Sometimes they straight up ignore your signage, sometimes they just do the weirdest thing on the road blocking the entire street. Case in point: [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17l6sfu/radio_traffic_sucks_today_meanwhile_cims_hold_my/]see this[/url]   Update on Oct 29:  I have a 6950XT and 12900K, my profile has not updated to reflect this. Sorry if that confused you!  - If you are like me who hated the new white reflection/torn effect on the roads, do the following -- enable developer mode by adding ""--developerMode"" to your launch options -- load up a game and press Tab -- on GameRending > Shaders, disable BH/Decals/CurvedDecalDeterioration (credit to REV0 for this)  - The performance problem seems to be subsided after experimenting with the graphics settings. I have now ~40fps now, but it's only a 20k pop town so will see how things scales. Random stuttering still occurs.  - Traffic AI is actually kinda bad and borderline funny. Erratic lane merging, getting stuck on a roundabout, or 5-point U-turn on a street was often observed.  - I studied some issues in the game economy and the solutions are... uh.... quite not what I expected. For example for the ""Not Enough Customers"" issue, it was advised to tear down its neighboring business(es) until you roll into a biz that happened to use what that shop is selling. For example you can have a Food company with not enough customers, and you should keep demolishing its neighbors till you get a Restaurant company that turns Food into Meal. Problem solved. Or is it???  - Likewise ""Rent Too High"" issue is because my citizens are lacking education etc. to find a job to afford the rent. Despite I have a number of schools all the way from elementary to college. I built buses to facilitate transit. Nope still not enough people literally are broke they can't even afford ""Low Rent Housing"". Guess the game is telling me I need UBI in the city?  And before you asked, yes the game does feel like an upgrade from the first iteration with many much needed changes and QoL improvements. However I do have high expectations from the CO and I hope these issues are rectified before I can wholeheartedly recommend the game.  Do I like the game? Yes but only because I loved CSL 1. Do I recommend it at this stage to anyone? No.   ================================= I really, really, really wanted to like it - but the game could use much needed improvements right now.   Issues includes the following: 1. Performance. The latest 1.0.11 patch did enable ~80fps in the main menu, but in game it's still around 20-30fps. Worse still the game now is stuttering very bad when I pan the camera, which didn't happen with the original release. This made the game literally unplayable for me post update.  2. Tutorial could be made better and more accessible. As of now it doesn't cover basics well enough, and as a CSL1 player I got confused with some aspects still.   3. Rent too high? Not enough customers? Buildings getting abandoned? I have no clue how to solve them and the game isn't exactly telling me how to solve them either.  4. Bugs especially how terrain and buildings/roads interact can be funny.  5. Not mod ready still :((  I will come back and revise this review should anything improves."
150075326,english,0,949230,"- Horrible performance - No variety in terms of assets (mostly buildings) - No mod support - Progression seems odd - Balance issues (economy broken; education broken; import & export broken) - Lots of graphic bugs (clipping, flickering) - Traffic Ai stupid - Zoning System also stupid AF - Can't turn off Winter. It sucks."
182527436,english,0,949230,"So, it was buggy before. crashing after quite a while of playing. Now, with the latest update, it is not starting at all"
175234987,english,0,949230,"I spent most of my time in the game trying to work around the bugs, but I give up. In a city of 400,000 citizens, only 1 or 2 use the international airport. Subways have thousands of citizens, but only a few actually board the trains. Only 30 passengers use trains, and half of the cargo trains transport 0% of the cargo load from nearby cities. Tourism is completely broken—no visible tourists, zero hotels, and so on. It's fun to start the game, but once you reach a population of around 100,000, the bugs drain the joy from what could have been an amazing game."
178407194,english,1,949230,"The potential is here for CS2 to become phenomenal. And although I do enjoy playing it, CS1 still has the advantage given the amount of time that has passed allowing there to be a plethora of updates, DLC and mods available for it. CS2 still has some distance to gain in those respects, but definitely don't rule it out. As the devs start matching the features from CS1 as well as building new features and in-game abilities, CS2 will be quite the superior city builder. I can understand the mixed player feedback right now, but watch this space."
174837542,english,1,949230,"Devs are paying attention and fixing the flaws from launch. Might have taken a bit, but its getting done. Runs better, far more content. Feeling encouraged about where its supposed to go next."
168892554,english,1,949230,"Cities Skylines 2 has had a bit of a rocky start, and I believe it's due in part because of Paradox probably pushing to get CS2 out earlier than it ought to have, and CO being the victim of its success with CS1 that it's set expectation way into the stratosphere.  That being said, with the release of the Economy 2.0 and the now additional assets just released, I would say if you've been on the fence about getting CS2, then I think now is a good time to get into it.  CO have been working hard on getting optimising the performance. They have listened to the community and have retracted the beach property DLC and incorparated them into the main vanilla game instead. They have reworked the economy which is a welcome change and actually makes the game a challenge and fun to play. The newly released assets are fantastic additions that now allow me to build smaller communities, and cul-de-sacs!!  The game still has more promise. When CO release a working version of an asset editor, this game will explode with potential. There's already some fantastic modders and content creators who are able to make truly stunning cities.  If you're happy to mod your game, and are into high level detail, then I advise you check out Sully's youtube video on detailing Snowdonia. It is utterly breathtaking. This is what I wanted from CS2 and Im glad we have it.  I'm not one of these people who set unrealisticly high expectations. I knew full well that any base version of  second game will be a rough diamond. Much like CS1 was when it released. CS1.  Very much enjoy this game."
163329170,english,0,949230,"Logged in today to find content I'd previously paid for, gone. So... while I've been perfectly happy with CS:II up to this point, I am now contributing my negative review.  At this point the game doesn't even run reliably anymore. I start it. It crashes. With or without mods. So fucking dumb. The whole point of this sequel was to integrate some of the improvements CS1 saw in the user mods so that we had a more stable game base to play with.   That's not the case at all here. This is just a rebranding. It's barebones play that still relies on user mods to make it a functional game. Most of my recent time 'in game', is spent troubleshooting. At least the last 20 hours."
175366797,english,0,949230,"It was one of the few games I was really looking forward to and bought it day one. It was disapointing launch and I didn´t play it for awhile. but somehow playing it now after multiple patches and fixes it feels even worse then launch. Expenses seem unreasonably high, graphics look cartoonish and washed (streets and houses look flat and bland), industry makes no sense and there is a feeling that there is no life in the city, just random cars and people. There is a high demand for high residencial, but no demand for shops or factories? Makes no sense. You need to have car access to park? Why? Garbage piles up so fast in 10k population city. No bike roads, electric cars and busses have no impact, people complain about noise when living in downtown area. Game crashes frequently. FPS has improved over the updates, but still its nowhere near acceptable for a high end PC."
149650170,english,0,949230,"When they announced that the game would release with performance issues I was ready to refund it if the performance was truly bad enough. Gamestar magazine provided a savegame on release to test for performance in the late game. I tested the game using that savegame and found the performance to be good enough. After getting my own city to ~230k pop 50 hours into the game later, this still holds true.  There are so many things I love about this game. They really put a lot of love into the road building tools compared to CS1, I love how for example single lane highways connect into multi lane highways, or roads of different sizes connect into each other in general. I love how trams work. I love how footpaths work. I love the upgrade/feature system for customizing road sections. And we even got surface level subways in vanilla now! I love the detail that went into the economy. I love all the pretty little details you can spot when you zoom in. And I can clearly see that the devs had a lot of great ideas for this game and in a lot of places put a lot of love and effort into it.  However it is also clearly visible that in a lot of other places they didn't get to finish their work. Be that minor visual stuff like some kinds of parks or buildings not properly reacting to the weather and season like other things do. Missing animations for emergency vehicles. Or the fact that many of the systems are just completely bugged. Like the infinite garbage import that completly breaks your city in the late game. Or that they gave us so much to micromanage, but no way of getting any data, statistics or overlays for some of the things you could really deep dive in. Why can I not see the profitability of my individual public transport lines? Why can't I see wether or not my bus line is actually being used at night? Why can I not see how many vehicles I have in my depots vs how many are in use at a glance? Why is there no overlay to see where certain resources are used and produced? Why can I not manage import via cargo trains/planes/ships better? Why can I not see the origin and target location of cars/trucks/pedestrians on the map by simply clicking on the to get a better overview over where my traffic actually comes from? There are so many things that can be micromanaged but there is simply no data to base my decisions on other than clicking and tracking everything by hand. And in the end there is no real point in micromanaging everything in the first place, because the end game economy is basically just having infiinte money regardless of how much I manage my economy until it all falls apart because somehow the entire planet sends me their garbage for processing and my 10 incinerators, 6 recycling centers and 3 dumps are immediatly filled to the max, even when I have twice the amount of processing needed to process my own garbage and my entire city drowns in trash. I really tried to love this game and building up my first city really was a lot of fun. However I'm at a point where I see no point in further improving my city any more, because at any point the garbage problem or something else is gonna ruin it completly and all the improvements I could make don't really matter in the first place. And I see no point in creating another city, just to get to the same point.   When they announced the game would release with performance issues they didn't lie, but they forgot that the rest of the game isn't really finished either. And for a successor of the first game, it really needs the endless replayability, that just isn't there right now. It's not a bad game, but it is incomplete. This game would have needed another year of development or so, but sadly that just seems to be the industry standard now."
173755312,english,0,949230,"BACKSTORY I bought ""Cities: Skylines II"" knowing that the public's reception of the game has been largely negative since its release. I eventually decided to try it out for myself—to form my own opinion. The first game, ""Cities: Skylines,"" was great. I immediately fell in love with designing, building, and optimizing interchanges. After years of play well-supported by both the developer and an incredible modding community that furnished a robust Steam Workshop, the game began to show its age. Enabling a handful of specific mods became standard practice, and certain shortcomings that neither developer nor modder could overcome were revealed. This showed the community that there was room for a sequel of sorts, a second iteration of the game designed from the ground up with certain improvements and capabilities in mind.  Among the aforementioned mods were ""Move It,"" ""Network Anarchy,"" ""Precision Engineering,"" and ""Traffic Manager."" The tools and quality-of-life improvements these mods provided players in turn provided the developer a starting list of features the sequel should include.  MY EXPERIENCE To the developer's credit, many of these improvements made their way into ""Cities: Skylines II."" From a road-building perspective, the underlying code for how roads are managed seems to have received a nice rework and the game has some great new methods for constructing intersections and the like. Sadly, some of these features lack refinement. Some cause glitches while others simply don't behave quite how one might want. For example, connecting two roads *can* work out nicely, OR it can cause the steepest mountains (completely impervious to terraforming tools) to erupt from the median reaching for the heavens.  FINAL IMPRESSIONS All of this leaves the player passionately yearning for what is clearly possible, yet heartbroken seeing it left just out of reach. I think the game has great potential, but lacks polish. It feels unrefined and incomplete. I'm confident the playerbase will create mods to help, but the game will never reach its full potential without corrective action from the developer.  It is also worth noting that a newer, well-spec'd gaming laptop struggles at times to handle the game in its current state. I get the impression that the game is not optimized very well. For reference, I have been experiencing issues while running the game on an ""ROG Strix SCAR 16 (2023) G634"" (Product Name: G634JY-XS97) (SKU: 90NR0D91-M001B0).  Now, I, personally, am left with the decision between requesting a refund (before I sink too many hours into the game) and keeping the game (relying on the developer to fix it). Ultimately, I will likely keep the game in hopes that my purchase will help fund an effort to improve the game. However, if I was more strapped for cash, I would undoubtedly request a refund. At this time, I would recommend anyone tight on funds to abstain from purchasing this product."
175264664,english,0,949230,"I spent hours and i mean hours on a city nd detailed as much as i wanted just for when i saved it, it completely froze my whole computer, and when i refreshed my pc, the save file for my world just disappeared like it never existed. I dont think i spent so much time and effort onto a city before just to lose it all. I would recommend this game but dont take it serious as any bs could happen. I might not be able to get the motivation to play again after this."
172054722,english,1,949230,"Good city builder but good god this game is poorly optimized. Be prepared for lots of sudden FPS drops. The economy and detailing updates have made it worth playing, although I would recommend picking it up on sale."
176459748,english,1,949230,"Recently started playing again after barely playing since launch. This game has its problems, but its still fun to play. While it is missing some features that were present (and highly useful) in the first game, the new features from this game like mixed/medium zoning and the road building are very fun to play with. The graphics improvement is also noticeable if you have a good enough machine to take advantage of it. It still isn't perfect, but this game has come a long way since launch."
190898660,english,0,949230,"Can you please stop releasing new content and fix the game, this new patch has literally done nothing to improve gameplay/QOL. Its getting embarrasing now. Still not playable! Traffic is still Mayham, cars have no real life direction"
175839538,english,1,949230,"I guess putting in 130 hours might be a sign that I really enjoy it... and I do! It had a rocky start with quite a few bugs that needed to be ironed out, but now it's much more playable, especially since the 'high rent' bug has been fixed. I do wish there was an option to toggle off icons in general—maybe there’s a mod for that, though I prefer playing unmodded for now. There are definitely some features from the first game that I wish would make their way into this one, like toll roads, and it would be great if disasters were made even more disastrous.  I like that they’ve made this version more challenging compared to how it felt at launch. Initially, it felt too easy, and I advanced through all the milestones quickly. However, what I still don’t like—and maybe I’m just bad at it—is dealing with traffic. No matter what I try, I can't seem to fully eliminate it.  If you enjoyed the first one and are still on the fence, I think it's time to jump off and give this one a try."
148945025,english,1,949230,Yes there are some performance issues but the gameplay itself is really enjoyable and big upgrade from first generation game. Although bike lanes etc are missing at the moment.
162377447,english,0,949230,"I am sure that this has been repeated ad nauseam in the reviews for this game, but if it had not been for SimCity 2013's disastrous release, the degree of popularity that the Cities: Skylines franchise has attained would simply not exist. One would think that, nearly on that game's tenth anniversary, it might be in mind for executives when determining a release schedule for their game.  Why did Cities: Skylines 1 succeed where SimCity 2013 did not? Simply put, it was unlimited where SC2013 imposed limits. There are many examples of this that you have probably heard before: community content, map size, one-way roads, yada yada. Why is it, then, that some the very things that helped spur the popularity of CSL1 in the first place not the first priority in a full new release?   This is all stuff you've heard before. What I have not heard nearly enough people talking about is that this game seriously lacks charm compared to its predecessors. I admit this is quite subjective, but hear me out. Like it or not, the donut vans and obnoxious sirens of the first game are iconic and goofy, and felt like they gave the game a charming identity; an unrealistic identity, perhaps, but it had spirit. It also had outrageous ploppables, like the Hadron Collider, in case you wanted to embrace your unrealistic side. SimCity 2013, lest we forget, had quirky thought bubbles, a poorly-disguised advertisement for Progressive Insurance, the 100% Electric Nissan Leaf, the whole future expansion that changed literally every zone?? and, on a more sincere note, the most fitting music for a city builder that I've ever heard, ever. There's a reason why the SimCity 2013 music pack for CSL1 was popular (no shade intended, that is hard to follow up). What is the identity of this specific game? Spasm Electronics?  I will give credit where credit is due. The road system of this game is vastly improved over Cities: Skylines 1, as are the building and vehicle models. I prefer the zoning categorization in this game, as it is a major step up in realism. The North American style does feel pretty American (anyone remember Roads United and that whole fisaco?). Roundabout support is very nice. The tree growth and seasons are nice, and adds value to every tree you place down.   The developers of this game are good people and I believe that they wanted to make a good and fully fleshed out game. I believe strongly that they just needed more development time to create a proper sequel, or they needed to release this game in early access, like many others have already suggested. One day I hope to revisit this game once it is in a more playable state, but I am worried that it will never get there, for me."
174677705,english,1,949230,"It is already a very good game and has tons of potential. I think it already surpasses CS 1 and is getting many updates, which is great from the devs. Despite the terrible launch, it has recovered very well and is set for many great things in the future."
148873180,english,0,949230,"Tough One  Long time CS1 fan but CS2 leaves me feeling both impressed at how much the engine has come on and disappointed at how much has been lost.   Firstly kudos to CO for at least warning us that the game was un-optimised, but, looking around at recent history should have told CO that this was an opportunity (However annoyed it may have left fans) for them to delay this release by a few months more to get it into a fit state.   After 15 hours of playtime on the sequel I feel confident enough (With a city of 110k) to review the game fairly.   So firstly the pro's  + Game engine is much improved, buildings look better, animations are much better (For the most part)  + The sims feel much more alive, you see them travelling and periods such as rush hour are now accurately reflected as opposed to CS1 where roads would grind to a halt anytime of day, which leads on to... + The road layout tool is vastly improved, at first it may look like its a simplified version of what we had in CS1 but there are powerful tools underneath the initial views that allow you to control many more aspects of the road layout, the AI also uses roads in a much more common sense way. changing lanes and trying to avoid jams + European and North American options for the most part (Apart from low density habs) look sufficiently different, although things like trains and some lorries are not localised with big old american trains for cargo spoiling some of the immersion  + Development points is a win, replacing the standard unlocks as you grow your city you can now select particular buildings or service in the order you want to, it makes for different playthroughs and options each time and gives you more control over areas to focus on in city development, a major improvement over CS1 + Slightly stolen from the last Simcity but the ability to upgrade existing service buildings is a welcome addition, rather than having to plop 10 different small police stations across your city you can now typically get away with one or two and simply upgrade them with larger garages or improved services. The majority of the time its cheaper than buying a new building and increases the coverage area, which reminds me + The service coverage area for most service buildings is far more generous now, gone are the days of having to plan to build 3 elementary schools all within the same area of your city because of their laughable service coverage zone. Service buildings now cover significant parts of the map. I did the earlier to mid-game with the very first police and fire stations you unlocked until I got to a pop of around 25k, impossible in CS1 without the city resembling a Friday night out in Essex  Now the negatives - Its day 2 of release so mods will come but right now the game feels sparse, minimal buildings and options for many of the different types of service such as schools and police means once you've unlocked one or two lines of each services development section you've pretty much seen it all,  I'm really hoping those of us who invested heavily in DLC for CS1 aren't going to be stung by countless additional DLC that simply should be in the base game to start with. Its pretty weak currently and once you've unlocked most things there isn't a great deal to do beyond continuing to grow your city with the same buildings - The game should have released with the creation kit and mods good to go. If they can bung free copies to 'influencers' to try and butter us all up over the last few weeks they could have done the same for the actual valuable members of the CS community aka the modders. It would have left the launch feeling much less sparse. On the subject of modding, i'm not precious about steam workshop or their own version of it, I would have just liked to have seen mods here at the start to make up for the lack of content  - Pathing whilst vastly improved is still an issue later in city growth. get above 80k pop in a decent size city and regardless of improving your roads, the AI seems to have a fit and forget all of the smart stuff its been doing up to this point and rely on the same core roads and pathing as opposed to the countless other options I tried to put in place for them to use. Which reminds me...  - Public transport feels generally broken at the minute. In a city of 110k I have 1% using buses (Despite very generous spreading of stops across my city, 0% using trams, 1% using the subway and 0% using my passenger trains. Seems pretty pointless, very expensive and totally contributes to the snarling up of the road network. Definitely contributes to the end game making you feel like you are just constantly firefighting the road network than actually city planning and needs to be patched urgently - The UI is pretty awful, everything from setting bus lines to the size of menu screens and the lack of customisation around being able to move with the mouse all feels weak at the moment and less than what we had in CS1. Its frustrating when you are laying out a transport line and suddenly a menu pops on screen and deletes all of the progress you've been making laying out your line. - I'll talk about optimisation more generally below but stability wise I've had one crash (My rig details below) but most important point here, for some unknown reason autosave is switched off by default, which in a game like this where hours of work could be lost to a crash seems insane to me, make sure its the first option you switch on and to the devs I'd strongly urge you to have this switched to on by default.   Optimisation  Ok, the big one.  Firstly kudos to CO for admitting they had a problem, but that admittance should have led to them doing the right thing for their customers and delaying the release, but hey, we live in a shareholder driven world so needs must I guess.   Optimisation is extremely poor depending on your hardware choices, what this means looking at the steam hardware survey is that 99% of people will not have a game that feels next gen when they play. CO have themselves advised switching off a bunch of graphical options to get a decent framerate and whilst this isn't Call of Duty where frames = better, the standard in 2023 should be having the game run at a minimum of 60FPS for the VAST MAJORITY of users. This unfortunately won't be the case for many many people.   So, things to make your experience more stable (if less pretty)  - switch off depth of field - 10-20 FPS improvement - switch off Vsync - same sort of frame gain as depth of field - try flicking between borderless window and fullscreen, some are reporting frame gains of between 5-10 fps - run it in 1080p if you have to - can give you 20fps or more - switch off all of the volumetric options - 10-20 fps   All of the above is obviously dependent on your own hardware setup but on mine (I-9 12900k, RTX 3080 TI 12GB and 64GB DDR5 RAM i've been seeing a stable(ish) framerate of 68-85 fps with a pop of 110k running in 4k.   Your own experiences may vary and i'm not disagreeing that some folks with better hardware than me are having a worse time than I have and this simply reinforces the point that optimisation does seem to be all over the place at the minute.   In summary though, its not good enough, when people with £5k rigs are having to switch graphical options off for a game that isn't a FPS, then something is quite clearly badly wrong in how its been built and delivered to its users.   The hope of course is over the coming days and weeks the game will be patched. But that still isn't good enough for a £41 game that many folks have been pre-ordering and building up to for most of this year. Sure it would have been annoying to delay it by another month or two but it would have earned CO a significant bit of kudos and support from the community rather than the review bombing and open hostility we have now.   In summary then, its ok, but for those with weaker rigs, avoid for now and wait for patches to come. I'm pretty disappointed"

Since the beginning I've dealt with periods of desktop crashes, thank goodness for auto save. Then we'll chug along for a while without crashes. New update comes out, crashes return. Now I get some system log error every time I boot up the game. I've read forums, I've combed through steam, I've uninstalled and reinstalled 5 times now - it won't go away. Supposedly there's a fix but you have to comb through a folder of never ending files, download additional software to identify the failure and then reformat the file. Look, I just want to play the game. I shouldn't have to become a software engineer to play  a game I spent decent money on. I don't know what's going on over at Colossal Order or Paradox, but they need to get their heads out of where the sun doesn't shine. Both entities should be embarrassed. Hire people who know what there doing, make sure they care about the product that's being produced, and give us what we paid for."

The performance has improved greatly for me and so it's been worth it HOWEVER, I must have missed the memo about auto-save being OFF BY DEFAULT and lost 8 hours of game-play when it crashed. I hadn't had any crashes up to that point so I guess it was pretty stable. I do recommend the game but I think there are some really basics things missed. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
148958095,english,0,949230,"a great many reviews so far, both positive and negative, seem to center around performance. while it's definitely true CO shit the bed a bit here, for most people these issues are fairly surmountable (if not still having enough annoying present issues like stuttering for those same users). so i feel compelled to counterbalance that by listing an assortment of the the much deeper shameful issues/annoyances in this sequel  - the improved traffic pathing would really be more appreciable if the ""lifepath"" of cims seemed to matter all that much. there are distinct periods of high (rush hour) and low utilization, but in terms of actual behaviors, cims interact illogically (park at location very briefly before leaving immediately), sparingly, or often not at all - i know this is a complete rewrite of the game compared to C:S1, but how exactly did water physics manage to regress *this* badly? relatedly, don't waste your money on a hydro dam, as it appears to be wholly non-functional for power at this point... - ...or *do* waste money on your hydro dam because it actually doesn't matter—the game economy is opaque at best and non-functional at worst. i'm not sure if people are correct in reporting a *complete absence* of logistics mechanics, but it seems like colossal order have so little confidence in this area of the game that businesses/industries can get by on an excess of goods being teleported/freely spawned in their inventories while also potentially suffering from a lack of customers and continue for an incredibly long time without ever going out of business. i've seen a couple people successfully export goods, but most people report their air/sea/train cargo connections never loading a single thing, while other people report businesses that have no outside road connection whatsoever still remaining in business, so something is seriously broken in all of this. (also good luck getting your commercial plots to ever level up with their ceaseless moaning for customers) - you will frequently struggle to maintain a surplus, probably due in no small part to economic silliness. for most people, they probably are overbuilding services, but it is regardless more difficult than it probably should be. not to worry, though: CO have effectively papered over this by giving you particularly sizable cash bonuses every time you level up in the progression system. unless you've been running a deficit with no profits and few milestones for a while, you're unlikely to ever end up in a penny-pinching situation. this was also true to a large extent in the original game, but that was more because the economy was *easy* rather than due to it being fudged - dealing aesthetically with lots/roads on terrain in C:S1 was never especially fun, yet here we have also managed to regress massively from ""ugly"" to ""looks like a geometry error even if it's not"". actually, building on terrain has gotten worse mechanically in general as well. twice as many slope errors (and twice as easily/sensitively), quays/bridges yelling ""it's in water"" at the drop of a hat for infrastructure *literally meant to be proximate to water*, even if you get a road right on terrain there's a good chance you get stuck with a disgusting retaining wall setup, etc. - C:S2 got us all excited for increased ability to build non-car-dependent cities, in contrast to the original... then what we get instead (besides small ped paths that work similar to the original) is a single type of ugly, wide(!) pedestrian street that pedestrians don't properly utilize (maybe due to aforementioned issues with their day-to-day behavior?), but *CARS* DO LOVE TO UTILIZE (Lmao), especially if you zone commercial along it (like one normally would do with pedestrian neighborhoods). a lot of those commercial lots will end up being gas stations, too. i almost can't be mad at this one because it's so whimsical - further frustrating your plans for a beautiful ~modern and sensible urbanist~ city plan is the fact that it is remarkably difficult to ever push your cims into utilizing the public transit you very considerately built for them. not impossible, but far more often than not you'll see marginal utilization on decent routes. also, remember how i mentioned ped pathways/streets? in your quest to wean off car dependence, you won't see a single bicycle on said pathways. maybe that's just me personally taking offense as a cyclist, but it's yet another inexplicable regression from the original game - roads are, as everybody have noted, MASSIVELY improved in almost every practical way, yet often beyond what a seasoned player might expect. snapping is, all at once, too weak and too strong (depending on context). zoning plots becomes a planner's nightmare as you'll draw out a grid that is composed of perfect 90 degree angles and still get misaligned plots between the roads - expecting all DLC functionality to be in this as sequel is not realistic, but—i'm gonna use this word yet again—the absolute regression here in campus areas, park areas, district zone specialization (besides industry), etc. is pretty gaping - on release of the original basegame, the hyped-up ""district/city policies"" system was a little underwhelming as far as what you could really do with it (and it was only after several DLC that the policies menu had any flesh on its bones). it looks like an absolute abundance compared to the 6 or 7 policies they've given us here lol - i've made peace with the decision to not use steam workshop in favor of (still-unreleased) Paradox Mods but that doesn't mean i don't still think it's stupid and as an imposition upon this game it's just another feeble gasp from the increasingly frail, wheezing body of paradox interactive ever since they went publicly-traded - other cosmetic gripes. there isn't even a tasteful fog to obscure how ugly the borders of the playable map are. all vegetation and any non-sea water (like rivers and lakes) suddenly, visibly do not exist beyond the playable boundary, as do roads—they couldn't even bother with something that kind of resembles a road going off into the distance. the really funny thing is, i've seen (on the Tampere map at least) that trees *can* still render beyond the playable area and some scatter into it for tree clusters on the borderlines. they were just too lazy to add any garnish to this area otherwise. which doesn't really make you want to make use of the nearby playable area lol - death by 1000 cuts. so much across both major and minor functionality is either practically inoperative, fairly broken, or at least a little broken/unbalanced/inconsistent, including: > postboxes don't really seem to work. the postal system does (i think). just not postboxes. there's a lot of issues in other systems that are flat-out silly just like this > road-naming and what the game considers a distinct road is all screwed up. i've had entire grid neighborhoods have 80% of said grid's roads considered one contiguous road. and if you build off a road, you never know how radically the game will shift what it considers to be part of the old road or a new road entirely. custom road names are not protected in this process and you will lose your custom names extremely easily. at this rate i'd rather just pretend road names don't exist anymore and hide them, but hiding labels is not an option (which it was in C:S1) > seasonal cycles cannot be disabled and you cannot simply go to a climate that does not have seasonal cycles, because all maps/map themes are in temperate northern hemispheric climates anyway. your winter wonderland will quickly become a snowy nightmare"

The game is boring.

148820365,english,0,949230,"Sadly this review is negative.   The performance is just unacceptable, there are some rendering issues plaguing the game, and on top of that there are some wildly unoptimized assets in this game.  From small guard shacks with modeled out wires, computers and keyboards to the horrendous looking procedural generated citizens that far exceed even some larger buildings in triangle count, they are a waste of computer resources.  The whole unecessary addition of a ''citizen lifepath'' is something very few players asked for, and its clear part of the issues with this game relate to choises made during development of the game.   The truth is, these citizen models look so hideous that they dont even invite you to engage with the lifepath mechanic at all, id rather have they were significantly reduced in detail, or replaced by assets modeled by an actual artist, and not a procgen program, before i would consider paying attention to the ''lifepath'' stuff this game offers.  I wanted to love this game, and in a way i still do, everything else Cities Skylines 1 did is improved in 2, but the terrible performance, and questionable looking assets really ruin the hype for me.   Also, this game has a launcher, and just like the 1st game, its totally unnecessary and offers no utility whatsoever, beyond serving advertisements to you for Nvidia.  This review might change to positive if the optimisation is adressed in the future, and the ability to mod the horrendous looking potatoheads is added..... Before then, if you are not brand loyalist like me, stick to the first game a while longer, this game needs a couple more months in the oven.  Edit: Further thoughts:  After longer play A noticeable issue is that Residential zoning demand is based on *density* not on *affordability*  Wealth does not factor much in where a citizen will move in as much as density type does.  This results in the player having to build an insane amount of low density zoning, even though denser apartment building types would be preferred and more efficient, limiting your planning abilities and creativity.  The game will complain about there being a ''housing crisis'' when the real problem is that citizens will not move into denser buildings.   City policies are negligible and can no longer be applied globally, instead having to be set per district.   Building upgrades are a great mechanic however.   Virtual texturing/texture streaming seems to struggle with alpha mapped objects (primarily hedges) causing them to look cubical with flat 2d planes sticking out of them. This happens even with less performance intensive cities.    Edit: Specs  GPU: GTX 1070TI  CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X   RAM 32GB  My settings: everything set to medium, disabled volumetrics, DOF and Motion blur. 70% resolution scaling.  Average FPS zoomed in: 30  Average FPS at range: 25/20   Population in city used for benchmark: 100.000"

156405585,english,0,949230,"After spending almost 150 hours in this game it’s safe to say I’ve given up.  I’ve mostly ignored all the comments at first so that I can give an impartial view of this game.   Foremost, Cities Skylines 2 is broken. It is riddled with many serious algorithmic and performance bugs that affect core functions of the game. Widely reported bugs such as frequent crashes and taxation glitch, which causes unexpected income and deficit spikes that breaks the gameplay — and this is just one of many serious ones out there   While it is understandable for bugs to be present in games and software, Colossal Order’s lack of urgency and genuine interest in tackling bug reports makes it unacceptable.   It’s been 3 months since launch, yet recent statements from the company were deliberate in evading questions on roadmaps for bug fixes, and attempt to obfuscate users by saying that something is being worked on for the near future.   Hard to believe that this is the same company that made Cities Skylines 1 — a realisation of what the company once was. For now, stay away until more is done.   —  (Quick update — 29 Jan)  I’ve given this game another shot with a fresh install and a new city — issues remain and let me summarize my experience  - At first glance, Cities Skylines 2 provides many quality-of-life improvements compared to Cities Skylines 1, such as better road building and modern assets.  - You’ll find that it is now a breeze to build roads, highways and intersections, tools are intuitive and easy to use. Want an intersection? Just drag across an existing road and you’ll have an intersection. Want a roundabout? Just plop it down.  - Assets are refreshed as compared Cities Skylines 1, gone are the cartoonish buildings and vehicles.   However, most of the gamebreaking issues start occurring as you progress into the game.   Game stability and optimization - As your population increases, game simulation will slow to a crawl — despite my setup being well above the recommended specs  - Occurs on my two different cities and save files.   Service Mechanics - Garbage management and healthcare vehicles will regularly depart from their facility and return almost immediately (alerts will popup frequently that healthcare and garbage management is inadequate despite well within their capacity) - Buses, trams and trains will frequently and randomly despawn or stop working completely.   Economy and industry - Taxation for industries will become highly erratic due to an algorithmic bug, taxation income will fluctuate randomly by the millions for a town of 10k citizens. Completely breaks the budgeting and financial system.  - Local industries will not export goods, cargo terminals (both air and train) will hoard all mail and breaking the mailing system (also impacts citizen happiness) - As confirmed by many others, due to a land value bug, prices will increase to astronomical levels, which makes residential suitability zero for most parts of your city and its outer suburbs.  - This the most critical bug since it completely stops the progress of your city and game, as residential demand will be zero, and no new citizens can move in.   These are just some of the numerous bugs I came across while playing this game —  you do find yourself having to look up online for any workarounds whenever you come across one.   While I’m almost certain that these issues will be addressed eventually in the future.. but is this what it is expected of a published game that cost $50? Was this game ready to be published in the first place?   After two gameplays and two cities, one thing is certain for me — Cities Skylines 2 would not have passed QA and should not have been published in the state it is in. This game is in beta."

I love how the genre evolved over time and the games became more complex and at the same time more rewarding.  It's my idea of a perfect saturday afternoon, sitting down, listening to some chill music, and watching as my planning unfolds into this megalopolis that was in my head.

We decided to purchase the top package that guaranteed us the most bang for our buck and the not yet released but announced DLCs that would add stuff as we started a new city together.  We stayed home on game release day to make sure we were among the first to download and start building our new shiny city together.  Much to our dismay however, the game was slow, clunky and basically unplayable on a Threadripper 3960X w/ 128GB Of DDR4 and 2x RTX 3090's.  We were sad to say the least, but we still had hope.    People started sharing settings, then official announcements came with other settings, and we finally stopped having 13fps and got it up to 30fps.  So it was playable, right?  Well, not really.  There was still masssive stutter from time to time, especially when inside of game menus... I mean, they're menus, why on earth are they causing the FPS to plummet and dropping dozens of frames?  It was, and still is so bad, that it randomly causes the USB to reset and the famous Windows chimes that tell you when a USB has disconnected, and reconnected play through the speakers.  And then a patch was announced that promised to fix some of the biggest problems with performance, so we stayed home again, only to be let down once again.  There was maybe a 5 percent performance increase overall, and the menu's were still causing massive game lag.  CO admitted fault and released patch after patch after patch in quick succession, that we were overjoyed that soon we would get to be able to enjoy the game...   But that time never came...    CO stopped patching, but promised that they would not release any of the DLC and more paid content until they got the base game right, because that is what was most important to them...  Another promise... another let down...  Now, not only did they release a paid DLC before fixing the game, they had to gall to charge $9.99 for it.  Bare in mind here, I paid for the deluxe edition, so it was ""free"" for me, but it also let me know how much extra I would really be getting for the extra money I spent, and it doesn't seem like much...   If I had one piece of advice for anyone looking to buy this game in its current state, it would be to run, very fast, in the opposite direction of your computer screen...

159724986,english,0,949230,"Cities: Skylines II - the game where everything is made up and nothing matters.   Its the game equivalent of the DJ pushing all kind of buttons on his mixer that is not plugged in while an mp3 just plays on his ipod.   Do not spend money on the game in its current state if you expect a city builder that actually simulates the behaviour and movement of people and  goods. Right now the game is just a tool to build something that looks visually like a city but has no inner logic or function. People and vehicles are just animated background noise. Their behaviour barely influences any important metric and all your game play decisions don't influences them alt all. A few examples:  - I build a ore mine on an island with no road connection. Before i could even finish the passenger ship connection there are 60 workers employed at the mine that must have swam over there. I finish the ship connection but not a single physical person steps onto the island. Looking at the stats the mine is producing a couple hundred tons of ore per month. Not a single truck moves anything out of the mine to the cargo terminal.   WHY DO I BUILD A PASSENGER AND CARGO CONNECTIONS WHEN PEOPLE AND PHYSICAL GOODS DO NOT EVEN NEED THEM?? IN A CITY BUILDING GAME THAT IS ALL ABOUT MANAGING THE FLOW OF PEOPLE AND GOODS???  - Because the animated people and cars/trucks that you see in the game have absolutely no influence if your city works or not all your game play decisions have no real consequences. You would think if you build a shitty city where people are stuck in traffic and cant get to work there will be a negative consequence. But because the person doesnt need to be physically present at work it matters zero if you build a highway from their door to the office or have no physical connection at all. There is no motivation to do anything because there is no consequences either way.  - The people physically present in the game do not behave in a way that is understandable. You click on a random person just getting of the train leaving the station to find out that they are going to work on the other end of the map where the train just came from. because there is no way to show the actual path you have no clue why they took the train away from their destination.  - even if we ignore that the game has no internal logic and rules your still building ghost towns. my current build of 10k people looks like a big city with highrises and all but there are maybe 1/10th of the actual people around. no real traffic problems because there are very few cars around. If you think that is because of public transportation think again, busses trams and co have mostly 1 -5% utilisation. The industry that is on paper producing thousand tons of goods have the occasional truck driving around.   - rush hour does not work at all. All streets have a graph that shows the traffic flow over the course of the day and every single road has a flat line that does not vary depending on time. If you have only every tenth person on the road at least have them leave their house all at the same time.  In conclusion I'm very disappointed that they spend so much time to develop a super complex ""simulation"" and then decided that non of it actually matters. It feels you are looking at a animated picture of a city while there is a complicated excel spreadsheet  on the other monitor crushing random number and they hope you are dumb enough not to notice that they have nothing to do with each other."
181467107,english,0,949230,"To put it fairly, Cities: Skylines II isn't bad because it's abandoned or given any false promises. But rather, while there is indeed significant effort after release to fix and improve the game, the disastrous release has still left mountains of problems unresolved. And now while the game is probably at 60% confidence for [i]release[/i], it's already resuming selling cosmetics for coins, which is why I have to add a thumb down to it.  The disaster of CS2 is a combination of over ambition, terrible risk management and project planning. This game was built on weak foundations and has been heavily misdirected to keep stacking on it - namely, the economy simulation.   CS2's key feature and improvement over CS1 is the much more in-depth economy system with individual level citizen needs and more types of supply & demand. The bad news is this system has never worked. They started with embedding fake dummy figures to make it [i]look [/i]functional, then, after being picked out by players, reworked the math two or three times (I lost count if we are at economy 2.0 or 3.0). [b][i]It still does not work. [/i][/b] And more crucially, players have little to no way to make it work.   There are only very limited micro management tools which makes 80% of the stat charts in the game pointless - you can stare at them, but there is no way to respond to them. What's the point of having dozens of industry types when I can't even assign a district or building to a specific industry? What's the point of having a patch to ""give more salary to employees"" instead of making it something adjustable (e.g. minimum wage or income tax rate) in the first place?  CS2 essentially introduced an overly complex model to replace what's trivial but working in CS1, to achieve the exact same goal - to generate district demands - but failed to provide enough tools to players to integrate it as part of gameplay. There are so many gaps and vacancies between this simulation and the actual gameplay, that are either reserved for DLCs or simply overlooked. However, instead of filling the gaps by providing more policy tools,  more specialized city service types etc, the devs have only been cooking and recooking the math of the simulation... which is quite pointless.   This makes CS2 not qualify for a city simulation game. It's at best a [i]scene building [/i]game that is no way worth $40. Adding on with the performance downfalls, the modding dramas, and the unending list of [i]small [/i]bugs - all lead to the very same question: [b]why would you release the game in 2023, if it is still not ready after one year?[/b]"
160957874,english,0,949230,"I say this with no hyperbole, this game is so bafflingly bad it arguably has destroyed Colossal Order's reputation.  Cities: Skylines 1 arguably revived the city building genre and was a critical darling. It had flaws, but it was at its core a product with legs and heart behind it, and its community was well earned.  Cities: Skylines 2 feels like a cheap mobile game, like World Box or something, where you just place objects and get pretty views.  On the one hand, a lot of people play Cities as more of a model set rather than mechanical game, so in some ways Cities 2 is 'better' because you can get a prettier view... but the default assets often are very repetitive and you can't currently mod in anything to get variety or to customize your city, and many of the mechanical aspects of the game dramatically interfere with making a city that looks just the way you want it. So while you can get some good shots that look sort of like a real city, you can't get some of those magical moments you can in Cities 1 where you set up everything juuuust right and have created a city of your dreams.  So the game launched without real custom cities, but it could lean on its simulation aspects... if it had any.   Cities 2 promised to up the fidelity of the simulation to, frankly, silly and unbelievable levels. I never believed you would really be able to follow individual cims and see that they have a cohesive life, so the fact that doesn't actually work is fine. The idea of trying to accurately model and track literally tens of thousands of interacting agents is stupid.  The problem is almost no simulated element actually works. Cities 1 took a lot of shortcuts for its simulation, but it had an internal logic that made sense and facilitated the core challenge of a city builder: conflicting needs of different types of activity in a city putting pressure on your ability to lay things out and connect them, because while things didn't have formalized connections, you still had a clear logic of what sort of resource would be demanded by what zone you plop, and where they were likely to come from. Did it make sense that the industry building that was nominally making phones would receive raw meat and then ship out their finished products to a commercial building that was a donut shop? No. But on the macro level you understood that resources need to go to specific refineries, which then go to industry zones based on distance, which then created abstract goods that needed to get to commercial zones while generating traffit.   Cities 2 has a detailed economy that tracks companies, specific industries and supply chains, supply and demand, production, ect... and... it doesn't work. Its a downgrade from 1.... because goods just teleport. You literally don't need to do anything. The game has all these bars and graphs that SAY 'X industry needs more ore products' but you don't actually need to ensure they can get them, and that makes sense because you can't actually set up things on that specific industry level anyway, so even if the system worked it would be a nightmare... but instead it just doesn't work at all and you can just toss anything anywhere at any time and basically not care because people and goods can teleport in a game primarily about connecting zones.  This isn't even going over bugs like with education. The core concepts of Cities 2 don't really make sense, which is why I am not surprised they are fake, but its baffling that in a game for simulation nerds they would ship something so transparently broken and non-functional and worse than 1... when they could have just made a simulation like 1's with maybe more detail on industries, better road making tools, and the new density system. Its just so confusing why the game is like this and why they just made something that doesn't work, and never likely will work.  Just play Cities 1."
149590916,english,0,949230,"Beware: traffic simulation, economy simulation, and sim life simulation are not designed to work together   Bought the game. Performance issues, not a big deal, it will get sorted. Playing along, about 15 hours in you realize the ""deep simulation"" is fake. Initially I realized there was a cargo bug. Nothing was getting exported via harbors or train or air cargo terminals. Although that itself was bugged, it revealed a HUGE issue that was put in by design. Turns out, the traffic simulation, the economy simulation, and the sim life simulation are all not connected to each other, which makes them all not really impressive at all. Sims have jobs, but don't actually have to go to work. (Same with school) Businesses need goods to operate, but don't actually need them to be exported or imported by the road system. You can have an industrial zone without any connections to the outside or the rest of your city and the economy side of things will work without issue via magical teleportation of goods and workers, in a game that is supposed to model traffic and ""create rush hours as your sims go about their lives"". Uhh, yeah, sure CO.   ""deep simulation"" they said over and over again.  I feel deceived on this one, and quite frustrated that I didn't realize it was all disconnected until past the refund period.  What the heck CO, I expected better than this.   Feels like they couldn't get it all to work together and just released it anyway. Or the marketing team and the development team never talk to each other. Wow..."
188693448,english,0,949230,"Over 1 year after the release: - Still tons, tons of bugs?✔️ - Frequent unexpected crashes? ✔️ - Zero compatibility with mods? ✔️ - Still no proper modding tools? ✔️ - Unbalanced economy and population, terrible pathfinding? ✔️ - Zero optimalisation and incredibly high graphic requirements? ✔️ - Still a small portion of content in the SEQUEL, compared to the 1st game? ✔️ - Releasing paid DLC's to an unfinished and almost empty game? ✔️  Dont buy it, by any means don't do it. The game is in a pre-alpha version compared to what should have been and will be for a long, long time given the current ""development"" progress  ❗️❗️❗️ 24/03/2025 UPDATE because I want to address some of the comments and also mainly because I'm genuinely getting even more pissed off with this game, every time I'm getting back to it.  🔴 Regarding some most usual comments, @qG_CeRTiiFieD and @Saukuy already addressed them in the below section, so I will just paste them here. If there's a way to pin them or anything please let me know, so I can give more credit to these guys:  ""They're still working on it."" -It's been a year after release. Stop giving companies grace for releasing broken products. YOU are the reason why they keep doing it.  ""Your PC is trash."" -First of all, doesn't at all address 6/8 points provided. And for the only two it MIGHT address... this is a commonly reported issue with the game. Talk about fallacy. - personally I just want to add, for comparison, that I'm running KCD2 or Cyberpunk smoothly on very high settings, whilst my recommended setings for CS2 are low/very low...  ""Why did you play it for 176 hours"" -90% of reviews are from people who barely get past the introduction and then provide poor unhelpful feedback that doesn't actually tell potential users anything of note.  ""Try not comparing a ten year old game's content compared to a one year old game"" - All about the value proposition. If the game doesn't adequately innovate mechanics, while also offering substantially less than a previous iteration - what is the point of getting the new game?  🔴 As for the things that I have ommited previously and that make me pissed off even more (even though the game is objectively getting better of course):  - I can't stress it out enough how terrible the pathfinding is.  - Poor graphics - I mean honestly, the game is newer, but is it really better looking? Grass textures are hideous, we have cartoonish cars, bland and simply sad colors and design of many buildings. CS2 was released the same year as Baldur’s Gate 3, Hogwarts Legacy, Alan Wake 2 or Lies of P. Would you have guessed it? Absolutely not, UI is better and it's easier to build things, but that only distracts from the simple fact that the game is ugly. Jesus, compare it to Manor Lords...  - Texture clipping, uneven road zoning, incomprehensible downcasts or road shading, misterious holes in the terrain adjacent to the structures, in other words dozens of minor errors that you spend a solid hour trying to fix because they sting your eyes and you'll go crazy until you fix them  - Lack of many tools that would mimic CS1's absolutely essential mods, like Traffic Manager or Intersection Marking Tool for example. Jesus, we still can create much better organised and more detailed intersections in CS1 than here. How they couldn't simply include at least the first 3 pages of most popular CS1 mods in the new game? The receipe for a success was so simple...  - Still no bikes, quays, just a few types of roads and intersections etc. - again, JESUS CHRIST IT'S A SEQUEL AND THEY CUT OUT SO MUCH CONTENT, THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.  - Related to the previous sub-item - promenades? PAID DLC. Almost any leisure and entertainment? PAID DLC. A few modern buildings? PAID DLC. Any region pack, after adding just a few most basic ones? PAID DLCs.  Disgusting."
180847633,english,0,949230,"City Skylines 2: A Huge Step Backward!!!  I’ve been a dedicated fan of City Skylines 1, pouring over 1,200 hours into that game and thoroughly enjoying every moment of city-building and management. Naturally, I was excited for City Skylines 2, and despite the initial mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance. After spending 250+ hours trying to immerse myself in this sequel, I can confidently say it’s been a MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Last night was the FINAL STRAW. I played for about 4 hours, carefully building my city and manually saving my progress multiple times to ensure nothing would be lost. Yet, during my final save, the game CRASHED. I didn't check the game archive at the time, because that's the kind of thing I'm USED TO. (Well done, City Skylines 2 team—you’ve successfully conditioned players to lower their expectations and tolerate glaring mistakes as if they were just part of the package.) When I reopened it today, all my save FILES were COMPLETELY GONE. Everything I worked on vanished as if I had never played at all.  For a game that demands long-term planning and hours of investment, technical issues like crashes and save file corruption are UNFORGIVABLE. This is basic functionality, and the fact that such issues persist after the game’s launch is UNACCEPTABLE. While City Skylines 1 felt polished and reliable, its sequel feels like a rushed, buggy mess that UNDERMINES the player’s TRUST and PATIENCE.  Unless the developers address these critical issues immediately, I CAN NOT RECOMMEND City Skylines 2 to anyone. It’s A HEARTBREAKING STEP BACKWARD from a franchise I ONCE LOVED."
154958535,english,0,949230,"The game needs to be better optimised and grinds to a halt when you get a few hundred thousand population.  So many people saying ""but CS1 took 7 years to get to where it is"".   Then I suggest you don't buy this until 2031."
150341735,english,0,949230,"Hmm this is going to be a tough review.  Much like everyone else I was very excited by the game when they announced and showed it.   When I first starting playing it I was enjoying my time with it but as the hours rolled by I think for me at least for now I can't recommend this game in its current state.  Man I wanted to truly like this game and sometimes I still do but well...  A decent amount of the core features are improved, The graphics, style, road placement and management and UI but at the same time there is also quite a lot missing, barely improved or outright worse or missing.   For starters the game is buggy, certain systems don't quite work or are planned out poorly especially the import export stuff. Then there is performance.   Some people may excuse it but I for one certainly can't. Having personally worked in the Unity ecosystem for 5+ years I can personally say they dropped the ball here. The graphics are great, Truly but the design and optimisation is going to take a LOT to fix an I feel bad for the engineers behind the scenes.   As a fan and customer I personally feel there no reason this game should barely be lucky to hit 30fps at low-medium on the best system costing thousands of dollars on the market especially when in a lot of areas the overall simulation while mostly better then CS1 its not that much better tbh.   This is made even worse when you realise most of the maps lack a LOT of details that were in the previous entry including grass of all things.  That is not okay and other details overall you will find its just missing or lacking overall,   The service vehicles don't have animations, there is less variety to all of the npcs and AI compared to the first game, Everything is sadly very static in regards to the ""world"". Most of the AI is just going from A to B and you can't even see the direct path they are taking unlike the first game which makes management of traffic more annoying then it needs to be especially for a sequel.  I think pets work now, Pretty sure I've seen dogs clocking in or walking home which can be more easily noticed once you hit 100k civs, which yknow honestly is just a hilarious bug.   I have three civs in my city which have been standing still since 20k and are now old people, One of them fucking died and whenever I want a laugh I just check up on them. It is another funny bug.  Pretty sure dogs at launch floated as well.  A lot of my very smooth roads have clipping issues into the void below on the sides of them an issue I don't remember being present in CS1.  I found it really tough to make my city look and feel unique outside of tree placement and road and terrain layouts because the detailing is a feature that not only hasn't improved from the first game but is seriously much worse then CS1 and overly lacking.   From a distance everyone's creations look amazing but when you zoom in aside from the awesome sense of scale which is a positive here in a massive way everything is the fucking same and it just sucks. Somehow less variety then CS1 at release side by side which makes no sense.  Like fences really? I can't even place fences? or quay walls which were in the first game, I can't modify existing details within buildings? or rocks and benches, I can follow an NPCs ""life path"" but god forbid I wanna actually make the houses they live in somewhat unique outside of naming with the same or similar tools the devs used to make them.   There is also very little in terms of variety for zone types which is kind of sucks considering this is suppose to be a sequel and placing specific zone types at times can be very frustrating, Like sometimes a certain house type will spawn for 99% of an area then for whatever reason wont for no real reason, Don't like it? Just remove the roads and start over and hope it works for the 2nd time or 3rd.   Also no idea why a plopable Rico isn't here in the base game. The assets are there, LET ME CHOOSE THEM PLEASE.    As time has gone on I have found myself finding more things that are were present in the first game but for whatever reason are not here or worse many things which are not improved at all.   For a sequel this really only has minimal major improvements of the first and the things which are improved they can't really make up for what is either worse or about the same as the first game..  Lane management is barely improved and its very frustrating to say the least combined with the traffic AI.  At low pop its not so bad and honestly seems alright and they even have working suspension a cool small detail however once you get high up there the simulation starts to break and brain of the civs just goes out of the window, Its like suddenly at 60k and above everyone decided booze were for everyone!   I spent more time stumped at how brain dead the AI overall can be before attempting at trying to fix it.   I had massive traffic jams stretching for miles with my interchanges barely being used. When I zoomed in they were all turning last second in multiple lanes, Some would do U-turns sometimes more then once and just cause chaos which for me at least is made even worse as IRL I'm learning to drive right now and the AI is making decisions I don't think I would ever make in a car even if I was 10 years old. Its insane!   Not to mention services, I have found the new feature of making them district restricted quite useful which is a positive but it still hasn't fixed the AI, A dead person is waiting for transport right across the road from the cemetery... WHAT? They are lucky that meteors can't be thrown willy nilly like in CS1.    I think this needed at least another year in the oven and if that wasn't an option early access at discount, Would of been better for the brand, devs and community.  That isn't the worst of it though. For me its how they have responded the community initially and how they made sure to tell the creators before release not to mention the performance and giving them weird restrictions. They knew exactly what they were doing and did it anyway. From the announcement of the hardware requirements going up hidden in a larger message to banning a long time community member for valid criticism.   I think in time they can turn it around, They did pretty good with CS1 and I think fully realised that games potential to the engine and design limits. Here I think the concept is good its just the execution. The bones are here for a great game. A lot of the core systems are in place begging to be polished or in quite a few cases outright fixed especially in regards to the overall simulation and I do love the art style more this time around although more variety is needed. What I have experienced so far overall I can see the potential down the line but for now it is just not here yet sadly.   The more I play this game the more depressed I feel about what could have been yknow?.   I love some parts of it but some other parts I just loathe and get annoyed. I'm currently trying to make a very realistic city and I'm running into so many design limitations with the current tool-set compared to the first game without mods it just kind of sucks.   I overall feel very mixed. At times it can be really great and chill, Other times it can be the opposite.  Hopefully they can improve the overall performance, Fix all the major bugs & at times broken simulation, Add in the missing features that were present at the very least from base game in CS1 at launch and MAYBE just maybe we will have a good start to the sequel for DLCS, Free patches & overhauls for many years to come.  If you want a proper sequel look elsewhere or come back in a year. Its a fine game overall even with the issues just don't go in expecting greatness, Some parts or better, Most are the same and some are worse then the first game.  It isn't worth the full price, Not even close, 40 AUD max, 60 AUD with the extra content. 5/10 (great potential) ~ SirJarko  Maybe in a year it will be worth it? Lets hope"
171930650,english,1,949230,"[h2] Intro [/h2] While I really enjoy the modern take on city building, Cities: Skylines 2 falls short in several areas I hoped would be improved from [i]CS:1[/i]. Although some features have been enhanced, many aspects feel very similar to the previous installment. Below are my thoughts, the good, the bad and the ugly!  [h3]Passing Thoughts[/h3] If you’re wondering whether it’s worth playing at the moment: [b]Yes and No.[/b] If you’re looking for a modern city builder and don’t mind some rough edges, then yes, it’s worth trying. However, if you prefer a more polished experience and want to wait until the issues are resolved, then it’s best to hold off.  [h3]The Good[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Engaging Sim Life:[/b] Just like in [i]Cities 1[/i], watching your sims go about their daily lives is a pleasure. The new feature allowing you to track a sim throughout its lifespan is a welcome addition. [*] [b]Improved Road System:[/b] The revamped road-building tool, including slip lanes for highways and dedicated turning lanes, is a significant improvement. While these features could have been added via mods in [i]Cities 1[/i], it’s great to see them included in the base game. [*] [b]Enhanced City Services:[/b] Power, water, and sewage now travel underground, eliminating the spaghetti-like pipes of the previous game. Additionally, there are more city service buildings available, offering varied services to your sims. [*] [b]Expandable Buildings:[/b] Many buildings now come with extra modules to increase their capacity. For instance, schools can be expanded with additional buildings, which reduces the need for numerous schools and service buildings as seen in [i]Cities 1[/i]. [*] [b]Mixed-Use Zoning:[/b] This feature, which I wished for in [i]Cities 1[/i], is now officially supported in [i]Cities 2[/i]. [/list]  [h3]The Bad[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Stagnant Gameplay:[/b] The game doesn’t evolve with city size. Managing a small city feels identical to managing a large one, unlike other city builders that offer varied and evolving gameplay. [*] [b]Lack of Challenges:[/b] There are no significant constraints or meaningful decisions. Problems are typically solved by simply ""building more,"" making the gameplay feel repetitive and flat. [*] [b]Limited Improvement:[/b] Although certain features, like highways, have seen improvements, fundamental issues with the grid layout and overall gameplay remain. These issues appear too deeply embedded to be resolved without a major overhaul in a future installment. [/list]  [h3]The Ugly[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Modding Platform Shift:[/b] Moving from the Steam Workshop to a third-party [i]'Paradox Mods'[/i] platform is a poor decision. Despite some solid features, this change detracts from the ease of modding that the first game provided. [*] [b]Poor Aesthetics: [/b]The grid-based design and focus on American urban sprawl lead to bland, unattractive cities. Specialized industry zones and modern industry representations are particularly weak, resulting in uninspired city layouts unless you sacrifice density. [*] [b]Bugs:[/b] The game still has several significant bugs, even after recent patches. For example, homeless people may remain indefinitely in your parks, which detracts from their intended use and overall enjoyment. Although the developers are aware of this issue, the lack of progress in addressing it is concerning. [/list]  [h3]Is It Worth It?[/h3] I wish Steam offered a middle-ground review option, rather than just ""Good"" or ""Bad."" While I enjoy the game, it remains quite rough around the edges. If you can tolerate some bugs and occasional issues, it might be worth trying. However, for most players, waiting [b]6 months+[/b] is probably the best option. Although I believe the game will have a long lifespan, I’m concerned that its poor initial reception might impact its future."
159365546,english,0,949230,Holding out on content so they can drain us of our money with DLC. The scheme is so played out now a days.
169445745,english,0,949230,"So this is from someone who played CS1 both modded and vanilla, with access to the DLCs (some features of which should have been in the base game, and others available as working mods from dedicated modders).  I would not recommend this game in it's current state, as it is buggy and does not work once the zombies take over (Note: This is not a zombie survival game).  UI			 	Roads will glitch when creating intersections, offramps, etc. (which is probably why they recently released a visual ""patch"" that allows adding pavement, etc.  	Your processing speed will slow down every time a zombie is created. How is a zombie created you may ask? Simple, if you purposely (or accidentally) destroy a building that houses any amount of people, those people will walk out to the street and just stand there, looking for a new place to live. But, since you most likely have an outside connection (*I even tried without an outside connection, still broken) those ""available"" homes will be taken by new people, and thus a zombie is created as ""Moving in"" or ""Idle"", if you destroyed a commercial zone, you create ""Shopping"" zombies. These citizens will stay in your city and slowly eat your processing power until your game speed of 3 is 10 minutes for an in game day to pass. Unsustainable, and game breaking (only the first of many game breaking issues with this game).  	Sometimes the weather works, and other times it does not and just ""glitches"" to the next day when it is sunny again.  Traffic			  	The AI doesn't respect lanes (no surprise that the AI still does not work when it comes to traffic), as they will turn in no turn lanes and do six to twelve point U-Turns wherever they can, multiple times. This is more common if you add or remove a road *anywhere* in your city, and it also happens when you add a sidewalk or crosswalk. This common task causes the AI to ""re-think"" and recalculate it's route, which causes them all to ""shift"" their routes.  		No individual lane control which means the dedicated turn lanes are determined by the angle of connecting the side roads, and a matter of one pixel will determine what the lanes do in response. Also, the traffic signals and signs are ""node"" specific, so there is no way to put a stop sign on just a sidestreet, etc., this was ""fixed"" in CS1 with mods.  	Cargo train stations are broken, they will not deliver goods between cargo stations, cargo airports, or cargo ships, and goods that are created locally from industry go no where, and commercial starts importing everything individually anyway, causing your industry to basically do nothing but create pollution.  	No weather related buildings (Heat, ice rink, sowplows, etc.), as they probably want money from a ""Snowfall"" like DLC from CS1	  Power/Water			  	Combustion banned zones should have increase power consumption, and there are no charging stations for EVs, only gas stations for fuel, ""Green Cities"" DLC?  	You can start a map importing power, but not water, so if you want to export water from the beginning tile you cannot (only for those that play with just 1 tile...)  	No water removing services, so enjoy those floods when you make a mistake.  Population			 		GAME BREAKING bug that I have no idea how it made it out of QA and passed Dev...zombie homeless just stand on the road taking up processing power, although some of them become homeless people that pay taxes and ""work"" but don't move into an available house or move out of your city (or actually ""go"" to work), and eventually become zombie robbers that kill your city...as mentioned earlier. This breaks your game in 1 way or another, I still don't understand how it made it out of Dev and QA and was released in this state. It is incredible how little it seems CO/Paradox cares anymore... 			 Healthcare			 	No deathcare	or childcare, probably want money from a ""Sunset Harbor""	like DLC from CS1  	The aforementioned zombies still negatively contribute to the overall health of the city, also killing your city, and when they get sick or die, healthcare and deathcare cannot ""pick"" them up so you get stuck with symbols flashing on your screen on of sick and dead homeless.  School			  	There are no preschools (or daycare) as mentioned earlier.  	No law school or dorms, probably want money from a ""Campus Life"" like DLC from CS1.  	More people ""stuck"" in building then ""eligible"" to be there, zombies live in schools and other buildings so even if a certain amount of people are eligible to go to school, they can't because every school is completely filled, until you have a map that is just elementary schools.  	Educated sims still become Robbers at an incredible rate, and soon you will have a city of Well-Educated Homeless Robbers who are Happy and Wealthy. Good luck getting rid of them, no amount of taxes or lack of city services will deter them.  Police 			 	Well, the police are currently broken as they cannot ""arrest"" homeless robbers, and since there is no way to control patrolling or set up stationary ""standing"" locations for police vehicles, 3 police cars will drive around chasing 1000 criminals in a town of 500 people, causing the crime to kill the city. At least my police helicopter flies 10 feet south above my river on it's routine patrol, just to turn around and land. Also fun to watch my 3 police cars drive into a crime scene, look at the robber (or group of robbers as the AI just stand there) and then drive away without making an arrest. 		 Fire			  	A waste of money being ""on"" all the time as they don't help with traffic accidents or house-calls for EMS, or hospital, etc. Can just turn it on when a disaster strikes or a fire starts, but other than that it is super expensive to do very little. 			 Parks			  	No ""Parklife"" benefits, i.e parks built on sidewalks, etc. Also, no amusement parks, zoos, aquariums, etc. because, of course, they probably want money from a ""Parklife"" like DLC from CS1.  	No ""professional"" sports	 stadiums (which I believe was actually free from ""Sports Venue"" DLC)  	Trees are easier to plant, but can no longer ""clean"" polluted ground, and do very little, if anything, in stopping noise pollution.  Disaster			  	When an area floods, there is no way to remove the water without destroying buildings and using landscaping tools to ""push"" the water back. Cars will just drive through it, zoneable buildings will ""build"" underwater staying in a permanent destroyed state, and other buildings will just stop working unless you notice the water surrounding it.		  	Only tornadoes and forest fires (every 10 minutes or so, without fail), and no disaster routes or control of the shelters that are available, probably  because they want money from a ""Natural Disasters"" like DLC from CS1.	 			 Zones			  	No real district control, as there are laughable amount of polices (that do very little, imo).  	No historical buildings (no way to ""save"" a building model you like to preserve it)  	No hotels/motel/gas station manual control, even though it is purposely built into the Economy 2.0, again things that were basic in the ""After-Dark"" (Leisure and Tourist spec, etc.), ""Hotels & Retreats"" and ""Green Cities"" DLCs.	  	No ""industry zones"" which means no control of what ""companies"" move in, even though this is a big deal in Economy 2.0.  No way in vanilla to even see company info.  	No standalone warehouses or industry/company specific warehouse control to pick from, again because ""Industries"" DLC	made this available in CS1, another paid DLC.  	Zoning ""too much"" will create broken empty buildings, common in industry creating ""warehouse"" UI models, but no company will ever move in, or houses that remain empty even though homeless people are looking to move into a house (or college kids moving out of their parent's house live in a park or become a zombie instead of moving into one of these buildings), or you will get 5 of the same company in a row (or 5 gas stations, albeit different companies) in a row, or very close to each other."

Unfortunately, that led to my first-ever malware after 28 years of PC gaming, all because CS2 lacks basic protections—like two-factor authentication for mod uploads. Thankfully, the malware seems to only target crypto, which I stay away from, but that risk is too big to ignore. I am done with this game, and don't know if I will be back."

161134221,english,0,949230,"Half a year has passed since the game's release.  I've been patiently hoping Colossal would fix their game, and didn't request a refund when I had the chance. That was a mistake. Several months in, they still haven't fixed glaring optimization issues, or their simulation engine. Opening the game to see 20 fps in the main menu or on an entirely empty map on 3080ti was a very special experience.  Since then, in response to well-deserved constructive criticism regarding the game, the developer just showed their belligerence and tried to wrap it as ""playerbase's toxicity"" instead of fixing their barely functioning game, or coming up with excuses in line with ""if you want better performance our game might not be for you"".  Stay away from this game, it was released in an alpha state and has not been fixed ever since. Instead, their resources went towards paid DLC content."
158262106,english,0,949230,"I’ve liked playing Cities: Skylines 2 so far. It’s definitely an enjoyable game, with a lot of promise. That being said, the game does not get any points for being “enjoyable” and having promise. The bar was much, much higher for this game  While it’s not fair to expect CS2 to be as feature rich and polished as CS1 is, so close to launch - it is fair to expect it to be fully functional to the extend we were promised from marketing.  I can forgive the lack of assets. I can forgive the bugs. I can forgive that we were told that the game would initially launch without mod support and that mods would no longer be run through the Steam workshop.   But more than 3 months after release, Colossal Order has not been able to deliver timely updates to fix numerous bugs, let alone deliver features that they promised. Mod support and console release keeps getting delayed. Performance has been getting better but it is still an incredibly demanding game for what it is.   In 2023 and now 2024, the sad reality which I’ve come to accept, is that games will be released with bugs - lots of bugs. What is completely inexcusable is that they are no longer pushing updates for bug fixes/patches independently from DLC launches. Major patches will now be released alongside paid content.   In 2 years I’m sure this game will be better.  But CO deserves a negative review until then; this game should be marked as early access and its price should reflect that. Do not buy this game until then. You’ll have a better experience buying CS1 + DLC and modding it to your liking."

Not only are we paying to beta test this for you, you're releasing DLC instead of fixing this buggy mess? Shame on you for the scammy product, shame on me for buying the ultimate edition.

Every high-density office building looks like a 20-story, gray, concrete masonry column of sadness. So gloomy. So dull. [*] [b]The lack of assets creates a horribly bland experience.[/b] It's not enjoyable/realistic in a city of 100K population to have three different house models and 100 office buildings that look like identical gray Lego bricks. [*] [b]The game is unplayable over 100K population.[/b] Speaking of large cities, the gameplay and graphics come to a excruciating crawl once a city's population nears 100K. 5800X3D processor, 128 GB memory, and a 4080 card? Doesn't matter. Slo-mo everything. And that's with extensive ""performance enhancement tweaking"" of the settings. [*] [b]Industry doesn't matter.[/b] Importing too much convenience food? Well too bad because building more industry to produce it locally will only spawn another hundred stone mills so you'll have plenty of rocks being produced. Oh and deleting and respawning industry buildings does nothing except create more rock shops. Maybe after two hundred deletions you [i]may[/i] get a timber plant. [*] [b]What about industry taxes?[/b] Best to not mess with these. Going to 0% or even subsidizing industries to encourage production makes no difference. Also, random industries will create literally hundreds of millions in revenue or cause a deficit in the hundreds of millions unless the tax rate is set to 0%. [*] [b]Ok just import/export using cargo then.[/b] Not a chance in heck. Traffic gets so backed up at train/sea/air cargo stations that trucks despawn and nothing is picked up/delivered. Unless you build ten cargo stations across your city. [*] [b]But, just like in real life cargo stations will hoard local and outgoing mail, right?[/b] This doesn't happen in real life but in CS:2 it does. Once a cargo station of any type is built it will hoard all your city's mail rendering post offices useless as no mail trucks ever pickup mail from the cargo stations. [*] [b]Schools[/b] Elementaries are hugely comical in size. No one goes to high school. Everyone goes to college. [*] [b]Parks[/b] No one goes to parks except the homeless who setup camp there. And forget about building large, beautiful parks like in CS:1's Parks DLC because that was left out for some reason and we were given boring, generic parks.

156075470,english,0,949230,"To be upfront, I have only reviewed this game now due to their first press release of the year. I have complaints with the game  in general itself among other things, but the biggest thing I cannot excuse is how the devs repaid their loyal customers. CS1 was a near masterpiece and outside of good game development, the devs were loyal and friendly to their customers. CS was the only game I can think of for a long time where buying DLC, while costly at times, was hardly a second thought because it both added content and was repayment for how much respect we as customers had for them.  CS2 totally flatfaced most of us. I bought CS2 not too early after release and expected what something between what was written about it and what I saw in CS1. I quit playing 10 minutes in when my graphics were all over the place, didn't work half the time, and when they did I felt like they stepped down considerably from CS1. After a number of updates I played again after hearing it's better quality wise. My honest opinion on CS2 is it's not only unfinished in many areas, but in places the game has taken a one step forward, two steps back approach. Like special industrial zones changing and how they did was nice, but it felt off the mark in other places like with how unnatural the zones are and how not many people can even occupy that site as a job. And of course CS is a traffic heavy game, but CS2 traffic AI is beyond broken as even with perfect road design you will always see cars paralyzed by excessive yielding and cars wanting to turn into a turning lane so they can turn out of it at the next traffic light - and god help you if you don't yield to their wanton desires.  Overall there's a lot of stuff that should be in the game that isn't, stuff from the old game that should be (like what happened to designing intersections with stop signs?!) in the game, and buggy issues that have yet to be fixed. And with a game so close to modders, you'd think day one there'd be mod support. There are mods right now that could be here on Steam, that have fixed a lot of the issues mentioned, but aren't here because the devs have spent their time doing whatever it is.  At the end of the day I can at least move on and forgive knowing these devs since their track record with CS1 was great. But since CS2 the devs have seriously not only let down their fans but outright betrayed them. And now they've gone full out blame-game by accusing the fans - their loyal customers - of being toxic. They suggest just making honest critiques and making suggestions but then ban or delete anyone who makes them in the game's related forums for being toxic. I was originally waiting to see if they would fix more with the game before I left a review of any kind, but after seeing this latest toxicity accusation against us, I decided to join others who've left negative reviews in order to show the devs we don't appreciate being missled and gaslit about a game they should have had no issue releasing in the first place. I will only swap my recommendation if they apologize and fix the game seriously from now on. Until then I will continue to play since I have the game, but I will not buy anything else from this devs like DLC until they change their ways."
174951039,english,0,949230,"[b]I wouldn't say ""don't buy this game"": I just wish I hadn't bought it so that I could still enjoy CS1.[/b]  It's been a year since the turbulent release and except for resolved the critical bugs, the game is still not on-par compared to the first game's quality and content.  With regular crashes-to-desktops and game-simulation speed grinding down to a halt after 150K-200K population;   [b]there is no point in being creative[/b] (you're already unable to, since there isn't much content to suit your narrative yet) [b]there is no point in being expansive[/b] (because after some point, each simulation minute takes five minutes) [b]there is no point in discovering[/b] (because you cannot spend your skill points without an either-or question, it's never both unless you play with 'everything unlocked')  There [u]are[/u] improvements to the first game, such as mixed-zoning and road-building --which I'm also angry about because now I can't go back to the first game after getting used to the comfort of these newer mechanics.

The economy still doesn't actually function, meaning you will not see goods from your industries travel across your town; everything just teleports as needed.  Your finances make no sense because somehow you just get more money but cannot figure out where it is coming from, resulting in there being no way to fail. It's also great to see their CEO literally _lie_ about features of the game before release, and then _blame the customers_ when the reception to their half-baked pile of shit is poor.  This game is not only bad, it's literal consumer fraud. Colossal Order have burned to ashes whatever positive sentiment I once held for them."
149097733,english,0,949230,"REVIEW UPDATE: I am now at 85 hours. After learning the mechanics of how the simulations work, I will admit my original review is influenced by not fully understanding some mechanics. For instance, the constant low density residential demand.  Aside from bugs rendering whole chunks of the game broken, such as trade and garbage bugs, after 85 hours the biggest issues I have with this game are two-fold: 1. An extreme lack of content. Building (and farm) diversity is extremely lacking. I suspect content will be DLC'ed to hell, which I strongly oppose Paradox's DLC strategy of removing content to the bare bones and then selling it to players later.  2. Design decisions that just simply don't work, or don't make sense. For instance, pegging ""wealth"" to ""education level"". Wealth should be pegged to career instead. How off map city services function also doesn't really work. They work against the principle of building a healthy, functioning city. If you lack a service, it doesn't negatively impact your game, except that sims have a little less wealth as they pay for the off map service. But that's easily countered by cheaper taxes. Standard genre features like the RCI meter work differently to all previous city builders. Instead of showing what to build for a healthy city, CS2 RCI meter shows what the city wants (which most likely doesn't result in a healthy city). Design changes away from genre standards are fine, just make sure to include in game ways to let the player know what the change is from the genre standard.  Anyways, after 85 hours my final conclusion stands. I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2. Aside from performance and bugs, the game has very little content, and has design decisions that don't work, or don't make sense.  ---- ORIGINAL REVIEW: I tried to like CS2, I really did. I can ignore the performance issues and bugs, as these are things I see being fixed over the short term with some patches in optimisation. However, there are much bigger issues that you need to be aware of. The numerous simulations in the game have such foundational flaws in them, that I believe this game is the most fake city builder of them all.  This game is marketed as ""the most realistic city builder ever"", with multiple levels of simulation in the city, sims, economy, services, and traffic. Unfortunately, there are huge flaws in each are of the simulation.  After 20+ hours playing, aside from the known performance problems (which I've mitigated by running the game at lower gfx than I should be), these are the biggest issues I see:  - The economy is broken. Goods in your city aren't actually traded. Import/export don't actually do anything, so trucks deliver goods to your stores and train stations, ports, and airports, but the transportation networks never pick it up to deliver off map. Industry, commercial and residential don't use your produced goods. There is no cargo traffic in your city, because there is no simulation of producing goods, transporting them to your shops, and then sims buying those goods. It's all completely fake. Colossal Order have confirmed this on Paradox forums.  - The progression system is broken, just place a tourist trap and bulldoze it, repeat over and over. Level 20 without doing anything. Progression is not linked to population, just ""XP"" gained from placing stuff. Thing is, it doesn't remove the XP if you bulldoze straight away. As a result you can have a ""Flourishing Metropolis"" with 50 people. Each main step should have a population limit. IE: town 10k, city 50k, metropolis 100k or something.  - Most people don't actually go to work, kids don't go to school, people don't shop. You can track individual sims. When you follow them, they actually don't go to work. They will get in their cars, or walk to the tram or whatever, jump on, and then do a circuit back home. Or they'll arrive at work and get straight back onto transport again to come home. Kids do not leave the house. They will stay in their homes, not going to school. The whole rush hour thing is a joke. Basically, the sims simulation is..... fake. And this is the big ticket item that this game is sold on. A simulation of each individual sim, going about their world, doing what the do. Living, growing, prospering, dieing. All faked.  - The city only ever demands low density housing, never anything else. City of 50k, with very little office demand. Always, low density residential will be 100% demand. You can even buy 20 tiles, do a massive grid of low density residential, it'll all pop into existence and demand will still be 100%.  - You don't need to build any city services, it all comes in really cheaply from off map. It's cheaper to import all services, than to build the services yourself and pay for maintenance. The only exception seems to be power and water. You can export power and water for enormous profits.  - Maintenance and expansion is not balanced at all. For some buildings it's cheaper per unit to build a new one, and some are cheaper to just expand. For instance water pump: $10,000 to build 100,000 unit pump, and $7,000 to expand one an extra 50,000 units. Cheaper to make a new one there.  - The traffic AI is just absolutely stupid and retarded. I couldn't think the traffic AI could be worse than CS1, but they actually managed to do it. Cars will do u-turns in the middle of a highway. Cars will stop in the middle of the road, jump across 3 lanes causing a big traffic jam, just to reach a left-hand turn they go straight through instead. Opposing carriage turns (ie: right from left side drive, left from right side drive) will not wait till the approaching through traffic is clear. They will turn like it's the middle of Delhi and cause a huge accident or traffic jam.  - The economy is extremely frustrating. There are no small-town service buildings, so to cater for your citizen demands you need to build service buildings priced for cities much larger than what you have. This results in grinding your city's economy into the ground. The only way around this is to largely ignore city services until at least 25k population when your tax revenue is starting to be enough to pay for these demanded services. All the while the annoying bird, building icons, and radio announcements will continue harping on about all these citizen demands. On the flip side, electricity and water exports are priced so out of balance, that building a few extra coal power plants and water pumps, and exporting every single piece of it, will have you swimming in money.  - The whole off map servicing of your citizens is quite simply extremely flawed at it's foundations. When you utilise off map services, the price of those services do not adjust to cater for the simple economic principle of supply and demand. You can pump as much electricity to the off map as you can, and the game will continue to give you the same high price for each MWh. Same with importing off map services. Using off map fire services will remain the extremely cheap price no matter how many fires they have to come and put out.  - The garbage system is totally cactus. Your incinerators will go get garbage from off map to burn, rather than burning your own. Your landfill fills up, your buildings fill up, and stupidly off map garbage trucks come and get your rubbish. The only way to get around this is to build huge landfills, and once they are full just bulldoze it. Poof, all garbage gone. Since incinerators don't collect your garbage from landfills, as it's cheaper for them to drive off map and get it there, it's the only way to process landfill.  TL:DR - Optimisation issues aside, there are MAJOR flaws in each of the game's simulations. The entire game presents a facade, layered on top of fancy marketing speak. I think in reality, this game is the most fake city builder out of any of the top-tier city builders in the 30+ years I've been playing city builders. Ultimately, I do not see how Colossal Order/Paradox proceed from here."

There are zero challenges with the traffic.  Oh, there is finally a DLC, Beach Properties - like extra assets but you don't have beaches in the game.

183690450,english,0,949230,"Well, after almost 100 Hours, guess it's Review time...  First, I bought the Ultimate Edition when the game came out, over a year ago by now...in hindsight I shouldn't have done that. But as we all know, hindsight is 20/20…  The Release was awful, dare I say, one of the worst states a game came out I have every personally seen. This game should have NEVER been released in the form it was. I generally like Paradox, I played a lot of their games, some way too much. Same with Colossal, I have over 500 Hours in Cities Skylines 1, but the way this was released, to be frank, I should have refunded it.  Even though all this was bad, you could say terrible, at least Colossal Order communicated with the community, though to be clear, it doesn't change the fact that this should have never been sold as a full price game, because the initial release was more like an alpha test.  I checked every time there was an update and yes they did their best to update it as fast as possible, fixing bugs, improving performance. After 1 or 2 months or so it was playable, performance wise, but the economy was kind of broken.  After a while I lost interest in the game, without modding, the game was dead for me, a waste of €90.  I checked again when FINALLY modding came, Paradox's own ""Workshop"" came, Paradox Mods for CS2. But finding out that ""for now"" we will only have code mods, so no new Buildings made by the community to enhance the game to where CS1 was at that time, was a bummer. In hopes that that would come soon, I gave it a chance. But soon was not so soon...  I lost Interest again and didn't play the game for half a year. To this day, 25th, December 2024, we still don't have close to what came for CS1 over the years. Now one could say with the region packs there is something and I want to thank all the people involved in those for what they made. But why don't we have building mods the way we had them in CS1?  To be frank, I lost hope for this game, I wish this will become what CS1 became, but my gut feeling is that this game is more or less written off as a loss, never to be finished the way it was meant to be in the devs minds. I wish, and I want to be wrong about that. But my gut tells me otherwise    And that's why, for me, for now, I can't recommend buying this game. After over a Year, it is still in a State that feel horrible and I personally have to say, from now on I will be careful with buying Ultimate Editions of games from Paradox, before CS2 they had that trust, that many others lost already, with this they lost that. What a disappointment.   If any of the developers read this. I am sorry, but you probably know as much, if not better, that this should have never been released the way it was. I personally, as a customer, rather wait longer for a product and get a product that is in good shape, then getting what we got. To compare it with something. This release felt like I just bought a car, without Engine, with the promise that that will be delivered soon, and it was just not in stock. Without a steering Wheel and doors."
177184040,english,1,949230,"If you've never played a Cities game play CS1, then with DLC, then with mods first. Come to this if you're a fan of that and want a graphical update, economy, and gameplay change. However, despite this CS1 will always be better for a long time. That is solely because of the amount of time updates, DLC, and mods have flooded into the community. Each fix of CS2 is a step towards the right direction but it doesn't overshadow the fact that the launch was very disappointing. It should never be standard in the industry.   Performance and stability has improved since launch for me. Pretty playable and the essential mods from CS1 are here. It's also a very pretty game but CS2 is not without its flaws including some occasional crashes. Consistent updates will help but buyers beware. This game is a slow burn towards what it can become.  Overall I would say this is a cautiously positive 6/10"

Id recommend just play SIM city. Im done supporting this trash company.
166501755,english,0,949230,"I have almost 1200 hours in CS1. I bought it the day it came out and played on and off religiously for almost 10 years. Yes, it was nearly the perfect city builder at launch and was only consistently made better by the modding community.  I was absolute overjoyed when I saw the release trailer for CS2, so much so I took a vacation day so I would be able to dedicate the entire day to playing it when it launched.  Leading up to launch day I ignored the early access reviews and kept telling myself its just nonsense. Launch day comes and I was heartbroken. Poorly optimized, no mod support, no map editor, almost no changes that were promised were working, and the game was nearly unplayable due to crashing and freezing. I still held off on giving a poor review.  8 months later I see that mod support and map editing are in beta, and that the game has been optimized better. I re-download the game and hop in and things look promising. Load into a new game and the moment i go to lay my first road the game crashes. Just completely disappears off my screen. Load back in, new map downloaded from the mod store and it loads in completely dark, no UI anywhere and I couldnt even exit the game because the escape key wouldnt open the menu.  Alt+F4 and uninstalled again. I have 1.1 hours in this game and about 45 minutes of that was browsing the mod store. I can't even being to explain how disappointed and saddened i am over this. I have less and less time to dedicate to gaming now that i am approaching my 40s and CS was ALWAYS the game i could hop into and know i could relax and enjoy. It seems i cant even lay a single road almost a year into launch for a game i paid full price for.  Shame on Colossal Order, i am so disappointed."
191009754,english,0,949230,"I've waited a long time to write this maybe because, while I don't have a full understanding how game development works, I do appreciate the time it takes to produce something like this. But I think I'm at the point where I'm done. I pre-purchased the base edition and ""played"" during launch week, if you want to call it that. I completely understood launch issues and even the fact, many weeks afterward, that they were rushed to get this game out. By this point, not much has changed. I have 2 main issues that I just can't get over.  1. I realize this an extreme personal preference but the idea that we cannot get more pre-made intersection and interchange assets, even if by community modders, kills a lot of enjoyment for me. Call it lack of creativity or intelligence, but I'd rather worry about the layout of the city and not trying to find ways to make a kindergarten level highway interchange for myself. Something the first game did wonderfully in my view.   2. This is much more general of a complaint that my first issue kinda ties into. I keep asking myself, ""What have I gained by playing Cities Skylines 2 instead of the first game?"" Some people would have to point this out to me because, with my play-style, I can't think of much. Defiantly not enough to warrant the money, time, and patience I've put into this game.  I have come to the conclusion that I am no longer going to put any more hope into this game. I feel I've waited long enough and with all respect to the devs, I will uninstall this one and just go back to the first one. Maybe even continue to buy DLC's for it. But I refuse to put anymore faith in a game that is, essentially, a worse quality version of it's previous game. I would honestly love a refund for this game. I would maybe even use the refund to put back into DLC's for the first Cities. But fat chance of that by now.   I want to make it clear that I've been on steam for close to 15 years and I've rarely....RARELY left a bad review. Even when a game was absolute garbage. I would just uninstall and chalk it up as a loss. But this is different. I vividly remember when the first Cities came out and it was a godsend. Sim City had gone so far downhill that I commented to my wife, ""This is what the new Sim City should have been!"" Unfortunately, it only took Cities one game cycle for it to fall into the same hole. One could ask, ""What happened?"" Or  worse off, ""What's happening,"" since it hasn't gotten much past the point of, ""At least it runs...kind of.""  Conclusion, and it saddens my heart to say it, but if you're considering buying this game...just don't. Not even on sale. Buy the first one and save yourself the trouble and actually have some fun."
176134262,english,0,949230,"Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game at the moment (3/10). After 200 hours of trying to enjoy it, I’ve been disappointed by the lack of honesty from the developers. This version of the game is, at best, in a beta stage and feels like an insult to the many fans of the first game. Numerous features are missing, and we all know why: they’ll be sold as DLC, just to squeeze more money out of us.  Update January 16: The free addition of Creator Packs brings renewed appeal to the game and enhances diversity in city creation. This is a step in the right direction, but there is still much to be done."
156564590,english,0,949230,"[b]Cities Skylines II[/b] was a very long-awaited sequel to the most famous [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/]Cities Skylines I[/url].  [h1]What went wrong?[/h1]  Turns out - [u]Everything[/u] Let's go over some simpler aspects of why this game failed at launch.  [olist] [*]Having multiple ""Editions"" of the base game. Now, of course, I am not saying that this is a bad thing. If one really wants to support his favorite developer - he can freely do so, by buying a higher ""Edition"" of a game. The problem came with the rewards - [b]At the time of writing this review, people that have ordered said ""Editions"", have NOT yet received their rewards.[/b] Whenever you offer your game for multiple prices, people have a set [u]expectation[/u] that you, as a developer, must match. This was not shown by Colossal Order whatsoever.  [*]The game was announced in the March, and released in [b]October[/b] of the same year. Of course, some game companies tend to work on sequels undercover, and announce them only after they deem it ""up to their standards"". [i]This was not the case for Cities Skylines II.[/i] At launch - it was [b]VERY, and I mean VERY[/b] ""optimised"". I am gaming on 64GB of RAM and a 3070 Alongside a Intel i7-10700k, which is a pretty solid build. Result? Average of about 20-30 FPS on Medium graphic settings on a settlement with about 15k people. To also add salt on to the wound - game would frequently crash. I am talking consistent crashes every 15-20 minutes.  [*]Not being able to receive backlash for a very bad release of the game. If you were like most, and were of course, not satisfied with the release of the game in such a state, you would try to go and say it on the forums, write reviews, and ask developers questions as to how the fuck it is possible to release this junk. What you receive? A mute. Maybe a temporary ban for the time being for ""Harassing"" the developers. Now, I understand we are human, and being human means making mistakes. BUT WHAT THE FUCK?! You release a very, [b]VERY[/b] underbaked game, and then you decide to call everyone who doesn't like this garbage as ""Harassers"" and ""Demoralisers"".  [*]Mods. Or - lack thereof. Recently read a post from OC. It's the 9th OC post, and inside, and I quote -  [quote=Colossal Order Ltd.]Public Beta version of code modding and Paradox Mods will be available in the live build by the end of March. Public Beta version of Map editing available in the live build together with code modding or soon after. Public Beta version of Asset editing to be announced, only after the technical issues are sorted can we roll out the tool.[/quote] ... So, let me get this straight. You release a half-baked game ... With no modding support ... Until a year later ...? And of course, people got mad. Rightfully so.  [*]Problems. Bugs. And many core features missing. Of course, of course! What did you expect?? A Paradox game having a good launch?! Phaha! Don't make me laugh, both of us know that this will persist, until Colossal Order will start making [b]DLC's[/b], which not only paywall the original core features, but also do the damned bug fixes. [/olist]  [h1]Final Review[/h1]  At the state the game is currently - I doubt it is worth your time. You could spend the time you have on something more useful, or a game that is more fun. If you [b]really[/b] enjoy city-builders, and want to do something in them, then you can buy this game.  My review? About [i]3.5 out of 10[/i]. If you want to buy it, wait for a sale.

188885073,english,0,949230,"After eagerly anticipating the sequel to one of my favorite city builders, Cities Skylines 2 has been nothing but a disappointment. I pre-ordered the maximum version, investing significantly in what I hoped would be an amazing follow-up, but my excitement quickly turned to frustration.  The gameplay and economy have been simplified to the point of being uninteresting. Where the original game offered depth and strategic challenge, the sequel presents shallow mechanics that fail to engage long-term players. Most frustrating is that the DLC strategy focuses entirely on cosmetic additions rather than expanding gameplay with meaningful functional elements.   Also game not received the Ukrainian language support, which feels like an oversight given the global nature of the player base.  Technical issues have plagued the game since launch, with numerous bugs remaining unfixed for over a year. The developers seem more interested in pushing out visual DLC than addressing these fundamental problems.  The final straw came when the game crashed during a save operation. Upon restarting, I discovered all my save files were corrupted and completely unrecoverable - dozens of hours of careful city planning and building completely erased in an instant. This level of instability is simply unacceptable for a full-priced game with paid DLC.  I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2 in its current state, especially to fans of the original. Wait for significant patches or deep discounts before considering this disappointing sequel."
178222959,english,0,949230,"Cities: Skylines II is a promising game that has made significant improvements since its launch. However, it still falls short of its predecessor and the lofty expectations set by its developers.  The recent security breach, where malicious code was uploaded through the mod system, is a major setback. This incident highlights a serious lack of oversight and raises concerns about the developers' competence.  Given these issues, I have decided to uninstall the game. It's unfortunate to see such a potentially great game tarnished by poor development choices and security lapses."
163583527,english,0,949230,"I loved CS 1. For those of us who are not artistically inclined it provided a perfect sandbox to design & create. Truly, if you could imagine it, you could create it. I have (almost) as much fun ""shopping"" for mods as running the simulation (yes, unlike CS 2, CS 1 tries to be a simulation). It was the most unique and satisfying computer game (with the possible exception of KSP) I ever experienced.  But it is time to face facts: CS 2 will NEVER be superior to CS 1. Why?  First, it is not a true attempt at a simulation. The idea that if you cant supply your denizens that magic, invisible Amazon trucks will simple deliver what is needed is just an example. I'm sure there are other examples, but I have better things to do than pick apart the obviously rushed and half-baked work the designers did. What's the challenge of making a city both functional and beautiful if the simulation doesn't care?  Second, this is an UGLY game. The muted colors, building designs, etc. are drab. The resource buildings (how farms and mines are laid) are downright hideous. No corn, wheat or barley fields laid out in a nice checkerboard like (with mods) you get in CS 1, but blobby patches with haphazard buildings strewn all over the place. Did these guys even bother to look at pictures of farms in Europe or the US?  Third: Modding. It should have been a red alarm bell when modding was closed off behind the companies own platform. There really is only one reason for it. They are going to monetize the shit out of this product, and any modders (who are truly the simulation's heroes: King Leno et. al., you are tops!) are going to be frozen out. ""Oh, you have created 12 different palm trees? Well forget it. We are going to give them 4....and make 'em pay."" This will not change. They well make sure that ANY asset mod better than what they want to push down your gullet never sees the light of day. You stick with this simulation, hold on to your wallet, it's going to be a bumpy ride.  The thing is, it all could have been so different. They could have easily put this thing together by bringing in the modders, paying for the IP they put in to the first game, intergrate it with better graphics and UI, leave it open on Steam to mod, and save all those content creators on You Tube who were either left twisting in the wind or shown to be shills for an inferior product.  Instead they chose the AAA studio path. Put out an unfinished mess to save Q3 earnings. Make it as bland and broadly appealing as possible to get the fish hook in as many mouths as they could, and monetize the shit out of it. The word tragedy comes to mind.  I don't write reviews often, and never negative ones. I'm not as CS hater. If you look at my review for CS 1 I practically gush.  But when you take a vibrant, engaging simulation, and a equally vibrant and engaging community supporting it, and destroy them, I have to call it out for what it is: An example of sloth, crassness, and greed.  There is an answer. They mat have played me for a sucker in buying the base game, but they will NEVER get a dime more from me. They will NEVER get me to trust Paradox enough to pre-order on of their products, thinking they they are some not like Bethesda, Ubi Soft, or any other AAA a-holes who would shame a con man. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.  If you want to change this behavior, just do the same. Just say NO. You deserve no empathy if you put your hand on the stovetop a second time and get burned."
174971013,english,1,949230,"Colossal Order please re watch your own promotion video from 5 years ago by Justin Roczniak/donoteat01 and listen to what he says. That's what a good city simulation needs to be able to do, on top of being a good looking city painter.     Its a start but still has some odd design. I think the worst part is somehow its more sterile and overly clean felling than the first game. Shame on Paradox for pushing this out the door long before it was ready. Making hardware requirements this high end was a fundamental misread of your audience. City builders are traditionally played on mid range systems and laptops and by people who often don't prioritize cutting edge first person shooter/ action game graphics."
158795794,english,0,949230,"The CEO is a joke. Constantly blaming the player base for beeing ""toxic"". You are scammers not more not less. You over and false advertised your game and delivered a not working piece of junk. And still you dont get why people are upset. ""We worked so hard...""- Yes and still you managed to deliver shit. Congrats.  Normaly i wouldnt write any comment on that and just carry on, but the rly annoying behavior of the CEO, since release, trying to set themselfs as victims here is unaccaptable. I loved CS1 but CS2 is nothing more than a scam...sadly."
186093265,english,0,949230,"So many issues. You better have a huge C:\ drive because this game, no matter where you install it, sends all mod folders and downloaded content there. And you can't change it. They decided to have their own workshop platform, despite the fact that Steam workshop was perfectly adequate - and so far, they've distributed actual malware to their players, held up mods for almost a year straight, the game has to refresh 4 times in the main menu and you have to restart it several times.  I'm currently in a dilemma where I can't even access the game at all, even when launching with mods disabled. Round of applause for Paradox and CO please. These complaints don't even scratch the surface, have a glance at other reviews to appreciate the scale of ineptitude. Maybe buy this in 5 years? When they've figured out the basics. Because at the moment, it is a horrible headache of a game."
149251690,english,0,949230,"Setting aside graphics performance at launch, which is terrible, Cities Skylines 2 is a deeply broken city simulation game.  To be more precise, it doesn't actually simulate a city in any meaningful way and it's barely a game.  The economy and various systems are all FAKE; smoke and mirrors to give you an illusion of control and choice. Don't build a garbage dump? Garbage will be automatically trucked out of your city on its own by magic. Fail to have commercial or industry? The city *just works*.  The ""much improved"" traffic AI they claimed would eliminate the first game's traffic problems? It just makes cars teleport to their destination if they're being too slow.  These are a just a few examples, but every single thing they claim is being simulated, isn't. It's all incredibly shallow and fake and falls apart with more than a surface inspection. In terms if city management, simulation and city designing, It is several steps backwards from the first Cities Skylines in every way.  It is completely unsatisfying to play."
150319952,english,0,949230,"""Thanks for the chats all, but I'm moving on. :) EDIT: (Nov 17) I've heard from Paradox support to the query I logged. They confirm I was banned for this post, where I said ""Publishing games as bare bones as possible (even removing content to plunder later, looking at you pre-release DLC that CS2 has), is customer abuse IMO."".  The Paradox support person went on to state: ""Frankly I would have issued a much sterner infraction than the minor ""trollish comments"" one you got for that!"" (I can provide a screenshot of the email to those interested).  My comment got me a one month ban. Proves my point. ------------------------------------------------------ ORIGINAL POST STARTS HERE: I love city building games. I mean the ones where you can build up massive modern metropolis's like in this game. I remember getting my hands on SimCity back in the old days, and instantly fell in love with it. I would lay down roads, zones, services for the city, and watch it grow at my hands. And I loved every single city builder that came along. The various SimCity versions (except 2013), Cities XL/XXL/all the versions, City Skylines, and Highrise City. SimCity 4 is definitely my most favourite of the city builders.  When I heard that Cities Skylines 2 was being made, I got pretty excited. But also, pretty worried. I was really excited, because a new game in my second favourite type of game was coming out. And the videos made it look really good! But I was worried. Worried because Paradox was publishing it.  When CS1 came out, it was an insta-buy for me. I really enjoyed the game. I was happily playing along, making cities, and then the DLC start coming out. Before CS1 came out, for years I had bought Paradox games and the DLC. However, I was really getting annoyed by the DLC policy of Paradox. CS1 came out on the heels of the 80th or something DLC for Crusader Kings 2. Not to mention the countless DLC for HOI and EU that I also played. So when the DLC starting coming out thick for CS1, I decided it was time to bow out of Paradox and put them on ""the list"". ""The list"" contains the publishers I will not buy games from. There's a few now, including EA for what they did to SimCity/Maxis. Paradox had joined them. I did not buy a single item from Paradox after June 2017. I wanted to, believe me. But this was my very minor protest against their DLC policy.  And then came Cities Skylines 2. I actually held my ground, until the day before release. I knew if I bought in, I'd be buying into the DLC flood. I was really conflicted. I knew Paradox was going to DLC the hell out of the game, and there was the performance announcement before hand but I knew from experience (with my work) that performance can (and usually does) get fixed. But I REALLY wanted to play a city builder. So I caved, and bought the standard edition. Hey, at least I would minimise my losses to $70 (AUD).  The day came, and I downloaded it, and started to play. After changing a few graphics settings, I was okay with sitting on medium graphics and tuning a few things like RPS suggested to. And I played.  But it wasn't too long before I started noticing things. But I kept playing. I noticed even more things, and read about similar things others were noticing on the Paradox forum and here. I got to 25 hours and wrote my review. I didn't want to give a cheap 2 hours review, so I gave the game an honest shot. I was actually really shocked how popular my review became. I just wrote what I honestly saw in the game.  Then the hostility began. I found myself banned for 3 days at Paradox forums for the most flimsy of reasons (the review was being discussed there and I commented on that thread). At around the same time, I started getting threats and hostile posts on my steam profile, my workshop items for other games, and ended up playing whack-a-mole deletion of posts. No point reporting as they were level 0 empty profiles just made to attack me. But I did keep playing, because maybe they had a point. Maybe I'd misunderstood some things.  Anyways, eventually I hit 85 hours. I was done. I did an update to my review, and my 3 points that I feel kill the game for me stand. They are: 1. Performance and bugs. Whilst performance had improved on the graphics side, over 250k pop my PC would start suffering from repeated stuttering. This was simulation, not graphical. The list of bugs is massive. Just look at the confirmed list on Paradox forums. 2. Lack of content. The extreme lack of content is really disappointing. Obvious hat tip to DLCing us to hell. Yeah, there's a content creator pack of some couple thousand assets coming for free, but I would put a hundy on it that the original point of that pack was to introduce paid-for curated special content on Paradox mods. But they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants and giving it for free now. 3. Design choices. There are lots of design choices that just simply don't make sense.  It was at this time that I posted a new thread on Paradox forums outlining the above, and that I was putting the game down for now. Shortly after that thread was posted, I found myself banned for a full month. I have read carefully the code of conduct, the infraction matrix, and also the support page on forum user rules. I cannot see anything I could have legitimately been banned for. I can only think it was because I have been vocal in honest criticism (it's not the only time Paradox has been caught censoring their forums of negative feedback). Their code of conduct and support page also give you some instructions when banned. Contact the moderator in the instance, or if you cannot contact that moderator, email admin@paradoxinteractive. The irony is, when you are banned, you cannot access the messaging system to read the notice why you got banned. Nor can you reply to it. So I've tried emailing (politely) the email address a couple of times. I've had no reply. I don't believe I will get a response either.  So at this point, I am done. I feel that my feedback is not wanted, nor do they want to hear it. I believe that Paradox doesn't want me around, and I will just continuously be banned at Paradox forums, and if I continue to post here, banned here as well. I actually don't think this post will last long, but hey, let's give it a try. I'll screenshot it and post it to my steam profile. Avanya can't get to me there. Hahaha.  I will never, ever, buy another Paradox product. My experience with Paradox in the past, and especially recently, is that they are a hostile, abusive company that will stop at nothing to suppress honest critical feedback that they believe may impact their shareholder profits. My belief that Paradox is an extremely toxic company has been reinforced with my recent interactions with this company. I will never engage with Paradox forums again. I will never engage with any of their product, or the products of any company that has an association with Paradox. I am completely done with this company.  To everyone I've chatted with here, go in peace and have some fun. Thank you, all of you, for the fun times I had here. Even you Stealthy, even though I still think you're a Paradox employee here to muffle out any negative comments. You never did answer my question, but it's okay, you're off the hook now.   My review: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998739866/recommended/949230 Paradox thread I got one month ban for: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/its-time-to-put-cs2-down.1608679/""  This is the state of CO and paradox as a entirety, this one persons feelings has everything I have to feel about Paradox. They have gotten to the point that they just ban criticism because its ""mean"" This game along with CK3 and Vicky3 clearly show that we are little more than cattle for PDX to harvest for money. Friends its time to retire from playing PDX games. Its been a good ride but all things must come to an end."
177621498,english,1,949230,"This game still lacks a lot of of basic things and feels unfinished. But I have to admit, I haven't played CS1 since I got this game. Overall, I like it."
185833970,english,0,949230,"I have never been so conflicted.  I have re-downloaded CS2 about 5 times now, compelled by the overwhelming amount of beautiful showcases of CS2 cities on r/CitiesSkylines. Every time I have re-download CS2, I am immediately reminded why I uninstalled it. I want to like this game, I love the realism of the graphics, the animations of the sims, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and of course the option to make an intersection into a round-a-bout.  Unfortunately despite all of these new features CS2 compares nothing to CS1, I must admit, I do play with all the CS1 add-ons and was extremely disappointed when I first played CS2 to see I could no longer make my own custom university, airport, or park. Even despite all the additional content of CS1, it still prevails as the better game. If not for it's lack of bugs and glitches, then be for the lack of malware issues.  Never before have I wanted, nor even considered writing a review about a game, not even my favourite games, not even the masterpiece that is CS1, but the existence of CS2 conflicts me. I want to like the game, I want to play the game, I want to enjoy the game, but yet I don't. As the sequel to CS1, CS2 looks amazing, and it's features and game play pull me away from CS1, but its bugs, glitches, and, lack of customisation push me into a weird spot where I can't bring myself to play either game, a feeling so weird, it compelled me to write my first and probably only review."
149758101,english,1,949230,"I'm gonna try to be genuinely honest here. The situation for the game is pretty nuanced, and that can be difficult to express in a time when everything needs to be a meme and/or the worst/best thing to ever happen. In short: you can buy the game right now and have a heck of a lot of fun, but the game might have gotten off to a better initial reception had it been delayed for another 6 months or so.  Pros: The game is a lot of fun at this stage, and I am so happy we already get to play it whenever we want.  1. What is here now is definitely enough to call this a ""full release.""  2. You can do a LOT, and you have much better tools out the gate compared to the first game. It's less finicky, while also more powerful, so it's a heck of a lot easier to reach a higher baseline of cool-looking cities. Can't overstate how much of an evolution this is. Examples: road tool is insane, zoning (and the way assets are categorized) gives you much more control, as well as more types of zoning.  3. Performance issues aside, the game is an insane visual upgrade. The game can look frankly shockingly impressive. This ties into the first point to make cities better-looking by default. In the first, you'd need several mods to start making cool cities. Not here.   4. The simulation is really hecking cool. There are some bugs, but in general the way the city works with individually simulated agents makes for a city that has sort of its own life independent of your decisions - all of a sudden, you might notice a lot of people have educated themselves and consequently want different places to work and live so you now have a bunch of other options to build different stuff. Cool! So, it needs a little bit of work, but it's absolutely mostly there.  5. Since everything is simulated, traffic is a lot better. Mostly, you're fine, and at rush hour you get some backup. That's pretty much it now.   Cons: there are pretty good arguments it could have been a) delayed for like 6 months or b) released as an Early Access product.  1. Quite a lot of small bugs. Whether it's education being unbalanced, commercial having weird import/export stuff, or garbage being handled oddly, there's stuff in the simulation that isn't working as intended, or is in need of further balancing. Most of the stuff is simply down to not having played the game enough before to notice, or not having enough time to fix it. I guess it's annoying if you sit and think about it, but not a single one of the bugs have really bothered me in a meaningful way.  2. Performance is bad, but Colossal Order have been very upfront about that from before the game was released. Some of the reporting on it post-release, however, makes it seem like they just didn't have enough time to finish all the work. For instance, the reports on wild amounts of polygons being rendered, the acknowledge (more-or-less) by Colossal Order about LOD work simply not being finished, or the broken effects (you pretty much need to turn some of them off.) You can ABSOLUTELY run the game - just check out the posted performance guides on which effects to turn off.   3. Compared to a very kitted up Cities Skylines 1, with all DLC and mods, you might feel a little restricted. If you've played it a lot you'll come across situations where you go ""what a great spot this would be for a custom park,"" or whatever feature from the first game's 10-year life cycle. If you've never played that version of the first game, you might come across situations where you're like ""so I just build more of mostly the same type of district?"" And...both yes and no. There is some challenge to be creative, but on the other hand that forces you to familiarize yourself with the tools at hand to get the most creativity out of what IS here. Your mileage may vary.  4. Bluntly, some things just make it seem like the game is like 3/4 finished. Why are there no unlocks past the half-way point of the development roadmap (small city-big city etc)? Room for future expansions, or planned but cut features? Who knows. Don't get me wrong, these are non-essential things, but the feeling is there after almost 70 hours in the game.  Taken as it is, you could argue they should've delayed 6 months or released into Early Access instead. But you can also argue that releasing it will ultimately make the game much better much faster by both a) making the developers accountable to the players rather than some arbitrary release date and b) giving them more feedback than they could ever need to improve the game. Is it a little cynical? Maybe. Did they coldly calculate that the short-term reputation loss would be offset by the longer-term improvements of both what the bottom line looks like for the fiscal quarter as well as the game itself? Also maybe, but don't they have a right to do that, and do we need to be maximally dramatic about it if that is what they decide to do? Looking at it coolly, it is a complicated situation for a company, and either way they would have gone there would have been pros and cons. I won't presume I'd know so perfectly well what would be the right thing to do for players, employees, publisher, and the company itself.  Furthermore, you could argue that the Early Access label brings with it certain connotations - a never-ending cycle of waiting for when the game is no longer ""almost finished"" and developers who just abuse the concept to avoid accountability or expectations of quality. Also, is it maybe not allowed to release something as Early Access, when it's already been marketed as a ""full release"" sort of thing? Heck if I know - I'm not a lawyer!  To sum it up: Issues notwithstanding, I'm super glad I'm playing the game now rather than in 6 months. I'm glad I get to play it in a state where I can expect what is there to be enough for a release, and don't have to think about what's a month or two down the line. As for the rest of it, I might feel a way about it, but ultimately I'll leave up to Colossal Order because it's their product in the end."
170579341,english,0,949230,"Ok, cards on the table, I was really excited to see the new release after so many years. But to our dismay, you have somehow ruined it in ways we did not expect.   Pros:  1. better graphics 2. cooler looking city services buildings  Cons: 1. Graphics have STEEP performance requirements.  2. A lot of terrain tools were removed.  3. even on a rig equiped with a ryzen 9 with the 3090 and over 64 gigs of ram, i lag down to 10 fps. 4. population 10,000 lag starts opposed to the 30,000 population that the old game allowed before lag started. 5. Chirper is replaced by radio that wont shut up. even when paused, i hear it. Dear devs, old chirper was annoying enough, but it astonishes me how you've found ways to make it worse. 6. Infrastructure buildings became MASSIVE. so massive in fact, that instead of adding public transport as a feature to your city, your city is a feature of your transit buildings.  7. you can no longer tell where a majority of your path-finding is going on. in the old game, i could tell where a lot of vehicles were trying to go, so i could optimize. here, its all guesswork. not fun. 8. no access to the steam workshop, however you did add your own store so that people who had their mods here, lost their traffic.  9. money. no matter what i do in this game, after SO long with the first one, i cannot for the life of me stay in the green. No amount of tutorials, even COPYING youtuber's ""successful"" cities. i always find myself needing to take out loans.  10. lack of road options. I want a 6 lane avenue with bike lanes and tram lanes for starters.  11. Bugs. i understand that games have bugs on early access, and really early years, but this is some Bethesda level stuff here.  12. you tried so hard to make a continuation of your game to make money, but you are driving away people because you provoke us to write reviews like THIS!   Fellow steam user, please give this game at least another year if not two before you buy."
177252074,english,0,949230,"As a huge fan of the first Cities: Skylines, which—despite becoming a classic Paradox DLC cash grab—still worked and worked well across the board, I had high hopes for the much-anticipated sequel. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Cities: Skylines 2.  The game is plagued by endless bugs that seem to multiply with every patch. Every ""fix"" only introduces more issues, leaving the game barely functional. The so-called ""Economy 2.0"" update? A joke. All it does is give you slightly less starting money, nothing more. The game has been out for almost a year, and we're still missing basic features like hotels. And when you ask about it on the forums, the developers respond with cheery emoticons, telling you to turn on developer mode and manually install them yourself.  Are you kidding me? You can't fix something this simple? Do you even realize that the only reason people didn’t refund your game in the first 20 minutes is because they trusted you? And what did you do? You slapped us in the face. Honestly, I feel like a clown for sticking with this mess for 184 hours, hoping you'd finally get your act together.  Screw you, Paradox. You've earned it."
186493996,english,0,949230,"Dear Paradox Interactive,  I am deeply disappointed. Why does your game crash so frequently that it’s practically unplayable? Given your reputation and resources, it’s baffling that such issues persist. I expected better. This frustration makes me question whether game development is the right industry for you. Perhaps a career in something like insurance—less reliant on delivering a functional product—might be more fitting. At least then, people like me could avoid this level of disappointment. Please take this as feedback to improve, not just for this game but for future projects. Gamers deserve better.  Fuck you.  Sincerely, A truly dissatisfied customer"
148798733,english,0,949230,"Optimization is so bad that even in the main menu, you could tell that the game is harder than Elden Ring because of the boss called Frames."
148794737,english,0,949230,"Everyone already knows the performance is terrible, so I'll just share my experience so you have a further example to compare to. I have a 13900k, 64gb of ram, and a RTX 4090, playing on a 1440p ultrawide monitor. I got 35 fps at the main menu and in game on a brand new map w/o building a single thing. Turning off motion blur and depth field increased this from 35 to 50 fps.  Not a single other graphics setting changed the performance at all. I turned off every single setting I could or set it to the lowest possible, and still only got 50 fps.  This is impressively bad optimization, I actually can't recall another game recently where changing the graphics settings literally did nothing to fps.  Just stay away from this until they fix it."
188024915,english,0,949230,"I hate the way that it lags, the way that it stutters, I hate the way that it plays  I hate the game, I always need to actually push myself just to start the game and then closed it after the pop up launcher showed up.  I was excited to jump into Cities: Skylines II after hours playing cities skyline 1 on steam and my PS4, expecting an improved city-building experience, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and better option at building road (overall yes, more mechanism than CS 1)  what I got was a game that runs like a broken-down Porsche Mauser tank.  Let’s address the elephant in the room: Cities: Skylines II is horribly optimized. The fact that they list an RTX 3080 as the recommended GPU is ridiculous, frame rates are inconsistent, stuttering is constant, and performance tanks as your city grows. It’s frustrating when a game that should be about creativity and smooth management ends up feeling like an endurance test for your PC/laptop.  I was never asking for ultra-realistic, almost dull graphics. The original Cities: Skylines had a clean, semi-stylized look that made cities feel vibrant and inviting. Cities: Skylines II, on the other hand, leans too hard into realism, making everything look too muted and uninspiring. The lighting feels off, textures look muddy despite the “improvements,” and overall, it lacks the charm of the first game.  hard to enjoy when it runs so poorly, I really like CS1 the way the semi-stylized look....even though the animations were simpler, they had a certain charm that made the city feel alive. I like to see a dog turns into a car, I like to see thousand of people summoning their own car or bike after leaving stadium with angry after their team losing. It kills the immersion rather than enhancing it.   I find myself wanting to go back to Cities: Skylines 1, that's still something that CS 2 can't replicate even after 1 year, 3 months, and 23 days after release."
191111864,english,0,949230,"I was being patient with this game, after the very rocky start, things were starting to slowly look up, but this latest patch has made this game unplayable.

177659738,english,1,949230,Just finished playing 99 hours and I love this game. This is my FIRST computer game (I'm old) and I'm truly enjoying my time in Cities Skylines II and looking forward to what will be offered next.
177341588,english,0,949230,"It's a shame this game was released in such a broken state. Things have gotten better, but it's still a performance nightmare with a not enough content. I put over a hundred hours in it, and I regret that. The bones of the base game are better than CS1, but it just needs more time in the oven and more features in the base game.  I also really resent that Paradox saw fit to release it when they did. It's emblematic of a company that doesn't respect its customers and willfully ignores what its devs are likely telling management."
172636255,english,0,949230,"I bought this game shortly after launch. Despite its initial flaws, I held out hope that the devs would provide patch updates that fixed the issues with game play. Now, despite months since launch and several patches released, the game remains virtually unplayable. Patches meant to fix the game bring about other, larger issues somehow, and it remains painfully obvious that the developers had no business releasing this game when they did. Cities: Skylines 1 became popular in no small part due to the flawed release of another city simulator, and they apparently learned nothing from that situation. I cannot recommend this game."

150199704,english,1,949230,"A potentially great game which is hampered by issues with simulation, glitches, and lack of key features that should have been available from day 1. I still recommend the game, as there is no mixed/middle ground option, as long as one is aware of the game's shortcomings.  GAMEPLAY: Most features from base CS1 are back, together with a mixture of the old DLC content, and even mods, and some new great features of its own. There is a ton of content available, and this is where the game shines.  Building things is much more pleasant in this game than in CS1. No forced roadside requirement. Roads and tracks can intersect multiple other roads/tracks. Upgrading and adjusting roads is much easier. Electricity and water are automatically transported via roads. Adjusting intersections a la TM:PE is a breeze. Roads and tracks can be freely connected to city neighbors. Out of bounds intercity lines are now at the player's discretion.  Buildings can be upgraded via modules, a nice addition and one that quite likely allow for quite a bit of customization later on when mods are allowed - i.e. expandable train stations. Building scale is overall improved relative to the first game, though airports are still horribly undersized.  Maps are bigger, though like in CS1 only a fraction of it is available to the player without mods, and even then there are limits on the number of tiles you can buy. This is a drawback in my opinion, and at the very least the available area that can be bought should be fully available, if not the rest of the map.  SIMULATION: A mixed bag for me. In one hand, traffic is more random and when it works is more pleasant to watch in my opinion. There are nice new touches like seasons - though more control over them is desired - and traffic accidents.   In the other hand, the simulation is very slow, and things take long to progress, even at the fastest simulation speeds. Furthermore, AI vehicles leave a lot to be desired in many circumstances, for example, near highway ramps where they tend to all try to merge into the highway instead of exiting, at the very last second, causing huge backups along the way.  Another key issue for is the separation of residential demand into low/medium/high density. As a sandbox game, the choice of density should be left at player's discretion, especially when commercial and office buildings are not affected by this. In the current state that the game is, there is way too much low residential demand that never seems to end, forcing one to build swaths of suburbia, even if some or all can be replaced at later stages in the game.  GRAPHICS: I quite like the direction of where the game is visually going. However, the execution is poor in that visuals are quite ""grainy"" and pixelated, and can look downright horrible at certain angles and distances, even on the highest graphical settings with a good GPU.  SOUND: The radio with a mix of generic relaxing music intersped with newcasts and talkshows discussing minutiae in and of your city is back. Music is ok but bland, and overall rather limited in which it becomes repetitive pretty quickly. Personally I listen to something else in the background instead.  OTHER ISSUES: At the moment there is no official modding support, or a map editor included, and there is not a big variety of maps to begin with in the base game - only a dozen or so. There are already mods being developed and released in third-party platforms, however.  Furthermore, even when modding support does come in 2024, it will be limited to the Paradox servers, and there will be no Steam Workshop support.  Also, the game may suffer from occasional to frequent crashes to the desktop, so make sure to enable autosave, which comes disabled by default and is a source of grief to many people in the forums. Or at least save manually often.  SUMMARY: Cities Skylines 2 is a game that has a lot of potential but suffers from a rushed release. Updates will likely rectify many of the issues and the review will be re-edited accordingly. In the state that the game is now, and its price, I think is a decent game, and one that is quite entertaining if it runs right, but nowhere near its potential. 6/10  Dec 1st 2023 edit: reduced my rating from 7 to 6, due to finding out no official Steam Workshop, too frequent crashes at times, and quickly dwindling performance in very large cities."

186291447,english,0,949230,"It runs better now than at launch but it still runs very poorly. I want to love this game, I have played over 200 hours but I would advise against purchasing it, the games performance, crashes, bugs, lag are still very frustrating even after a year of promised improvements. While the game runs better than it did at launch it has gone from unplayable to painful to play. The development focus appears to have switched from trying to fix the base game and to endless $$$ DLC."
170585435,english,0,949230,I don't care about the performance of the game unlike the majority of the negative comments. My complaints are entirely gameplay related.  1. Can't build rail bridges over ship routes in rivers/lakes. The developers had almost a year to fix this. 2. Game randomly crashes. No mods installed. 3. Simulation isn't what it used to be in Cities Skylines 1. 4. No steam workshop. Why not? 5. Tons of features in CS 1 that were cut out of CS 2. Too many to name.

192329091,english,0,949230,"As someone who loved the original Cities: Skylines, I came into Cities: Skylines 2 with high hopes. The first game had tons of content, and the Steam Workshop support made it even better. Unfortunately, this isn’t a review of the first game — and that’s where my disappointment starts.  Cities: Skylines 2 improves on a lot of systems from the original. There are some great quality-of-life changes that make city-building smoother and more modern. But even with those improvements, the overall experience feels lacking.  I pre-ordered the game and received 15 DLCs (I believe) as part of the bonus, but most of them are just building reskins or region-specific buildings that don’t add any real gameplay. It’s hard not to compare that to the DLCs for the first game, or the workshop where I could find similar — or better — content for free. What’s worse, the two DLCs I did buy for the first game (which added meaningful content) are completely missing in the sequel.  It’s hard not to feel like Cities: Skylines 2 was rushed out and monetized aggressively. Despite being out for a while, it still lacks the depth and charm of its predecessor. On top of that, I experience random frame drops and lag, even though my PC should be more than capable of handling the game.  Right now, I can’t recommend Cities: Skylines 2. If you’re deciding between the two, the first game still offers a better experience overall — even today. That said, I’ll be checking back periodically to see how it evolves. If things improve significantly, I’ll happily update this review."
186238355,english,0,949230,I have a love hate for this game. I love the mixed zones and all the great features we had to use mods to get in the first game.   However this game crashes all the time. And someone at the company operates with half a brain cell and thought we should leave auto saves toggled off by default. On a game that crashes. The constant crashes and that one setting alone makes me not want to play anymore.  I'll come back in a year or two when they've got their act together.

I am tired of waiting for this game to be playable. It Isn't. DLC's i have payed for are being delayed and delayed and i am tired of supporting such an Incompetent studio. I don't recommend this game, because, ultimately, not once during my significant playtime had i ever thought that this borderline unfinished game has justified its pricetag.

150958533,english,1,949230,"If you like city sim games, then this is an obvious choice. However, seeing as this is a paradox game I would suggest waiting a few patches, or possibly for a sale. You are going to be spending 100-150euro over the years on DLC anyway."

149026228,english,0,949230,"Updated on Aug 29: The game is still in a bad shape, almost all the problems are still present, while the last patch was almost 2 months ago. There's still not much on the Paradox workshop due to the ban on external resources. Very sad.  Update on Apr 12: They could've just used the Steam workshop... Reinventing the wheel hardly end up well.  Update on March 11: It's been 5 months since the release and the mod support is still ""in the works"". I cannot emphasize enough how badly CO played their cards and all that expectation, hype, momentum, whatever has definitely died down. GJ CO and maybe I should check back in a year from now??  Update on Nov 1: - Radio is kinda boring and there's limited track list. Even worse the hosts give you straight up false info (power outage, no more water, etc). - Same thing with the Chirpy - Again, traffic AI is dumb! Sometimes they straight up ignore your signage, sometimes they just do the weirdest thing on the road blocking the entire street. Case in point: [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17l6sfu/radio_traffic_sucks_today_meanwhile_cims_hold_my/]see this[/url]   Update on Oct 29:  I have a 6950XT and 12900K, my profile has not updated to reflect this. Sorry if that confused you!  - If you are like me who hated the new white reflection/torn effect on the roads, do the following -- enable developer mode by adding ""--developerMode"" to your launch options -- load up a game and press Tab -- on GameRending > Shaders, disable BH/Decals/CurvedDecalDeterioration (credit to REV0 for this)  - The performance problem seems to be subsided after experimenting with the graphics settings. I have now ~40fps now, but it's only a 20k pop town so will see how things scales. Random stuttering still occurs.  - Traffic AI is actually kinda bad and borderline funny. Erratic lane merging, getting stuck on a roundabout, or 5-point U-turn on a street was often observed.  - I studied some issues in the game economy and the solutions are... uh.... quite not what I expected. For example for the ""Not Enough Customers"" issue, it was advised to tear down its neighboring business(es) until you roll into a biz that happened to use what that shop is selling. For example you can have a Food company with not enough customers, and you should keep demolishing its neighbors till you get a Restaurant company that turns Food into Meal. Problem solved. Or is it???  - Likewise ""Rent Too High"" issue is because my citizens are lacking education etc. to find a job to afford the rent. Despite I have a number of schools all the way from elementary to college. I built buses to facilitate transit. Nope still not enough people literally are broke they can't even afford ""Low Rent Housing"". Guess the game is telling me I need UBI in the city?  And before you asked, yes the game does feel like an upgrade from the first iteration with many much needed changes and QoL improvements. However I do have high expectations from the CO and I hope these issues are rectified before I can wholeheartedly recommend the game.  Do I like the game? Yes but only because I loved CSL 1. Do I recommend it at this stage to anyone? No.   ================================= I really, really, really wanted to like it - but the game could use much needed improvements right now.   Issues includes the following: 1. Performance. The latest 1.0.11 patch did enable ~80fps in the main menu, but in game it's still around 20-30fps. Worse still the game now is stuttering very bad when I pan the camera, which didn't happen with the original release. This made the game literally unplayable for me post update.  2. Tutorial could be made better and more accessible. As of now it doesn't cover basics well enough, and as a CSL1 player I got confused with some aspects still.   3. Rent too high? Not enough customers? Buildings getting abandoned? I have no clue how to solve them and the game isn't exactly telling me how to solve them either.  4. Bugs especially how terrain and buildings/roads interact can be funny.  5. Not mod ready still :((  I will come back and revise this review should anything improves."
150075326,english,0,949230,"- Horrible performance - No variety in terms of assets (mostly buildings) - No mod support - Progression seems odd - Balance issues (economy broken; education broken; import & export broken) - Lots of graphic bugs (clipping, flickering) - Traffic Ai stupid - Zoning System also stupid AF - Can't turn off Winter.

Subways have thousands of citizens, but only a few actually board the trains. Only 30 passengers use trains, and half of the cargo trains transport 0% of the cargo load from nearby cities. Tourism is completely broken—no visible tourists, zero hotels, and so on. It's fun to start the game, but once you reach a population of around 100,000, the bugs drain the joy from what could have been an amazing game."

CS2 still has some distance to gain in those respects, but definitely don't rule it out. As the devs start matching the features from CS1 as well as building new features and in-game abilities, CS2 will be quite the superior city builder. I can understand the mixed player feedback right now, but watch this space."

168892554,english,1,949230,"Cities Skylines 2 has had a bit of a rocky start, and I believe it's due in part because of Paradox probably pushing to get CS2 out earlier than it ought to have, and CO being the victim of its success with CS1 that it's set expectation way into the stratosphere.  That being said, with the release of the Economy 2.0 and the now additional assets just released, I would say if you've been on the fence about getting CS2, then I think now is a good time to get into it.  CO have been working hard on getting optimising the performance. They have listened to the community and have retracted the beach property DLC and incorparated them into the main vanilla game instead. They have reworked the economy which is a welcome change and actually makes the game a challenge and fun to play. The newly released assets are fantastic additions that now allow me to build smaller communities, and cul-de-sacs!!  The game still has more promise. When CO release a working version of an asset editor, this game will explode with potential. There's already some fantastic modders and content creators who are able to make truly stunning cities.  If you're happy to mod your game, and are into high level detail, then I advise you check out Sully's youtube video on detailing Snowdonia. It is utterly breathtaking. This is what I wanted from CS2 and Im glad we have it.  I'm not one of these people who set unrealisticly high expectations. I knew full well that any base version of  second game will be a rough diamond. Much like CS1 was when it released. CS1.  Very much enjoy this game."

So... while I've been perfectly happy with CS:II up to this point, I am now contributing my negative review.  At this point the game doesn't even run reliably anymore. I start it. It crashes. With or without mods. So fucking dumb. The whole point of this sequel was to integrate some of the improvements CS1 saw in the user mods so that we had a more stable game base to play with.   That's not the case at all here. This is just a rebranding. It's barebones play that still relies on user mods to make it a functional game. Most of my recent time 'in game', is spent troubleshooting. At least the last 20 hours."
175366797,english,0,949230,"It was one of the few games I was really looking forward to and bought it day one. It was disapointing launch and I didn´t play it for awhile. but somehow playing it now after multiple patches and fixes it feels even worse then launch. Expenses seem unreasonably high, graphics look cartoonish and washed (streets and houses look flat and bland), industry makes no sense and there is a feeling that there is no life in the city, just random cars and people. There is a high demand for high residencial, but no demand for shops or factories? Makes no sense. You need to have car access to park? Why? Garbage piles up so fast in 10k population city. No bike roads, electric cars and busses have no impact, people complain about noise when living in downtown area. Game crashes frequently. FPS has improved over the updates, but still its nowhere near acceptable for a high end PC."
149650170,english,0,949230,"When they announced that the game would release with performance issues I was ready to refund it if the performance was truly bad enough. Gamestar magazine provided a savegame on release to test for performance in the late game. I tested the game using that savegame and found the performance to be good enough. After getting my own city to ~230k pop 50 hours into the game later, this still holds true.  There are so many things I love about this game. They really put a lot of love into the road building tools compared to CS1, I love how for example single lane highways connect into multi lane highways, or roads of different sizes connect into each other in general. I love how trams work. I love how footpaths work. I love the upgrade/feature system for customizing road sections. And we even got surface level subways in vanilla now! I love the detail that went into the economy. I love all the pretty little details you can spot when you zoom in. And I can clearly see that the devs had a lot of great ideas for this game and in a lot of places put a lot of love and effort into it.  However it is also clearly visible that in a lot of other places they didn't get to finish their work. Be that minor visual stuff like some kinds of parks or buildings not properly reacting to the weather and season like other things do. Missing animations for emergency vehicles. Or the fact that many of the systems are just completely bugged. Like the infinite garbage import that completly breaks your city in the late game. Or that they gave us so much to micromanage, but no way of getting any data, statistics or overlays for some of the things you could really deep dive in. Why can I not see the profitability of my individual public transport lines? Why can't I see wether or not my bus line is actually being used at night? Why can I not see how many vehicles I have in my depots vs how many are in use at a glance? Why is there no overlay to see where certain resources are used and produced? Why can I not manage import via cargo trains/planes/ships better? Why can I not see the origin and target location of cars/trucks/pedestrians on the map by simply clicking on the to get a better overview over where my traffic actually comes from? There are so many things that can be micromanaged but there is simply no data to base my decisions on other than clicking and tracking everything by hand. And in the end there is no real point in micromanaging everything in the first place, because the end game economy is basically just having infiinte money regardless of how much I manage my economy until it all falls apart because somehow the entire planet sends me their garbage for processing and my 10 incinerators, 6 recycling centers and 3 dumps are immediatly filled to the max, even when I have twice the amount of processing needed to process my own garbage and my entire city drowns in trash. I really tried to love this game and building up my first city really was a lot of fun. However I'm at a point where I see no point in further improving my city any more, because at any point the garbage problem or something else is gonna ruin it completly and all the improvements I could make don't really matter in the first place. And I see no point in creating another city, just to get to the same point.   When they announced the game would release with performance issues they didn't lie, but they forgot that the rest of the game isn't really finished either. And for a successor of the first game, it really needs the endless replayability, that just isn't there right now. It's not a bad game, but it is incomplete. This game would have needed another year of development or so, but sadly that just seems to be the industry standard now."
173755312,english,0,949230,"BACKSTORY I bought ""Cities: Skylines II"" knowing that the public's reception of the game has been largely negative since its release. I eventually decided to try it out for myself—to form my own opinion. The first game, ""Cities: Skylines,"" was great. I immediately fell in love with designing, building, and optimizing interchanges. After years of play well-supported by both the developer and an incredible modding community that furnished a robust Steam Workshop, the game began to show its age. Enabling a handful of specific mods became standard practice, and certain shortcomings that neither developer nor modder could overcome were revealed. This showed the community that there was room for a sequel of sorts, a second iteration of the game designed from the ground up with certain improvements and capabilities in mind.  Among the aforementioned mods were ""Move It,"" ""Network Anarchy,"" ""Precision Engineering,"" and ""Traffic Manager."" The tools and quality-of-life improvements these mods provided players in turn provided the developer a starting list of features the sequel should include.  MY EXPERIENCE To the developer's credit, many of these improvements made their way into ""Cities: Skylines II."" From a road-building perspective, the underlying code for how roads are managed seems to have received a nice rework and the game has some great new methods for constructing intersections and the like. Sadly, some of these features lack refinement. Some cause glitches while others simply don't behave quite how one might want. For example, connecting two roads *can* work out nicely, OR it can cause the steepest mountains (completely impervious to terraforming tools) to erupt from the median reaching for the heavens.  FINAL IMPRESSIONS All of this leaves the player passionately yearning for what is clearly possible, yet heartbroken seeing it left just out of reach. I think the game has great potential, but lacks polish. It feels unrefined and incomplete. I'm confident the playerbase will create mods to help, but the game will never reach its full potential without corrective action from the developer.  It is also worth noting that a newer, well-spec'd gaming laptop struggles at times to handle the game in its current state. I get the impression that the game is not optimized very well. For reference, I have been experiencing issues while running the game on an ""ROG Strix SCAR 16 (2023) G634"" (Product Name: G634JY-XS97) (SKU: 90NR0D91-M001B0).  Now, I, personally, am left with the decision between requesting a refund (before I sink too many hours into the game) and keeping the game (relying on the developer to fix it). Ultimately, I will likely keep the game in hopes that my purchase will help fund an effort to improve the game. However, if I was more strapped for cash, I would undoubtedly request a refund. At this time, I would recommend anyone tight on funds to abstain from purchasing this product."

I dont think i spent so much time and effort onto a city before just to lose it all. I would recommend this game but dont take it serious as any bs could happen. I might not be able to get the motivation to play again after this."
172054722,english,1,949230,"Good city builder but good god this game is poorly optimized. Be prepared for lots of sudden FPS drops. The economy and detailing updates have made it worth playing, although I would recommend picking it up on sale."
176459748,english,1,949230,"Recently started playing again after barely playing since launch. This game has its problems, but its still fun to play. While it is missing some features that were present (and highly useful) in the first game, the new features from this game like mixed/medium zoning and the road building are very fun to play with. The graphics improvement is also noticeable if you have a good enough machine to take advantage of it. It still isn't perfect, but this game has come a long way since launch."
190898660,english,0,949230,"Can you please stop releasing new content and fix the game, this new patch has literally done nothing to improve gameplay/QOL. Its getting embarrasing now. Still not playable! Traffic is still Mayham, cars have no real life direction"
175839538,english,1,949230,"I guess putting in 130 hours might be a sign that I really enjoy it... and I do! It had a rocky start with quite a few bugs that needed to be ironed out, but now it's much more playable, especially since the 'high rent' bug has been fixed. I do wish there was an option to toggle off icons in general—maybe there’s a mod for that, though I prefer playing unmodded for now. There are definitely some features from the first game that I wish would make their way into this one, like toll roads, and it would be great if disasters were made even more disastrous.  I like that they’ve made this version more challenging compared to how it felt at launch. Initially, it felt too easy, and I advanced through all the milestones quickly. However, what I still don’t like—and maybe I’m just bad at it—is dealing with traffic. No matter what I try, I can't seem to fully eliminate it.  If you enjoyed the first one and are still on the fence, I think it's time to jump off and give this one a try."

162377447,english,0,949230,"I am sure that this has been repeated ad nauseam in the reviews for this game, but if it had not been for SimCity 2013's disastrous release, the degree of popularity that the Cities: Skylines franchise has attained would simply not exist. One would think that, nearly on that game's tenth anniversary, it might be in mind for executives when determining a release schedule for their game.  Why did Cities: Skylines 1 succeed where SimCity 2013 did not? Simply put, it was unlimited where SC2013 imposed limits. There are many examples of this that you have probably heard before: community content, map size, one-way roads, yada yada. Why is it, then, that some the very things that helped spur the popularity of CSL1 in the first place not the first priority in a full new release?   This is all stuff you've heard before. What I have not heard nearly enough people talking about is that this game seriously lacks charm compared to its predecessors. I admit this is quite subjective, but hear me out. Like it or not, the donut vans and obnoxious sirens of the first game are iconic and goofy, and felt like they gave the game a charming identity; an unrealistic identity, perhaps, but it had spirit. It also had outrageous ploppables, like the Hadron Collider, in case you wanted to embrace your unrealistic side. SimCity 2013, lest we forget, had quirky thought bubbles, a poorly-disguised advertisement for Progressive Insurance, the 100% Electric Nissan Leaf, the whole future expansion that changed literally every zone?? and, on a more sincere note, the most fitting music for a city builder that I've ever heard, ever. There's a reason why the SimCity 2013 music pack for CSL1 was popular (no shade intended, that is hard to follow up). What is the identity of this specific game? Spasm Electronics?  I will give credit where credit is due. The road system of this game is vastly improved over Cities: Skylines 1, as are the building and vehicle models. I prefer the zoning categorization in this game, as it is a major step up in realism. The North American style does feel pretty American (anyone remember Roads United and that whole fisaco?). Roundabout support is very nice. The tree growth and seasons are nice, and adds value to every tree you place down.   The developers of this game are good people and I believe that they wanted to make a good and fully fleshed out game. I believe strongly that they just needed more development time to create a proper sequel, or they needed to release this game in early access, like many others have already suggested. One day I hope to revisit this game once it is in a more playable state, but I am worried that it will never get there, for me."
174677705,english,1,949230,"It is already a very good game and has tons of potential. I think it already surpasses CS 1 and is getting many updates, which is great from the devs. Despite the terrible launch, it has recovered very well and is set for many great things in the future."
148873180,english,0,949230,"Tough One  Long time CS1 fan but CS2 leaves me feeling both impressed at how much the engine has come on and disappointed at how much has been lost.   Firstly kudos to CO for at least warning us that the game was un-optimised, but, looking around at recent history should have told CO that this was an opportunity (However annoyed it may have left fans) for them to delay this release by a few months more to get it into a fit state.   After 15 hours of playtime on the sequel I feel confident enough (With a city of 110k) to review the game fairly.   So firstly the pro's  + Game engine is much improved, buildings look better, animations are much better (For the most part)  + The sims feel much more alive, you see them travelling and periods such as rush hour are now accurately reflected as opposed to CS1 where roads would grind to a halt anytime of day, which leads on to... + The road layout tool is vastly improved, at first it may look like its a simplified version of what we had in CS1 but there are powerful tools underneath the initial views that allow you to control many more aspects of the road layout, the AI also uses roads in a much more common sense way. changing lanes and trying to avoid jams + European and North American options for the most part (Apart from low density habs) look sufficiently different, although things like trains and some lorries are not localised with big old american trains for cargo spoiling some of the immersion  + Development points is a win, replacing the standard unlocks as you grow your city you can now select particular buildings or service in the order you want to, it makes for different playthroughs and options each time and gives you more control over areas to focus on in city development, a major improvement over CS1 + Slightly stolen from the last Simcity but the ability to upgrade existing service buildings is a welcome addition, rather than having to plop 10 different small police stations across your city you can now typically get away with one or two and simply upgrade them with larger garages or improved services. The majority of the time its cheaper than buying a new building and increases the coverage area, which reminds me + The service coverage area for most service buildings is far more generous now, gone are the days of having to plan to build 3 elementary schools all within the same area of your city because of their laughable service coverage zone. Service buildings now cover significant parts of the map. I did the earlier to mid-game with the very first police and fire stations you unlocked until I got to a pop of around 25k, impossible in CS1 without the city resembling a Friday night out in Essex  Now the negatives - Its day 2 of release so mods will come but right now the game feels sparse, minimal buildings and options for many of the different types of service such as schools and police means once you've unlocked one or two lines of each services development section you've pretty much seen it all,  I'm really hoping those of us who invested heavily in DLC for CS1 aren't going to be stung by countless additional DLC that simply should be in the base game to start with. Its pretty weak currently and once you've unlocked most things there isn't a great deal to do beyond continuing to grow your city with the same buildings - The game should have released with the creation kit and mods good to go. If they can bung free copies to 'influencers' to try and butter us all up over the last few weeks they could have done the same for the actual valuable members of the CS community aka the modders. It would have left the launch feeling much less sparse. On the subject of modding, i'm not precious about steam workshop or their own version of it, I would have just liked to have seen mods here at the start to make up for the lack of content  - Pathing whilst vastly improved is still an issue later in city growth. get above 80k pop in a decent size city and regardless of improving your roads, the AI seems to have a fit and forget all of the smart stuff its been doing up to this point and rely on the same core roads and pathing as opposed to the countless other options I tried to put in place for them to use. Which reminds me...  - Public transport feels generally broken at the minute. In a city of 110k I have 1% using buses (Despite very generous spreading of stops across my city, 0% using trams, 1% using the subway and 0% using my passenger trains. Seems pretty pointless, very expensive and totally contributes to the snarling up of the road network. Definitely contributes to the end game making you feel like you are just constantly firefighting the road network than actually city planning and needs to be patched urgently - The UI is pretty awful, everything from setting bus lines to the size of menu screens and the lack of customisation around being able to move with the mouse all feels weak at the moment and less than what we had in CS1. Its frustrating when you are laying out a transport line and suddenly a menu pops on screen and deletes all of the progress you've been making laying out your line. - I'll talk about optimisation more generally below but stability wise I've had one crash (My rig details below) but most important point here, for some unknown reason autosave is switched off by default, which in a game like this where hours of work could be lost to a crash seems insane to me, make sure its the first option you switch on and to the devs I'd strongly urge you to have this switched to on by default.   Optimisation  Ok, the big one.  Firstly kudos to CO for admitting they had a problem, but that admittance should have led to them doing the right thing for their customers and delaying the release, but hey, we live in a shareholder driven world so needs must I guess.   Optimisation is extremely poor depending on your hardware choices, what this means looking at the steam hardware survey is that 99% of people will not have a game that feels next gen when they play. CO have themselves advised switching off a bunch of graphical options to get a decent framerate and whilst this isn't Call of Duty where frames = better, the standard in 2023 should be having the game run at a minimum of 60FPS for the VAST MAJORITY of users. This unfortunately won't be the case for many many people.   So, things to make your experience more stable (if less pretty)  - switch off depth of field - 10-20 FPS improvement - switch off Vsync - same sort of frame gain as depth of field - try flicking between borderless window and fullscreen, some are reporting frame gains of between 5-10 fps - run it in 1080p if you have to - can give you 20fps or more - switch off all of the volumetric options - 10-20 fps   All of the above is obviously dependent on your own hardware setup but on mine (I-9 12900k, RTX 3080 TI 12GB and 64GB DDR5 RAM i've been seeing a stable(ish) framerate of 68-85 fps with a pop of 110k running in 4k.   Your own experiences may vary and i'm not disagreeing that some folks with better hardware than me are having a worse time than I have and this simply reinforces the point that optimisation does seem to be all over the place at the minute.   In summary though, its not good enough, when people with £5k rigs are having to switch graphical options off for a game that isn't a FPS, then something is quite clearly badly wrong in how its been built and delivered to its users.   The hope of course is over the coming days and weeks the game will be patched. But that still isn't good enough for a £41 game that many folks have been pre-ordering and building up to for most of this year. Sure it would have been annoying to delay it by another month or two but it would have earned CO a significant bit of kudos and support from the community rather than the review bombing and open hostility we have now.   In summary then, its ok, but for those with weaker rigs, avoid for now and wait for patches to come. I'm pretty disappointed"

192079570,english,0,949230,"I give up. This hurts because I really enjoy playing this game (when it works properly) and I've owned it since its release. Since the beginning I've dealt with periods of desktop crashes, thank goodness for auto save. Then we'll chug along for a while without crashes. New update comes out, crashes return. Now I get some system log error every time I boot up the game. I've read forums, I've combed through steam, I've uninstalled and reinstalled 5 times now - it won't go away. Supposedly there's a fix but you have to comb through a folder of never ending files, download additional software to identify the failure and then reformat the file. Look, I just want to play the game. I shouldn't have to become a software engineer to play  a game I spent decent money on. I don't know what's going on over at Colossal Order or Paradox, but they need to get their heads out of where the sun doesn't shine. Both entities should be embarrassed.

I've since purchased it again and, with the mods available, I've been enjoying it. The performance has improved greatly for me and so it's been worth it HOWEVER, I must have missed the memo about auto-save being OFF BY DEFAULT and lost 8 hours of game-play when it crashed. I hadn't had any crashes up to that point so I guess it was pretty stable. I do recommend the game but I think there are some really basics things missed. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
148958095,english,0,949230,"a great many reviews so far, both positive and negative, seem to center around performance. while it's definitely true CO shit the bed a bit here, for most people these issues are fairly surmountable (if not still having enough annoying present issues like stuttering for those same users). so i feel compelled to counterbalance that by listing an assortment of the the much deeper shameful issues/annoyances in this sequel  - the improved traffic pathing would really be more appreciable if the ""lifepath"" of cims seemed to matter all that much. there are distinct periods of high (rush hour) and low utilization, but in terms of actual behaviors, cims interact illogically (park at location very briefly before leaving immediately), sparingly, or often not at all - i know this is a complete rewrite of the game compared to C:S1, but how exactly did water physics manage to regress *this* badly? relatedly, don't waste your money on a hydro dam, as it appears to be wholly non-functional for power at this point... - ...or *do* waste money on your hydro dam because it actually doesn't matter—the game economy is opaque at best and non-functional at worst. i'm not sure if people are correct in reporting a *complete absence* of logistics mechanics, but it seems like colossal order have so little confidence in this area of the game that businesses/industries can get by on an excess of goods being teleported/freely spawned in their inventories while also potentially suffering from a lack of customers and continue for an incredibly long time without ever going out of business. i've seen a couple people successfully export goods, but most people report their air/sea/train cargo connections never loading a single thing, while other people report businesses that have no outside road connection whatsoever still remaining in business, so something is seriously broken in all of this. (also good luck getting your commercial plots to ever level up with their ceaseless moaning for customers) - you will frequently struggle to maintain a surplus, probably due in no small part to economic silliness. for most people, they probably are overbuilding services, but it is regardless more difficult than it probably should be. not to worry, though: CO have effectively papered over this by giving you particularly sizable cash bonuses every time you level up in the progression system. unless you've been running a deficit with no profits and few milestones for a while, you're unlikely to ever end up in a penny-pinching situation. this was also true to a large extent in the original game, but that was more because the economy was *easy* rather than due to it being fudged - dealing aesthetically with lots/roads on terrain in C:S1 was never especially fun, yet here we have also managed to regress massively from ""ugly"" to ""looks like a geometry error even if it's not"". actually, building on terrain has gotten worse mechanically in general as well. twice as many slope errors (and twice as easily/sensitively), quays/bridges yelling ""it's in water"" at the drop of a hat for infrastructure *literally meant to be proximate to water*, even if you get a road right on terrain there's a good chance you get stuck with a disgusting retaining wall setup, etc. - C:S2 got us all excited for increased ability to build non-car-dependent cities, in contrast to the original... then what we get instead (besides small ped paths that work similar to the original) is a single type of ugly, wide(!) pedestrian street that pedestrians don't properly utilize (maybe due to aforementioned issues with their day-to-day behavior?), but *CARS* DO LOVE TO UTILIZE (Lmao), especially if you zone commercial along it (like one normally would do with pedestrian neighborhoods). a lot of those commercial lots will end up being gas stations, too. i almost can't be mad at this one because it's so whimsical - further frustrating your plans for a beautiful ~modern and sensible urbanist~ city plan is the fact that it is remarkably difficult to ever push your cims into utilizing the public transit you very considerately built for them. not impossible, but far more often than not you'll see marginal utilization on decent routes. also, remember how i mentioned ped pathways/streets? in your quest to wean off car dependence, you won't see a single bicycle on said pathways. maybe that's just me personally taking offense as a cyclist, but it's yet another inexplicable regression from the original game - roads are, as everybody have noted, MASSIVELY improved in almost every practical way, yet often beyond what a seasoned player might expect. snapping is, all at once, too weak and too strong (depending on context). zoning plots becomes a planner's nightmare as you'll draw out a grid that is composed of perfect 90 degree angles and still get misaligned plots between the roads - expecting all DLC functionality to be in this as sequel is not realistic, but—i'm gonna use this word yet again—the absolute regression here in campus areas, park areas, district zone specialization (besides industry), etc. is pretty gaping - on release of the original basegame, the hyped-up ""district/city policies"" system was a little underwhelming as far as what you could really do with it (and it was only after several DLC that the policies menu had any flesh on its bones). it looks like an absolute abundance compared to the 6 or 7 policies they've given us here lol - i've made peace with the decision to not use steam workshop in favor of (still-unreleased) Paradox Mods but that doesn't mean i don't still think it's stupid and as an imposition upon this game it's just another feeble gasp from the increasingly frail, wheezing body of paradox interactive ever since they went publicly-traded - other cosmetic gripes. there isn't even a tasteful fog to obscure how ugly the borders of the playable map are. all vegetation and any non-sea water (like rivers and lakes) suddenly, visibly do not exist beyond the playable boundary, as do roads—they couldn't even bother with something that kind of resembles a road going off into the distance. the really funny thing is, i've seen (on the Tampere map at least) that trees *can* still render beyond the playable area and some scatter into it for tree clusters on the borderlines. they were just too lazy to add any garnish to this area otherwise. which doesn't really make you want to make use of the nearby playable area lol - death by 1000 cuts. so much across both major and minor functionality is either practically inoperative, fairly broken, or at least a little broken/unbalanced/inconsistent, including: > postboxes don't really seem to work. the postal system does (i think). just not postboxes. there's a lot of issues in other systems that are flat-out silly just like this > road-naming and what the game considers a distinct road is all screwed up. i've had entire grid neighborhoods have 80% of said grid's roads considered one contiguous road. and if you build off a road, you never know how radically the game will shift what it considers to be part of the old road or a new road entirely. custom road names are not protected in this process and you will lose your custom names extremely easily. at this rate i'd rather just pretend road names don't exist anymore and hide them, but hiding labels is not an option (which it was in C:S1) > seasonal cycles cannot be disabled and you cannot simply go to a climate that does not have seasonal cycles, because all maps/map themes are in temperate northern hemispheric climates anyway. your winter wonderland will quickly become a snowy nightmare"
157427763,english,0,949230,"At its current state, no I wouldn’t recommend it. The game is full of bugs, bad performance and the biggest part of its problem is the lack of content.

148820365,english,0,949230,"Sadly this review is negative.   The performance is just unacceptable, there are some rendering issues plaguing the game, and on top of that there are some wildly unoptimized assets in this game.  From small guard shacks with modeled out wires, computers and keyboards to the horrendous looking procedural generated citizens that far exceed even some larger buildings in triangle count, they are a waste of computer resources.  The whole unecessary addition of a ''citizen lifepath'' is something very few players asked for, and its clear part of the issues with this game relate to choises made during development of the game.   The truth is, these citizen models look so hideous that they dont even invite you to engage with the lifepath mechanic at all, id rather have they were significantly reduced in detail, or replaced by assets modeled by an actual artist, and not a procgen program, before i would consider paying attention to the ''lifepath'' stuff this game offers.  I wanted to love this game, and in a way i still do, everything else Cities Skylines 1 did is improved in 2, but the terrible performance, and questionable looking assets really ruin the hype for me.   Also, this game has a launcher, and just like the 1st game, its totally unnecessary and offers no utility whatsoever, beyond serving advertisements to you for Nvidia.  This review might change to positive if the optimisation is adressed in the future, and the ability to mod the horrendous looking potatoheads is added..... Before then, if you are not brand loyalist like me, stick to the first game a while longer, this game needs a couple more months in the oven.  Edit: Further thoughts:  After longer play A noticeable issue is that Residential zoning demand is based on *density* not on *affordability*  Wealth does not factor much in where a citizen will move in as much as density type does.  This results in the player having to build an insane amount of low density zoning, even though denser apartment building types would be preferred and more efficient, limiting your planning abilities and creativity.  The game will complain about there being a ''housing crisis'' when the real problem is that citizens will not move into denser buildings.   City policies are negligible and can no longer be applied globally, instead having to be set per district.   Building upgrades are a great mechanic however.   Virtual texturing/texture streaming seems to struggle with alpha mapped objects (primarily hedges) causing them to look cubical with flat 2d planes sticking out of them. This happens even with less performance intensive cities.    Edit: Specs  GPU: GTX 1070TI  CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X   RAM 32GB  My settings: everything set to medium, disabled volumetrics, DOF and Motion blur. 70% resolution scaling.  Average FPS zoomed in: 30  Average FPS at range: 25/20   Population in city used for benchmark: 100.000"

156405585,english,0,949230,"After spending almost 150 hours in this game it’s safe to say I’ve given up.  I’ve mostly ignored all the comments at first so that I can give an impartial view of this game.   Foremost, Cities Skylines 2 is broken. It is riddled with many serious algorithmic and performance bugs that affect core functions of the game. Widely reported bugs such as frequent crashes and taxation glitch, which causes unexpected income and deficit spikes that breaks the gameplay — and this is just one of many serious ones out there   While it is understandable for bugs to be present in games and software, Colossal Order’s lack of urgency and genuine interest in tackling bug reports makes it unacceptable.   It’s been 3 months since launch, yet recent statements from the company were deliberate in evading questions on roadmaps for bug fixes, and attempt to obfuscate users by saying that something is being worked on for the near future.   Hard to believe that this is the same company that made Cities Skylines 1 — a realisation of what the company once was. For now, stay away until more is done.   —  (Quick update — 29 Jan)  I’ve given this game another shot with a fresh install and a new city — issues remain and let me summarize my experience  - At first glance, Cities Skylines 2 provides many quality-of-life improvements compared to Cities Skylines 1, such as better road building and modern assets.  - You’ll find that it is now a breeze to build roads, highways and intersections, tools are intuitive and easy to use. Want an intersection? Just drag across an existing road and you’ll have an intersection. Want a roundabout? Just plop it down.  - Assets are refreshed as compared Cities Skylines 1, gone are the cartoonish buildings and vehicles.   However, most of the gamebreaking issues start occurring as you progress into the game.   Game stability and optimization - As your population increases, game simulation will slow to a crawl — despite my setup being well above the recommended specs  - Occurs on my two different cities and save files.   Service Mechanics - Garbage management and healthcare vehicles will regularly depart from their facility and return almost immediately (alerts will popup frequently that healthcare and garbage management is inadequate despite well within their capacity) - Buses, trams and trains will frequently and randomly despawn or stop working completely.   Economy and industry - Taxation for industries will become highly erratic due to an algorithmic bug, taxation income will fluctuate randomly by the millions for a town of 10k citizens. Completely breaks the budgeting and financial system.  - Local industries will not export goods, cargo terminals (both air and train) will hoard all mail and breaking the mailing system (also impacts citizen happiness) - As confirmed by many others, due to a land value bug, prices will increase to astronomical levels, which makes residential suitability zero for most parts of your city and its outer suburbs.  - This the most critical bug since it completely stops the progress of your city and game, as residential demand will be zero, and no new citizens can move in.   These are just some of the numerous bugs I came across while playing this game —  you do find yourself having to look up online for any workarounds whenever you come across one.   While I’m almost certain that these issues will be addressed eventually in the future.. but is this what it is expected of a published game that cost $50? Was this game ready to be published in the first place?   After two gameplays and two cities, one thing is certain for me — Cities Skylines 2 would not have passed QA and should not have been published in the state it is in. This game is in beta."
162086856,english,0,949230,"Generally speaking I don't like to do reviews, I know they're beneficial for the community and they help buyers decide, but return policies exist for a reason, and that reason is so that people can try it, decide if they like it on their own, and then return it.  That being said, when something is in such a state of horror that it defies logic, I think it's my duty to save you, the reader, from making the same mistake I did...  I have been playing City Builder games since before a lot of you were born, I started with the first Sim City in 1989 and have been an avid fan of the genre ever since.  I love how the genre evolved over time and the games became more complex and at the same time more rewarding.  It's my idea of a perfect saturday afternoon, sitting down, listening to some chill music, and watching as my planning unfolds into this megalopolis that was in my head.  I love it so much that I had even started my 4-year-old daughter down the path by having her sit with me and picking and choosing where we placed certain things in Cities Skylines 1 and showing her how the different mods worked..  When I saw the advertisements for Cities Skylines 2 I foamed at the mouth with excitement, and my daughter was over the moon that we were going to get a new, better game that promised many more hours of enjoyment.  We decided to purchase the top package that guaranteed us the most bang for our buck and the not yet released but announced DLCs that would add stuff as we started a new city together.  We stayed home on game release day to make sure we were among the first to download and start building our new shiny city together.  Much to our dismay however, the game was slow, clunky and basically unplayable on a Threadripper 3960X w/ 128GB Of DDR4 and 2x RTX 3090's.  We were sad to say the least, but we still had hope.    People started sharing settings, then official announcements came with other settings, and we finally stopped having 13fps and got it up to 30fps.  So it was playable, right?  Well, not really.  There was still masssive stutter from time to time, especially when inside of game menus... I mean, they're menus, why on earth are they causing the FPS to plummet and dropping dozens of frames?  It was, and still is so bad, that it randomly causes the USB to reset and the famous Windows chimes that tell you when a USB has disconnected, and reconnected play through the speakers.  And then a patch was announced that promised to fix some of the biggest problems with performance, so we stayed home again, only to be let down once again.  There was maybe a 5 percent performance increase overall, and the menu's were still causing massive game lag.  CO admitted fault and released patch after patch after patch in quick succession, that we were overjoyed that soon we would get to be able to enjoy the game...   But that time never came...    CO stopped patching, but promised that they would not release any of the DLC and more paid content until they got the base game right, because that is what was most important to them...  Another promise... another let down...  Now, not only did they release a paid DLC before fixing the game, they had to gall to charge $9.99 for it.  Bare in mind here, I paid for the deluxe edition, so it was ""free"" for me, but it also let me know how much extra I would really be getting for the extra money I spent, and it doesn't seem like much...   If I had one piece of advice for anyone looking to buy this game in its current state, it would be to run, very fast, in the opposite direction of your computer screen...  I cannot n good conscience recommend that anyone buy this game.  Instead, take your family out for a dinner, go see a movie, go spend your money on anything else, just don't buy this game.  I would recommend spending the night in a trap house or a shooting gallery before I would recommend you purchase this game...  So thanks Colossal Order, for not only stealing my money, but also disappointing my daughter...  Shame on you and Paradox interactive for releasing such a steaming pile of garbage..."
159724986,english,0,949230,"Cities: Skylines II - the game where everything is made up and nothing matters.   Its the game equivalent of the DJ pushing all kind of buttons on his mixer that is not plugged in while an mp3 just plays on his ipod.   Do not spend money on the game in its current state if you expect a city builder that actually simulates the behaviour and movement of people and  goods. Right now the game is just a tool to build something that looks visually like a city but has no inner logic or function. People and vehicles are just animated background noise. Their behaviour barely influences any important metric and all your game play decisions don't influences them alt all. A few examples:  - I build a ore mine on an island with no road connection. Before i could even finish the passenger ship connection there are 60 workers employed at the mine that must have swam over there. I finish the ship connection but not a single physical person steps onto the island. Looking at the stats the mine is producing a couple hundred tons of ore per month. Not a single truck moves anything out of the mine to the cargo terminal.   WHY DO I BUILD A PASSENGER AND CARGO CONNECTIONS WHEN PEOPLE AND PHYSICAL GOODS DO NOT EVEN NEED THEM?? IN A CITY BUILDING GAME THAT IS ALL ABOUT MANAGING THE FLOW OF PEOPLE AND GOODS???  - Because the animated people and cars/trucks that you see in the game have absolutely no influence if your city works or not all your game play decisions have no real consequences. You would think if you build a shitty city where people are stuck in traffic and cant get to work there will be a negative consequence. But because the person doesnt need to be physically present at work it matters zero if you build a highway from their door to the office or have no physical connection at all. There is no motivation to do anything because there is no consequences either way.  - The people physically present in the game do not behave in a way that is understandable. You click on a random person just getting of the train leaving the station to find out that they are going to work on the other end of the map where the train just came from. because there is no way to show the actual path you have no clue why they took the train away from their destination.  - even if we ignore that the game has no internal logic and rules your still building ghost towns. my current build of 10k people looks like a big city with highrises and all but there are maybe 1/10th of the actual people around. no real traffic problems because there are very few cars around. If you think that is because of public transportation think again, busses trams and co have mostly 1 -5% utilisation. The industry that is on paper producing thousand tons of goods have the occasional truck driving around.   - rush hour does not work at all. All streets have a graph that shows the traffic flow over the course of the day and every single road has a flat line that does not vary depending on time. If you have only every tenth person on the road at least have them leave their house all at the same time.  In conclusion I'm very disappointed that they spend so much time to develop a super complex ""simulation"" and then decided that non of it actually matters. It feels you are looking at a animated picture of a city while there is a complicated excel spreadsheet  on the other monitor crushing random number and they hope you are dumb enough not to notice that they have nothing to do with each other."
181467107,english,0,949230,"To put it fairly, Cities: Skylines II isn't bad because it's abandoned or given any false promises. But rather, while there is indeed significant effort after release to fix and improve the game, the disastrous release has still left mountains of problems unresolved. And now while the game is probably at 60% confidence for [i]release[/i], it's already resuming selling cosmetics for coins, which is why I have to add a thumb down to it.  The disaster of CS2 is a combination of over ambition, terrible risk management and project planning. This game was built on weak foundations and has been heavily misdirected to keep stacking on it - namely, the economy simulation.   CS2's key feature and improvement over CS1 is the much more in-depth economy system with individual level citizen needs and more types of supply & demand. The bad news is this system has never worked. They started with embedding fake dummy figures to make it [i]look [/i]functional, then, after being picked out by players, reworked the math two or three times (I lost count if we are at economy 2.0 or 3.0). [b][i]It still does not work. [/i][/b] And more crucially, players have little to no way to make it work.   There are only very limited micro management tools which makes 80% of the stat charts in the game pointless - you can stare at them, but there is no way to respond to them. What's the point of having dozens of industry types when I can't even assign a district or building to a specific industry? What's the point of having a patch to ""give more salary to employees"" instead of making it something adjustable (e.g. minimum wage or income tax rate) in the first place?  CS2 essentially introduced an overly complex model to replace what's trivial but working in CS1, to achieve the exact same goal - to generate district demands - but failed to provide enough tools to players to integrate it as part of gameplay. There are so many gaps and vacancies between this simulation and the actual gameplay, that are either reserved for DLCs or simply overlooked. However, instead of filling the gaps by providing more policy tools,  more specialized city service types etc, the devs have only been cooking and recooking the math of the simulation... which is quite pointless.   This makes CS2 not qualify for a city simulation game. It's at best a [i]scene building [/i]game that is no way worth $40. Adding on with the performance downfalls, the modding dramas, and the unending list of [i]small [/i]bugs - all lead to the very same question: [b]why would you release the game in 2023, if it is still not ready after one year?[/b]"
160957874,english,0,949230,"I say this with no hyperbole, this game is so bafflingly bad it arguably has destroyed Colossal Order's reputation.  Cities: Skylines 1 arguably revived the city building genre and was a critical darling. It had flaws, but it was at its core a product with legs and heart behind it, and its community was well earned.  Cities: Skylines 2 feels like a cheap mobile game, like World Box or something, where you just place objects and get pretty views.  On the one hand, a lot of people play Cities as more of a model set rather than mechanical game, so in some ways Cities 2 is 'better' because you can get a prettier view... but the default assets often are very repetitive and you can't currently mod in anything to get variety or to customize your city, and many of the mechanical aspects of the game dramatically interfere with making a city that looks just the way you want it. So while you can get some good shots that look sort of like a real city, you can't get some of those magical moments you can in Cities 1 where you set up everything juuuust right and have created a city of your dreams.  So the game launched without real custom cities, but it could lean on its simulation aspects... if it had any.   Cities 2 promised to up the fidelity of the simulation to, frankly, silly and unbelievable levels. I never believed you would really be able to follow individual cims and see that they have a cohesive life, so the fact that doesn't actually work is fine. The idea of trying to accurately model and track literally tens of thousands of interacting agents is stupid.  The problem is almost no simulated element actually works. Cities 1 took a lot of shortcuts for its simulation, but it had an internal logic that made sense and facilitated the core challenge of a city builder: conflicting needs of different types of activity in a city putting pressure on your ability to lay things out and connect them, because while things didn't have formalized connections, you still had a clear logic of what sort of resource would be demanded by what zone you plop, and where they were likely to come from. Did it make sense that the industry building that was nominally making phones would receive raw meat and then ship out their finished products to a commercial building that was a donut shop? No. But on the macro level you understood that resources need to go to specific refineries, which then go to industry zones based on distance, which then created abstract goods that needed to get to commercial zones while generating traffit.   Cities 2 has a detailed economy that tracks companies, specific industries and supply chains, supply and demand, production, ect... and... it doesn't work. Its a downgrade from 1.... because goods just teleport. You literally don't need to do anything. The game has all these bars and graphs that SAY 'X industry needs more ore products' but you don't actually need to ensure they can get them, and that makes sense because you can't actually set up things on that specific industry level anyway, so even if the system worked it would be a nightmare... but instead it just doesn't work at all and you can just toss anything anywhere at any time and basically not care because people and goods can teleport in a game primarily about connecting zones.  This isn't even going over bugs like with education. The core concepts of Cities 2 don't really make sense, which is why I am not surprised they are fake, but its baffling that in a game for simulation nerds they would ship something so transparently broken and non-functional and worse than 1... when they could have just made a simulation like 1's with maybe more detail on industries, better road making tools, and the new density system. Its just so confusing why the game is like this and why they just made something that doesn't work, and never likely will work.  Just play Cities 1."
149590916,english,0,949230,"Beware: traffic simulation, economy simulation, and sim life simulation are not designed to work together   Bought the game. Performance issues, not a big deal, it will get sorted. Playing along, about 15 hours in you realize the ""deep simulation"" is fake. Initially I realized there was a cargo bug. Nothing was getting exported via harbors or train or air cargo terminals. Although that itself was bugged, it revealed a HUGE issue that was put in by design. Turns out, the traffic simulation, the economy simulation, and the sim life simulation are all not connected to each other, which makes them all not really impressive at all. Sims have jobs, but don't actually have to go to work. (Same with school) Businesses need goods to operate, but don't actually need them to be exported or imported by the road system. You can have an industrial zone without any connections to the outside or the rest of your city and the economy side of things will work without issue via magical teleportation of goods and workers, in a game that is supposed to model traffic and ""create rush hours as your sims go about their lives"". Uhh, yeah, sure CO.   ""deep simulation"" they said over and over again.  I feel deceived on this one, and quite frustrated that I didn't realize it was all disconnected until past the refund period.  What the heck CO, I expected better than this.   Feels like they couldn't get it all to work together and just released it anyway. Or the marketing team and the development team never talk to each other. Wow..."

The game is in a pre-alpha version compared to what should have been and will be for a long, long time given the current ""development"" progress  ❗️❗️❗️ 24/03/2025 UPDATE because I want to address some of the comments and also mainly because I'm genuinely getting even more pissed off with this game, every time I'm getting back to it.  🔴 Regarding some most usual comments, @qG_CeRTiiFieD and @Saukuy already addressed them in the below section, so I will just paste them here. If there's a way to pin them or anything please let me know, so I can give more credit to these guys:  ""They're still working on it."" -It's been a year after release. Stop giving companies grace for releasing broken products. YOU are the reason why they keep doing it.  ""Your PC is trash."" -First of all, doesn't at all address 6/8 points provided. And for the only two it MIGHT address... this is a commonly reported issue with the game. Talk about fallacy. - personally I just want to add, for comparison, that I'm running KCD2 or Cyberpunk smoothly on very high settings, whilst my recommended setings for CS2 are low/very low...  ""Why did you play it for 176 hours"" -90% of reviews are from people who barely get past the introduction and then provide poor unhelpful feedback that doesn't actually tell potential users anything of note.  ""Try not comparing a ten year old game's content compared to a one year old game"" - All about the value proposition. If the game doesn't adequately innovate mechanics, while also offering substantially less than a previous iteration - what is the point of getting the new game?  🔴 As for the things that I have ommited previously and that make me pissed off even more (even though the game is objectively getting better of course):  - I can't stress it out enough how terrible the pathfinding is.  - Poor graphics - I mean honestly, the game is newer, but is it really better looking? Grass textures are hideous, we have cartoonish cars, bland and simply sad colors and design of many buildings. CS2 was released the same year as Baldur’s Gate 3, Hogwarts Legacy, Alan Wake 2 or Lies of P. Would you have guessed it? Absolutely not, UI is better and it's easier to build things, but that only distracts from the simple fact that the game is ugly. Jesus, compare it to Manor Lords...  - Texture clipping, uneven road zoning, incomprehensible downcasts or road shading, misterious holes in the terrain adjacent to the structures, in other words dozens of minor errors that you spend a solid hour trying to fix because they sting your eyes and you'll go crazy until you fix them  - Lack of many tools that would mimic CS1's absolutely essential mods, like Traffic Manager or Intersection Marking Tool for example. Jesus, we still can create much better organised and more detailed intersections in CS1 than here. How they couldn't simply include at least the first 3 pages of most popular CS1 mods in the new game? The receipe for a success was so simple...  - Still no bikes, quays, just a few types of roads and intersections etc. - again, JESUS CHRIST IT'S A SEQUEL AND THEY CUT OUT SO MUCH CONTENT, THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.  - Related to the previous sub-item - promenades? PAID DLC. Almost any leisure and entertainment? PAID DLC. A few modern buildings? PAID DLC. Any region pack, after adding just a few most basic ones? PAID DLCs.  Disgusting."
180847633,english,0,949230,"City Skylines 2: A Huge Step Backward!!!  I’ve been a dedicated fan of City Skylines 1, pouring over 1,200 hours into that game and thoroughly enjoying every moment of city-building and management. Naturally, I was excited for City Skylines 2, and despite the initial mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance. After spending 250+ hours trying to immerse myself in this sequel, I can confidently say it’s been a MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Last night was the FINAL STRAW. I played for about 4 hours, carefully building my city and manually saving my progress multiple times to ensure nothing would be lost. Yet, during my final save, the game CRASHED. I didn't check the game archive at the time, because that's the kind of thing I'm USED TO. (Well done, City Skylines 2 team—you’ve successfully conditioned players to lower their expectations and tolerate glaring mistakes as if they were just part of the package.) When I reopened it today, all my save FILES were COMPLETELY GONE. Everything I worked on vanished as if I had never played at all.  For a game that demands long-term planning and hours of investment, technical issues like crashes and save file corruption are UNFORGIVABLE. This is basic functionality, and the fact that such issues persist after the game’s launch is UNACCEPTABLE. While City Skylines 1 felt polished and reliable, its sequel feels like a rushed, buggy mess that UNDERMINES the player’s TRUST and PATIENCE.  Unless the developers address these critical issues immediately, I CAN NOT RECOMMEND City Skylines 2 to anyone. It’s A HEARTBREAKING STEP BACKWARD from a franchise I ONCE LOVED."
154958535,english,0,949230,"The game needs to be better optimised and grinds to a halt when you get a few hundred thousand population.  So many people saying ""but CS1 took 7 years to get to where it is"".   Then I suggest you don't buy this until 2031."
150341735,english,0,949230,"Hmm this is going to be a tough review.  Much like everyone else I was very excited by the game when they announced and showed it.   When I first starting playing it I was enjoying my time with it but as the hours rolled by I think for me at least for now I can't recommend this game in its current state.  Man I wanted to truly like this game and sometimes I still do but well...  A decent amount of the core features are improved, The graphics, style, road placement and management and UI but at the same time there is also quite a lot missing, barely improved or outright worse or missing.   For starters the game is buggy, certain systems don't quite work or are planned out poorly especially the import export stuff. Then there is performance.   Some people may excuse it but I for one certainly can't. Having personally worked in the Unity ecosystem for 5+ years I can personally say they dropped the ball here. The graphics are great, Truly but the design and optimisation is going to take a LOT to fix an I feel bad for the engineers behind the scenes.   As a fan and customer I personally feel there no reason this game should barely be lucky to hit 30fps at low-medium on the best system costing thousands of dollars on the market especially when in a lot of areas the overall simulation while mostly better then CS1 its not that much better tbh.   This is made even worse when you realise most of the maps lack a LOT of details that were in the previous entry including grass of all things.  That is not okay and other details overall you will find its just missing or lacking overall,   The service vehicles don't have animations, there is less variety to all of the npcs and AI compared to the first game, Everything is sadly very static in regards to the ""world"". Most of the AI is just going from A to B and you can't even see the direct path they are taking unlike the first game which makes management of traffic more annoying then it needs to be especially for a sequel.  I think pets work now, Pretty sure I've seen dogs clocking in or walking home which can be more easily noticed once you hit 100k civs, which yknow honestly is just a hilarious bug.   I have three civs in my city which have been standing still since 20k and are now old people, One of them fucking died and whenever I want a laugh I just check up on them. It is another funny bug.  Pretty sure dogs at launch floated as well.  A lot of my very smooth roads have clipping issues into the void below on the sides of them an issue I don't remember being present in CS1.  I found it really tough to make my city look and feel unique outside of tree placement and road and terrain layouts because the detailing is a feature that not only hasn't improved from the first game but is seriously much worse then CS1 and overly lacking.   From a distance everyone's creations look amazing but when you zoom in aside from the awesome sense of scale which is a positive here in a massive way everything is the fucking same and it just sucks. Somehow less variety then CS1 at release side by side which makes no sense.  Like fences really? I can't even place fences? or quay walls which were in the first game, I can't modify existing details within buildings? or rocks and benches, I can follow an NPCs ""life path"" but god forbid I wanna actually make the houses they live in somewhat unique outside of naming with the same or similar tools the devs used to make them.   There is also very little in terms of variety for zone types which is kind of sucks considering this is suppose to be a sequel and placing specific zone types at times can be very frustrating, Like sometimes a certain house type will spawn for 99% of an area then for whatever reason wont for no real reason, Don't like it? Just remove the roads and start over and hope it works for the 2nd time or 3rd.   Also no idea why a plopable Rico isn't here in the base game. The assets are there, LET ME CHOOSE THEM PLEASE.    As time has gone on I have found myself finding more things that are were present in the first game but for whatever reason are not here or worse many things which are not improved at all.   For a sequel this really only has minimal major improvements of the first and the things which are improved they can't really make up for what is either worse or about the same as the first game..  Lane management is barely improved and its very frustrating to say the least combined with the traffic AI.  At low pop its not so bad and honestly seems alright and they even have working suspension a cool small detail however once you get high up there the simulation starts to break and brain of the civs just goes out of the window, Its like suddenly at 60k and above everyone decided booze were for everyone!   I spent more time stumped at how brain dead the AI overall can be before attempting at trying to fix it.   I had massive traffic jams stretching for miles with my interchanges barely being used. When I zoomed in they were all turning last second in multiple lanes, Some would do U-turns sometimes more then once and just cause chaos which for me at least is made even worse as IRL I'm learning to drive right now and the AI is making decisions I don't think I would ever make in a car even if I was 10 years old. Its insane!   Not to mention services, I have found the new feature of making them district restricted quite useful which is a positive but it still hasn't fixed the AI, A dead person is waiting for transport right across the road from the cemetery... WHAT? They are lucky that meteors can't be thrown willy nilly like in CS1.    I think this needed at least another year in the oven and if that wasn't an option early access at discount, Would of been better for the brand, devs and community.  That isn't the worst of it though. For me its how they have responded the community initially and how they made sure to tell the creators before release not to mention the performance and giving them weird restrictions. They knew exactly what they were doing and did it anyway. From the announcement of the hardware requirements going up hidden in a larger message to banning a long time community member for valid criticism.   I think in time they can turn it around, They did pretty good with CS1 and I think fully realised that games potential to the engine and design limits. Here I think the concept is good its just the execution. The bones are here for a great game. A lot of the core systems are in place begging to be polished or in quite a few cases outright fixed especially in regards to the overall simulation and I do love the art style more this time around although more variety is needed. What I have experienced so far overall I can see the potential down the line but for now it is just not here yet sadly.   The more I play this game the more depressed I feel about what could have been yknow?.   I love some parts of it but some other parts I just loathe and get annoyed. I'm currently trying to make a very realistic city and I'm running into so many design limitations with the current tool-set compared to the first game without mods it just kind of sucks.   I overall feel very mixed. At times it can be really great and chill, Other times it can be the opposite.  Hopefully they can improve the overall performance, Fix all the major bugs & at times broken simulation, Add in the missing features that were present at the very least from base game in CS1 at launch and MAYBE just maybe we will have a good start to the sequel for DLCS, Free patches & overhauls for many years to come.  If you want a proper sequel look elsewhere or come back in a year. Its a fine game overall even with the issues just don't go in expecting greatness, Some parts or better, Most are the same and some are worse then the first game.  It isn't worth the full price, Not even close, 40 AUD max, 60 AUD with the extra content. 5/10 (great potential) ~ SirJarko  Maybe in a year it will be worth it? Lets hope"
171930650,english,1,949230,"[h2] Intro [/h2] While I really enjoy the modern take on city building, Cities: Skylines 2 falls short in several areas I hoped would be improved from [i]CS:1[/i]. Although some features have been enhanced, many aspects feel very similar to the previous installment. Below are my thoughts, the good, the bad and the ugly!  [h3]Passing Thoughts[/h3] If you’re wondering whether it’s worth playing at the moment: [b]Yes and No.[/b] If you’re looking for a modern city builder and don’t mind some rough edges, then yes, it’s worth trying. However, if you prefer a more polished experience and want to wait until the issues are resolved, then it’s best to hold off.  [h3]The Good[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Engaging Sim Life:[/b] Just like in [i]Cities 1[/i], watching your sims go about their daily lives is a pleasure. The new feature allowing you to track a sim throughout its lifespan is a welcome addition. [*] [b]Improved Road System:[/b] The revamped road-building tool, including slip lanes for highways and dedicated turning lanes, is a significant improvement. While these features could have been added via mods in [i]Cities 1[/i], it’s great to see them included in the base game. [*] [b]Enhanced City Services:[/b] Power, water, and sewage now travel underground, eliminating the spaghetti-like pipes of the previous game. Additionally, there are more city service buildings available, offering varied services to your sims. [*] [b]Expandable Buildings:[/b] Many buildings now come with extra modules to increase their capacity. For instance, schools can be expanded with additional buildings, which reduces the need for numerous schools and service buildings as seen in [i]Cities 1[/i]. [*] [b]Mixed-Use Zoning:[/b] This feature, which I wished for in [i]Cities 1[/i], is now officially supported in [i]Cities 2[/i]. [/list]  [h3]The Bad[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Stagnant Gameplay:[/b] The game doesn’t evolve with city size. Managing a small city feels identical to managing a large one, unlike other city builders that offer varied and evolving gameplay. [*] [b]Lack of Challenges:[/b] There are no significant constraints or meaningful decisions. Problems are typically solved by simply ""building more,"" making the gameplay feel repetitive and flat. [*] [b]Limited Improvement:[/b] Although certain features, like highways, have seen improvements, fundamental issues with the grid layout and overall gameplay remain. These issues appear too deeply embedded to be resolved without a major overhaul in a future installment. [/list]  [h3]The Ugly[/h3] [list] [*] [b]Modding Platform Shift:[/b] Moving from the Steam Workshop to a third-party [i]'Paradox Mods'[/i] platform is a poor decision. Despite some solid features, this change detracts from the ease of modding that the first game provided. [*] [b]Poor Aesthetics: [/b]The grid-based design and focus on American urban sprawl lead to bland, unattractive cities. Specialized industry zones and modern industry representations are particularly weak, resulting in uninspired city layouts unless you sacrifice density. [*] [b]Bugs:[/b] The game still has several significant bugs, even after recent patches. For example, homeless people may remain indefinitely in your parks, which detracts from their intended use and overall enjoyment. Although the developers are aware of this issue, the lack of progress in addressing it is concerning. [/list]  [h3]Is It Worth It?[/h3] I wish Steam offered a middle-ground review option, rather than just ""Good"" or ""Bad."" While I enjoy the game, it remains quite rough around the edges. If you can tolerate some bugs and occasional issues, it might be worth trying. However, for most players, waiting [b]6 months+[/b] is probably the best option. Although I believe the game will have a long lifespan, I’m concerned that its poor initial reception might impact its future."

I would not recommend this game in it's current state, as it is buggy and does not work once the zombies take over (Note: This is not a zombie survival game).  UI			 	Roads will glitch when creating intersections, offramps, etc. (which is probably why they recently released a visual ""patch"" that allows adding pavement, etc.  	Your processing speed will slow down every time a zombie is created. How is a zombie created you may ask? Simple, if you purposely (or accidentally) destroy a building that houses any amount of people, those people will walk out to the street and just stand there, looking for a new place to live. But, since you most likely have an outside connection (*I even tried without an outside connection, still broken) those ""available"" homes will be taken by new people, and thus a zombie is created as ""Moving in"" or ""Idle"", if you destroyed a commercial zone, you create ""Shopping"" zombies. These citizens will stay in your city and slowly eat your processing power until your game speed of 3 is 10 minutes for an in game day to pass. Unsustainable, and game breaking (only the first of many game breaking issues with this game).  	Sometimes the weather works, and other times it does not and just ""glitches"" to the next day when it is sunny again.  Traffic			  	The AI doesn't respect lanes (no surprise that the AI still does not work when it comes to traffic), as they will turn in no turn lanes and do six to twelve point U-Turns wherever they can, multiple times. This is more common if you add or remove a road *anywhere* in your city, and it also happens when you add a sidewalk or crosswalk. This common task causes the AI to ""re-think"" and recalculate it's route, which causes them all to ""shift"" their routes.  		No individual lane control which means the dedicated turn lanes are determined by the angle of connecting the side roads, and a matter of one pixel will determine what the lanes do in response. Also, the traffic signals and signs are ""node"" specific, so there is no way to put a stop sign on just a sidestreet, etc., this was ""fixed"" in CS1 with mods.  	Cargo train stations are broken, they will not deliver goods between cargo stations, cargo airports, or cargo ships, and goods that are created locally from industry go no where, and commercial starts importing everything individually anyway, causing your industry to basically do nothing but create pollution.  	No weather related buildings (Heat, ice rink, sowplows, etc.), as they probably want money from a ""Snowfall"" like DLC from CS1	  Power/Water			  	Combustion banned zones should have increase power consumption, and there are no charging stations for EVs, only gas stations for fuel, ""Green Cities"" DLC?  	You can start a map importing power, but not water, so if you want to export water from the beginning tile you cannot (only for those that play with just 1 tile...)  	No water removing services, so enjoy those floods when you make a mistake.  Population			 		GAME BREAKING bug that I have no idea how it made it out of QA and passed Dev...zombie homeless just stand on the road taking up processing power, although some of them become homeless people that pay taxes and ""work"" but don't move into an available house or move out of your city (or actually ""go"" to work), and eventually become zombie robbers that kill your city...as mentioned earlier. This breaks your game in 1 way or another, I still don't understand how it made it out of Dev and QA and was released in this state. It is incredible how little it seems CO/Paradox cares anymore... 			 Healthcare			 	No deathcare	or childcare, probably want money from a ""Sunset Harbor""	like DLC from CS1  	The aforementioned zombies still negatively contribute to the overall health of the city, also killing your city, and when they get sick or die, healthcare and deathcare cannot ""pick"" them up so you get stuck with symbols flashing on your screen on of sick and dead homeless.  School			  	There are no preschools (or daycare) as mentioned earlier.  	No law school or dorms, probably want money from a ""Campus Life"" like DLC from CS1.  	More people ""stuck"" in building then ""eligible"" to be there, zombies live in schools and other buildings so even if a certain amount of people are eligible to go to school, they can't because every school is completely filled, until you have a map that is just elementary schools.  	Educated sims still become Robbers at an incredible rate, and soon you will have a city of Well-Educated Homeless Robbers who are Happy and Wealthy. Good luck getting rid of them, no amount of taxes or lack of city services will deter them.  Police 			 	Well, the police are currently broken as they cannot ""arrest"" homeless robbers, and since there is no way to control patrolling or set up stationary ""standing"" locations for police vehicles, 3 police cars will drive around chasing 1000 criminals in a town of 500 people, causing the crime to kill the city. At least my police helicopter flies 10 feet south above my river on it's routine patrol, just to turn around and land. Also fun to watch my 3 police cars drive into a crime scene, look at the robber (or group of robbers as the AI just stand there) and then drive away without making an arrest. 		 Fire			  	A waste of money being ""on"" all the time as they don't help with traffic accidents or house-calls for EMS, or hospital, etc. Can just turn it on when a disaster strikes or a fire starts, but other than that it is super expensive to do very little. 			 Parks			  	No ""Parklife"" benefits, i.e parks built on sidewalks, etc. Also, no amusement parks, zoos, aquariums, etc. because, of course, they probably want money from a ""Parklife"" like DLC from CS1.  	No ""professional"" sports	 stadiums (which I believe was actually free from ""Sports Venue"" DLC)  	Trees are easier to plant, but can no longer ""clean"" polluted ground, and do very little, if anything, in stopping noise pollution.  Disaster			  	When an area floods, there is no way to remove the water without destroying buildings and using landscaping tools to ""push"" the water back. Cars will just drive through it, zoneable buildings will ""build"" underwater staying in a permanent destroyed state, and other buildings will just stop working unless you notice the water surrounding it.		  	Only tornadoes and forest fires (every 10 minutes or so, without fail), and no disaster routes or control of the shelters that are available, probably  because they want money from a ""Natural Disasters"" like DLC from CS1.	 			 Zones			  	No real district control, as there are laughable amount of polices (that do very little, imo).  	No historical buildings (no way to ""save"" a building model you like to preserve it)  	No hotels/motel/gas station manual control, even though it is purposely built into the Economy 2.0, again things that were basic in the ""After-Dark"" (Leisure and Tourist spec, etc.), ""Hotels & Retreats"" and ""Green Cities"" DLCs.	  	No ""industry zones"" which means no control of what ""companies"" move in, even though this is a big deal in Economy 2.0.  No way in vanilla to even see company info.  	No standalone warehouses or industry/company specific warehouse control to pick from, again because ""Industries"" DLC	made this available in CS1, another paid DLC.  	Zoning ""too much"" will create broken empty buildings, common in industry creating ""warehouse"" UI models, but no company will ever move in, or houses that remain empty even though homeless people are looking to move into a house (or college kids moving out of their parent's house live in a park or become a zombie instead of moving into one of these buildings), or you will get 5 of the same company in a row (or 5 gas stations, albeit different companies) in a row, or very close to each other."
178543649,english,0,949230,"I wanted to like CS2, but I can’t recommend it. The base game is boring, and you need mods to make it interesting and to fix basic glitches. Unfortunately, that led to my first-ever malware after 28 years of PC gaming, all because CS2 lacks basic protections—like two-factor authentication for mod uploads. Thankfully, the malware seems to only target crypto, which I stay away from, but that risk is too big to ignore. I am done with this game, and don't know if I will be back."
165142706,english,0,949230,"I have been waiting for some update to past before writing a review for C:S2.  If you want a city builder and nothing more, go for the original; If you want to build your own city with style, go for the original with dlc; If you want realistic simulation, go for the original with mods until your cpu is cooked; If you want to use the game as a sand box and go for pure beauty, go for the original with asset until your gpu is cooked; If you want to use mod and asset, go for the original which has !!

161134221,english,0,949230,"Half a year has passed since the game's release.  I've been patiently hoping Colossal would fix their game, and didn't request a refund when I had the chance. That was a mistake. Several months in, they still haven't fixed glaring optimization issues, or their simulation engine. Opening the game to see 20 fps in the main menu or on an entirely empty map on 3080ti was a very special experience.  Since then, in response to well-deserved constructive criticism regarding the game, the developer just showed their belligerence and tried to wrap it as ""playerbase's toxicity"" instead of fixing their barely functioning game, or coming up with excuses in line with ""if you want better performance our game might not be for you"".  Stay away from this game, it was released in an alpha state and has not been fixed ever since. Instead, their resources went towards paid DLC content."
158262106,english,0,949230,"I’ve liked playing Cities: Skylines 2 so far. It’s definitely an enjoyable game, with a lot of promise. That being said, the game does not get any points for being “enjoyable” and having promise. The bar was much, much higher for this game  While it’s not fair to expect CS2 to be as feature rich and polished as CS1 is, so close to launch - it is fair to expect it to be fully functional to the extend we were promised from marketing.  I can forgive the lack of assets. I can forgive the bugs. I can forgive that we were told that the game would initially launch without mod support and that mods would no longer be run through the Steam workshop.   But more than 3 months after release, Colossal Order has not been able to deliver timely updates to fix numerous bugs, let alone deliver features that they promised. Mod support and console release keeps getting delayed. Performance has been getting better but it is still an incredibly demanding game for what it is.   In 2023 and now 2024, the sad reality which I’ve come to accept, is that games will be released with bugs - lots of bugs. What is completely inexcusable is that they are no longer pushing updates for bug fixes/patches independently from DLC launches. Major patches will now be released alongside paid content.   In 2 years I’m sure this game will be better.  But CO deserves a negative review until then; this game should be marked as early access and its price should reflect that. Do not buy this game until then. You’ll have a better experience buying CS1 + DLC and modding it to your liking."
154112824,english,0,949230,"The potential is there but this game is in beta at best. I put hundreds of hours into the original CS and this game is awful in comparison. After 70 hours of trying to pull off builds, everything is bugged, nothing works as it should, and there's just no fun to be had.   Not only are we paying to beta test this for you, you're releasing DLC instead of fixing this buggy mess? Shame on you for the scammy product, shame on me for buying the ultimate edition.  I wrote the above review in December 2023. It is now 2025 and the game still feels like a buggy beta but it is almost playable. I guess I'll check in in another year."
173953297,english,0,949230,"so after  over 400 hours, and 50 hours since last update, i'm furious with this game. i've never seen so many different unrelated glitches in one game. i never leave reviews, but i had to get this off my chest. the longer you play on the same map, the more glitches appear, which is so frustrating, i spend hours and hours working on one single city, and by the time i get to a population of 100k, the entire city is so broken it becomes unplayable. things that were working fine when i started a map, start breaking, the land itself starts glitching, a wall of dirt will appear around your city, the buildings wont level up. the ocean level will magically jump 10 feet, flooding anything close to the water. when i say its a broken game i mean its broken."
158923154,english,0,949230,"Over 500 hours I've played this game and I'm done. Here's the gist:  [list] [*] [b]The amount of assets is dismal.[/b] Every residential house looks the same and there's like three variants. Every other commercial building is a drab gas station. Every high-density office building looks like a 20-story, gray, concrete masonry column of sadness. So gloomy. So dull. [*] [b]The lack of assets creates a horribly bland experience.[/b] It's not enjoyable/realistic in a city of 100K population to have three different house models and 100 office buildings that look like identical gray Lego bricks. [*] [b]The game is unplayable over 100K population.[/b] Speaking of large cities, the gameplay and graphics come to a excruciating crawl once a city's population nears 100K. 5800X3D processor, 128 GB memory, and a 4080 card? Doesn't matter. Slo-mo everything. And that's with extensive ""performance enhancement tweaking"" of the settings. [*] [b]Industry doesn't matter.[/b] Importing too much convenience food? Well too bad because building more industry to produce it locally will only spawn another hundred stone mills so you'll have plenty of rocks being produced. Oh and deleting and respawning industry buildings does nothing except create more rock shops. Maybe after two hundred deletions you [i]may[/i] get a timber plant. [*] [b]What about industry taxes?[/b] Best to not mess with these. Going to 0% or even subsidizing industries to encourage production makes no difference. Also, random industries will create literally hundreds of millions in revenue or cause a deficit in the hundreds of millions unless the tax rate is set to 0%. [*] [b]Ok just import/export using cargo then.[/b] Not a chance in heck. Traffic gets so backed up at train/sea/air cargo stations that trucks despawn and nothing is picked up/delivered. Unless you build ten cargo stations across your city. [*] [b]But, just like in real life cargo stations will hoard local and outgoing mail, right?[/b] This doesn't happen in real life but in CS:2 it does. Once a cargo station of any type is built it will hoard all your city's mail rendering post offices useless as no mail trucks ever pickup mail from the cargo stations. [*] [b]Schools[/b] Elementaries are hugely comical in size. No one goes to high school. Everyone goes to college. [*] [b]Parks[/b] No one goes to parks except the homeless who setup camp there. And forget about building large, beautiful parks like in CS:1's Parks DLC because that was left out for some reason and we were given boring, generic parks. [*] [b]The road tools are nice.[/b] [/list]  3/10  Go back to CS:1  EDIT: I just can't quit you, C:S2"

156075470,english,0,949230,"To be upfront, I have only reviewed this game now due to their first press release of the year. I have complaints with the game  in general itself among other things, but the biggest thing I cannot excuse is how the devs repaid their loyal customers. CS1 was a near masterpiece and outside of good game development, the devs were loyal and friendly to their customers. CS was the only game I can think of for a long time where buying DLC, while costly at times, was hardly a second thought because it both added content and was repayment for how much respect we as customers had for them.  CS2 totally flatfaced most of us. I bought CS2 not too early after release and expected what something between what was written about it and what I saw in CS1. I quit playing 10 minutes in when my graphics were all over the place, didn't work half the time, and when they did I felt like they stepped down considerably from CS1. After a number of updates I played again after hearing it's better quality wise. My honest opinion on CS2 is it's not only unfinished in many areas, but in places the game has taken a one step forward, two steps back approach. Like special industrial zones changing and how they did was nice, but it felt off the mark in other places like with how unnatural the zones are and how not many people can even occupy that site as a job. And of course CS is a traffic heavy game, but CS2 traffic AI is beyond broken as even with perfect road design you will always see cars paralyzed by excessive yielding and cars wanting to turn into a turning lane so they can turn out of it at the next traffic light - and god help you if you don't yield to their wanton desires.  Overall there's a lot of stuff that should be in the game that isn't, stuff from the old game that should be (like what happened to designing intersections with stop signs?!) in the game, and buggy issues that have yet to be fixed. And with a game so close to modders, you'd think day one there'd be mod support. There are mods right now that could be here on Steam, that have fixed a lot of the issues mentioned, but aren't here because the devs have spent their time doing whatever it is.  At the end of the day I can at least move on and forgive knowing these devs since their track record with CS1 was great. But since CS2 the devs have seriously not only let down their fans but outright betrayed them. And now they've gone full out blame-game by accusing the fans - their loyal customers - of being toxic. They suggest just making honest critiques and making suggestions but then ban or delete anyone who makes them in the game's related forums for being toxic. I was originally waiting to see if they would fix more with the game before I left a review of any kind, but after seeing this latest toxicity accusation against us, I decided to join others who've left negative reviews in order to show the devs we don't appreciate being missled and gaslit about a game they should have had no issue releasing in the first place. I will only swap my recommendation if they apologize and fix the game seriously from now on. Until then I will continue to play since I have the game, but I will not buy anything else from this devs like DLC until they change their ways."
174951039,english,0,949230,"[b]I wouldn't say ""don't buy this game"": I just wish I hadn't bought it so that I could still enjoy CS1.[/b]  It's been a year since the turbulent release and except for resolved the critical bugs, the game is still not on-par compared to the first game's quality and content.  With regular crashes-to-desktops and game-simulation speed grinding down to a halt after 150K-200K population;   [b]there is no point in being creative[/b] (you're already unable to, since there isn't much content to suit your narrative yet) [b]there is no point in being expansive[/b] (because after some point, each simulation minute takes five minutes) [b]there is no point in discovering[/b] (because you cannot spend your skill points without an either-or question, it's never both unless you play with 'everything unlocked')  There [u]are[/u] improvements to the first game, such as mixed-zoning and road-building --which I'm also angry about because now I can't go back to the first game after getting used to the comfort of these newer mechanics.

177024877,english,0,949230,"One year later and the game is still missing integral features that were literally promised in the promotional material. The economy still doesn't actually function, meaning you will not see goods from your industries travel across your town; everything just teleports as needed.  Your finances make no sense because somehow you just get more money but cannot figure out where it is coming from, resulting in there being no way to fail. It's also great to see their CEO literally _lie_ about features of the game before release, and then _blame the customers_ when the reception to their half-baked pile of shit is poor.  This game is not only bad, it's literal consumer fraud. Colossal Order have burned to ashes whatever positive sentiment I once held for them."
149097733,english,0,949230,"REVIEW UPDATE: I am now at 85 hours. After learning the mechanics of how the simulations work, I will admit my original review is influenced by not fully understanding some mechanics. For instance, the constant low density residential demand.  Aside from bugs rendering whole chunks of the game broken, such as trade and garbage bugs, after 85 hours the biggest issues I have with this game are two-fold: 1. An extreme lack of content. Building (and farm) diversity is extremely lacking. I suspect content will be DLC'ed to hell, which I strongly oppose Paradox's DLC strategy of removing content to the bare bones and then selling it to players later.  2. Design decisions that just simply don't work, or don't make sense. For instance, pegging ""wealth"" to ""education level"". Wealth should be pegged to career instead. How off map city services function also doesn't really work. They work against the principle of building a healthy, functioning city. If you lack a service, it doesn't negatively impact your game, except that sims have a little less wealth as they pay for the off map service. But that's easily countered by cheaper taxes. Standard genre features like the RCI meter work differently to all previous city builders. Instead of showing what to build for a healthy city, CS2 RCI meter shows what the city wants (which most likely doesn't result in a healthy city). Design changes away from genre standards are fine, just make sure to include in game ways to let the player know what the change is from the genre standard.  Anyways, after 85 hours my final conclusion stands. I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2. Aside from performance and bugs, the game has very little content, and has design decisions that don't work, or don't make sense.  ---- ORIGINAL REVIEW: I tried to like CS2, I really did. I can ignore the performance issues and bugs, as these are things I see being fixed over the short term with some patches in optimisation. However, there are much bigger issues that you need to be aware of. The numerous simulations in the game have such foundational flaws in them, that I believe this game is the most fake city builder of them all.  This game is marketed as ""the most realistic city builder ever"", with multiple levels of simulation in the city, sims, economy, services, and traffic. Unfortunately, there are huge flaws in each are of the simulation.  After 20+ hours playing, aside from the known performance problems (which I've mitigated by running the game at lower gfx than I should be), these are the biggest issues I see:  - The economy is broken. Goods in your city aren't actually traded. Import/export don't actually do anything, so trucks deliver goods to your stores and train stations, ports, and airports, but the transportation networks never pick it up to deliver off map. Industry, commercial and residential don't use your produced goods. There is no cargo traffic in your city, because there is no simulation of producing goods, transporting them to your shops, and then sims buying those goods. It's all completely fake. Colossal Order have confirmed this on Paradox forums.  - The progression system is broken, just place a tourist trap and bulldoze it, repeat over and over. Level 20 without doing anything. Progression is not linked to population, just ""XP"" gained from placing stuff. Thing is, it doesn't remove the XP if you bulldoze straight away. As a result you can have a ""Flourishing Metropolis"" with 50 people. Each main step should have a population limit. IE: town 10k, city 50k, metropolis 100k or something.  - Most people don't actually go to work, kids don't go to school, people don't shop. You can track individual sims. When you follow them, they actually don't go to work. They will get in their cars, or walk to the tram or whatever, jump on, and then do a circuit back home. Or they'll arrive at work and get straight back onto transport again to come home. Kids do not leave the house. They will stay in their homes, not going to school. The whole rush hour thing is a joke. Basically, the sims simulation is..... fake. And this is the big ticket item that this game is sold on. A simulation of each individual sim, going about their world, doing what the do. Living, growing, prospering, dieing. All faked.  - The city only ever demands low density housing, never anything else. City of 50k, with very little office demand. Always, low density residential will be 100% demand. You can even buy 20 tiles, do a massive grid of low density residential, it'll all pop into existence and demand will still be 100%.  - You don't need to build any city services, it all comes in really cheaply from off map. It's cheaper to import all services, than to build the services yourself and pay for maintenance. The only exception seems to be power and water. You can export power and water for enormous profits.  - Maintenance and expansion is not balanced at all. For some buildings it's cheaper per unit to build a new one, and some are cheaper to just expand. For instance water pump: $10,000 to build 100,000 unit pump, and $7,000 to expand one an extra 50,000 units. Cheaper to make a new one there.  - The traffic AI is just absolutely stupid and retarded. I couldn't think the traffic AI could be worse than CS1, but they actually managed to do it. Cars will do u-turns in the middle of a highway. Cars will stop in the middle of the road, jump across 3 lanes causing a big traffic jam, just to reach a left-hand turn they go straight through instead. Opposing carriage turns (ie: right from left side drive, left from right side drive) will not wait till the approaching through traffic is clear. They will turn like it's the middle of Delhi and cause a huge accident or traffic jam.  - The economy is extremely frustrating. There are no small-town service buildings, so to cater for your citizen demands you need to build service buildings priced for cities much larger than what you have. This results in grinding your city's economy into the ground. The only way around this is to largely ignore city services until at least 25k population when your tax revenue is starting to be enough to pay for these demanded services. All the while the annoying bird, building icons, and radio announcements will continue harping on about all these citizen demands. On the flip side, electricity and water exports are priced so out of balance, that building a few extra coal power plants and water pumps, and exporting every single piece of it, will have you swimming in money.  - The whole off map servicing of your citizens is quite simply extremely flawed at it's foundations. When you utilise off map services, the price of those services do not adjust to cater for the simple economic principle of supply and demand. You can pump as much electricity to the off map as you can, and the game will continue to give you the same high price for each MWh. Same with importing off map services. Using off map fire services will remain the extremely cheap price no matter how many fires they have to come and put out.  - The garbage system is totally cactus. Your incinerators will go get garbage from off map to burn, rather than burning your own. Your landfill fills up, your buildings fill up, and stupidly off map garbage trucks come and get your rubbish. The only way to get around this is to build huge landfills, and once they are full just bulldoze it. Poof, all garbage gone. Since incinerators don't collect your garbage from landfills, as it's cheaper for them to drive off map and get it there, it's the only way to process landfill.  TL:DR - Optimisation issues aside, there are MAJOR flaws in each of the game's simulations. The entire game presents a facade, layered on top of fancy marketing speak. I think in reality, this game is the most fake city builder out of any of the top-tier city builders in the 30+ years I've been playing city builders. Ultimately, I do not see how Colossal Order/Paradox proceed from here."

183690450,english,0,949230,"Well, after almost 100 Hours, guess it's Review time...  First, I bought the Ultimate Edition when the game came out, over a year ago by now...in hindsight I shouldn't have done that. But as we all know, hindsight is 20/20…  The Release was awful, dare I say, one of the worst states a game came out I have every personally seen. This game should have NEVER been released in the form it was. I generally like Paradox, I played a lot of their games, some way too much. Same with Colossal, I have over 500 Hours in Cities Skylines 1, but the way this was released, to be frank, I should have refunded it.  Even though all this was bad, you could say terrible, at least Colossal Order communicated with the community, though to be clear, it doesn't change the fact that this should have never been sold as a full price game, because the initial release was more like an alpha test.  I checked every time there was an update and yes they did their best to update it as fast as possible, fixing bugs, improving performance. After 1 or 2 months or so it was playable, performance wise, but the economy was kind of broken.  After a while I lost interest in the game, without modding, the game was dead for me, a waste of €90.  I checked again when FINALLY modding came, Paradox's own ""Workshop"" came, Paradox Mods for CS2. But finding out that ""for now"" we will only have code mods, so no new Buildings made by the community to enhance the game to where CS1 was at that time, was a bummer. In hopes that that would come soon, I gave it a chance. But soon was not so soon...  I lost Interest again and didn't play the game for half a year. To this day, 25th, December 2024, we still don't have close to what came for CS1 over the years. Now one could say with the region packs there is something and I want to thank all the people involved in those for what they made. But why don't we have building mods the way we had them in CS1?  To be frank, I lost hope for this game, I wish this will become what CS1 became, but my gut feeling is that this game is more or less written off as a loss, never to be finished the way it was meant to be in the devs minds. I wish, and I want to be wrong about that. But my gut tells me otherwise    And that's why, for me, for now, I can't recommend buying this game. After over a Year, it is still in a State that feel horrible and I personally have to say, from now on I will be careful with buying Ultimate Editions of games from Paradox, before CS2 they had that trust, that many others lost already, with this they lost that. What a disappointment.   If any of the developers read this. I am sorry, but you probably know as much, if not better, that this should have never been released the way it was. I personally, as a customer, rather wait longer for a product and get a product that is in good shape, then getting what we got. To compare it with something. This release felt like I just bought a car, without Engine, with the promise that that will be delivered soon, and it was just not in stock. Without a steering Wheel and doors."
177184040,english,1,949230,"If you've never played a Cities game play CS1, then with DLC, then with mods first. Come to this if you're a fan of that and want a graphical update, economy, and gameplay change. However, despite this CS1 will always be better for a long time. That is solely because of the amount of time updates, DLC, and mods have flooded into the community. Each fix of CS2 is a step towards the right direction but it doesn't overshadow the fact that the launch was very disappointing. It should never be standard in the industry.   Performance and stability has improved since launch for me. Pretty playable and the essential mods from CS1 are here. It's also a very pretty game but CS2 is not without its flaws including some occasional crashes. Consistent updates will help but buyers beware. This game is a slow burn towards what it can become.  Overall I would say this is a cautiously positive 6/10"
190555071,english,0,949230,Love the fact i Spent over 100 dollars on a single video game to make sure i'd receive all post launch content. Just to be laughed at and asked to spend another 35 dollars not even a year an a half later. Deplorable greed is going to be the downfall of this glorified city painter. Id recommend just play SIM city. Im done supporting this trash company.
166501755,english,0,949230,"I have almost 1200 hours in CS1. I bought it the day it came out and played on and off religiously for almost 10 years. Yes, it was nearly the perfect city builder at launch and was only consistently made better by the modding community.  I was absolute overjoyed when I saw the release trailer for CS2, so much so I took a vacation day so I would be able to dedicate the entire day to playing it when it launched.  Leading up to launch day I ignored the early access reviews and kept telling myself its just nonsense. Launch day comes and I was heartbroken. Poorly optimized, no mod support, no map editor, almost no changes that were promised were working, and the game was nearly unplayable due to crashing and freezing. I still held off on giving a poor review.  8 months later I see that mod support and map editing are in beta, and that the game has been optimized better. I re-download the game and hop in and things look promising. Load into a new game and the moment i go to lay my first road the game crashes. Just completely disappears off my screen. Load back in, new map downloaded from the mod store and it loads in completely dark, no UI anywhere and I couldnt even exit the game because the escape key wouldnt open the menu.  Alt+F4 and uninstalled again. I have 1.1 hours in this game and about 45 minutes of that was browsing the mod store. I can't even being to explain how disappointed and saddened i am over this. I have less and less time to dedicate to gaming now that i am approaching my 40s and CS was ALWAYS the game i could hop into and know i could relax and enjoy. It seems i cant even lay a single road almost a year into launch for a game i paid full price for.  Shame on Colossal Order, i am so disappointed."
191009754,english,0,949230,"I've waited a long time to write this maybe because, while I don't have a full understanding how game development works, I do appreciate the time it takes to produce something like this. But I think I'm at the point where I'm done. I pre-purchased the base edition and ""played"" during launch week, if you want to call it that. I completely understood launch issues and even the fact, many weeks afterward, that they were rushed to get this game out. By this point, not much has changed. I have 2 main issues that I just can't get over.  1. I realize this an extreme personal preference but the idea that we cannot get more pre-made intersection and interchange assets, even if by community modders, kills a lot of enjoyment for me. Call it lack of creativity or intelligence, but I'd rather worry about the layout of the city and not trying to find ways to make a kindergarten level highway interchange for myself. Something the first game did wonderfully in my view.   2. This is much more general of a complaint that my first issue kinda ties into. I keep asking myself, ""What have I gained by playing Cities Skylines 2 instead of the first game?"" Some people would have to point this out to me because, with my play-style, I can't think of much. Defiantly not enough to warrant the money, time, and patience I've put into this game.  I have come to the conclusion that I am no longer going to put any more hope into this game. I feel I've waited long enough and with all respect to the devs, I will uninstall this one and just go back to the first one. Maybe even continue to buy DLC's for it. But I refuse to put anymore faith in a game that is, essentially, a worse quality version of it's previous game. I would honestly love a refund for this game. I would maybe even use the refund to put back into DLC's for the first Cities. But fat chance of that by now.   I want to make it clear that I've been on steam for close to 15 years and I've rarely....RARELY left a bad review. Even when a game was absolute garbage. I would just uninstall and chalk it up as a loss. But this is different. I vividly remember when the first Cities came out and it was a godsend. Sim City had gone so far downhill that I commented to my wife, ""This is what the new Sim City should have been!"" Unfortunately, it only took Cities one game cycle for it to fall into the same hole. One could ask, ""What happened?"" Or  worse off, ""What's happening,"" since it hasn't gotten much past the point of, ""At least it runs...kind of.""  Conclusion, and it saddens my heart to say it, but if you're considering buying this game...just don't. Not even on sale. Buy the first one and save yourself the trouble and actually have some fun."
176134262,english,0,949230,"Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game at the moment (3/10). After 200 hours of trying to enjoy it, I’ve been disappointed by the lack of honesty from the developers. This version of the game is, at best, in a beta stage and feels like an insult to the many fans of the first game. Numerous features are missing, and we all know why: they’ll be sold as DLC, just to squeeze more money out of us.  Update January 16: The free addition of Creator Packs brings renewed appeal to the game and enhances diversity in city creation. This is a step in the right direction, but there is still much to be done."
156564590,english,0,949230,"[b]Cities Skylines II[/b] was a very long-awaited sequel to the most famous [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/]Cities Skylines I[/url].  [h1]What went wrong?[/h1]  Turns out - [u]Everything[/u] Let's go over some simpler aspects of why this game failed at launch.  [olist] [*]Having multiple ""Editions"" of the base game. Now, of course, I am not saying that this is a bad thing. If one really wants to support his favorite developer - he can freely do so, by buying a higher ""Edition"" of a game. The problem came with the rewards - [b]At the time of writing this review, people that have ordered said ""Editions"", have NOT yet received their rewards.[/b] Whenever you offer your game for multiple prices, people have a set [u]expectation[/u] that you, as a developer, must match. This was not shown by Colossal Order whatsoever.  [*]The game was announced in the March, and released in [b]October[/b] of the same year. Of course, some game companies tend to work on sequels undercover, and announce them only after they deem it ""up to their standards"". [i]This was not the case for Cities Skylines II.[/i] At launch - it was [b]VERY, and I mean VERY[/b] ""optimised"". I am gaming on 64GB of RAM and a 3070 Alongside a Intel i7-10700k, which is a pretty solid build. Result? Average of about 20-30 FPS on Medium graphic settings on a settlement with about 15k people. To also add salt on to the wound - game would frequently crash. I am talking consistent crashes every 15-20 minutes.  [*]Not being able to receive backlash for a very bad release of the game. If you were like most, and were of course, not satisfied with the release of the game in such a state, you would try to go and say it on the forums, write reviews, and ask developers questions as to how the fuck it is possible to release this junk. What you receive? A mute. Maybe a temporary ban for the time being for ""Harassing"" the developers. Now, I understand we are human, and being human means making mistakes. BUT WHAT THE FUCK?! You release a very, [b]VERY[/b] underbaked game, and then you decide to call everyone who doesn't like this garbage as ""Harassers"" and ""Demoralisers"".  [*]Mods. Or - lack thereof. Recently read a post from OC. It's the 9th OC post, and inside, and I quote -  [quote=Colossal Order Ltd.]Public Beta version of code modding and Paradox Mods will be available in the live build by the end of March. Public Beta version of Map editing available in the live build together with code modding or soon after. Public Beta version of Asset editing to be announced, only after the technical issues are sorted can we roll out the tool.[/quote] ... So, let me get this straight. You release a half-baked game ... With no modding support ... Until a year later ...? And of course, people got mad. Rightfully so.  [*]Problems. Bugs. And many core features missing. Of course, of course! What did you expect?? A Paradox game having a good launch?! Phaha! Don't make me laugh, both of us know that this will persist, until Colossal Order will start making [b]DLC's[/b], which not only paywall the original core features, but also do the damned bug fixes. [/olist]  [h1]Final Review[/h1]  At the state the game is currently - I doubt it is worth your time. You could spend the time you have on something more useful, or a game that is more fun. If you [b]really[/b] enjoy city-builders, and want to do something in them, then you can buy this game.  My review? About [i]3.5 out of 10[/i]. If you want to buy it, wait for a sale.

188885073,english,0,949230,"After eagerly anticipating the sequel to one of my favorite city builders, Cities Skylines 2 has been nothing but a disappointment. I pre-ordered the maximum version, investing significantly in what I hoped would be an amazing follow-up, but my excitement quickly turned to frustration.  The gameplay and economy have been simplified to the point of being uninteresting. Where the original game offered depth and strategic challenge, the sequel presents shallow mechanics that fail to engage long-term players. Most frustrating is that the DLC strategy focuses entirely on cosmetic additions rather than expanding gameplay with meaningful functional elements.   Also game not received the Ukrainian language support, which feels like an oversight given the global nature of the player base.  Technical issues have plagued the game since launch, with numerous bugs remaining unfixed for over a year. The developers seem more interested in pushing out visual DLC than addressing these fundamental problems.  The final straw came when the game crashed during a save operation. Upon restarting, I discovered all my save files were corrupted and completely unrecoverable - dozens of hours of careful city planning and building completely erased in an instant. This level of instability is simply unacceptable for a full-priced game with paid DLC.  I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2 in its current state, especially to fans of the original. Wait for significant patches or deep discounts before considering this disappointing sequel."
178222959,english,0,949230,"Cities: Skylines II is a promising game that has made significant improvements since its launch. However, it still falls short of its predecessor and the lofty expectations set by its developers.  The recent security breach, where malicious code was uploaded through the mod system, is a major setback. This incident highlights a serious lack of oversight and raises concerns about the developers' competence.  Given these issues, I have decided to uninstall the game. It's unfortunate to see such a potentially great game tarnished by poor development choices and security lapses."
163583527,english,0,949230,"I loved CS 1. For those of us who are not artistically inclined it provided a perfect sandbox to design & create. Truly, if you could imagine it, you could create it. I have (almost) as much fun ""shopping"" for mods as running the simulation (yes, unlike CS 2, CS 1 tries to be a simulation). It was the most unique and satisfying computer game (with the possible exception of KSP) I ever experienced.  But it is time to face facts: CS 2 will NEVER be superior to CS 1. Why?  First, it is not a true attempt at a simulation. The idea that if you cant supply your denizens that magic, invisible Amazon trucks will simple deliver what is needed is just an example. I'm sure there are other examples, but I have better things to do than pick apart the obviously rushed and half-baked work the designers did. What's the challenge of making a city both functional and beautiful if the simulation doesn't care?  Second, this is an UGLY game. The muted colors, building designs, etc. are drab. The resource buildings (how farms and mines are laid) are downright hideous. No corn, wheat or barley fields laid out in a nice checkerboard like (with mods) you get in CS 1, but blobby patches with haphazard buildings strewn all over the place. Did these guys even bother to look at pictures of farms in Europe or the US?  Third: Modding. It should have been a red alarm bell when modding was closed off behind the companies own platform. There really is only one reason for it. They are going to monetize the shit out of this product, and any modders (who are truly the simulation's heroes: King Leno et. al., you are tops!) are going to be frozen out. ""Oh, you have created 12 different palm trees? Well forget it. We are going to give them 4....and make 'em pay."" This will not change. They well make sure that ANY asset mod better than what they want to push down your gullet never sees the light of day. You stick with this simulation, hold on to your wallet, it's going to be a bumpy ride.  The thing is, it all could have been so different. They could have easily put this thing together by bringing in the modders, paying for the IP they put in to the first game, intergrate it with better graphics and UI, leave it open on Steam to mod, and save all those content creators on You Tube who were either left twisting in the wind or shown to be shills for an inferior product.  Instead they chose the AAA studio path. Put out an unfinished mess to save Q3 earnings. Make it as bland and broadly appealing as possible to get the fish hook in as many mouths as they could, and monetize the shit out of it. The word tragedy comes to mind.  I don't write reviews often, and never negative ones. I'm not as CS hater. If you look at my review for CS 1 I practically gush.  But when you take a vibrant, engaging simulation, and a equally vibrant and engaging community supporting it, and destroy them, I have to call it out for what it is: An example of sloth, crassness, and greed.  There is an answer. They mat have played me for a sucker in buying the base game, but they will NEVER get a dime more from me. They will NEVER get me to trust Paradox enough to pre-order on of their products, thinking they they are some not like Bethesda, Ubi Soft, or any other AAA a-holes who would shame a con man. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.  If you want to change this behavior, just do the same. Just say NO. You deserve no empathy if you put your hand on the stovetop a second time and get burned."
174971013,english,1,949230,"Colossal Order please re watch your own promotion video from 5 years ago by Justin Roczniak/donoteat01 and listen to what he says. That's what a good city simulation needs to be able to do, on top of being a good looking city painter.     Its a start but still has some odd design. I think the worst part is somehow its more sterile and overly clean felling than the first game. Shame on Paradox for pushing this out the door long before it was ready. Making hardware requirements this high end was a fundamental misread of your audience. City builders are traditionally played on mid range systems and laptops and by people who often don't prioritize cutting edge first person shooter/ action game graphics."

Congrats.  Normaly i wouldnt write any comment on that and just carry on, but the rly annoying behavior of the CEO, since release, trying to set themselfs as victims here is unaccaptable.

186093265,english,0,949230,"So many issues. You better have a huge C:\ drive because this game, no matter where you install it, sends all mod folders and downloaded content there. And you can't change it. They decided to have their own workshop platform, despite the fact that Steam workshop was perfectly adequate - and so far, they've distributed actual malware to their players, held up mods for almost a year straight, the game has to refresh 4 times in the main menu and you have to restart it several times.  I'm currently in a dilemma where I can't even access the game at all, even when launching with mods disabled. Round of applause for Paradox and CO please. These complaints don't even scratch the surface, have a glance at other reviews to appreciate the scale of ineptitude. Maybe buy this in 5 years? When they've figured out the basics. Because at the moment, it is a horrible headache of a game."
149251690,english,0,949230,"Setting aside graphics performance at launch, which is terrible, Cities Skylines 2 is a deeply broken city simulation game.  To be more precise, it doesn't actually simulate a city in any meaningful way and it's barely a game.  The economy and various systems are all FAKE; smoke and mirrors to give you an illusion of control and choice. Don't build a garbage dump? Garbage will be automatically trucked out of your city on its own by magic. Fail to have commercial or industry? The city *just works*.  The ""much improved"" traffic AI they claimed would eliminate the first game's traffic problems? It just makes cars teleport to their destination if they're being too slow.  These are a just a few examples, but every single thing they claim is being simulated, isn't. It's all incredibly shallow and fake and falls apart with more than a surface inspection. In terms if city management, simulation and city designing, It is several steps backwards from the first Cities Skylines in every way.  It is completely unsatisfying to play."
150319952,english,0,949230,"""Thanks for the chats all, but I'm moving on. :) EDIT: (Nov 17) I've heard from Paradox support to the query I logged. They confirm I was banned for this post, where I said ""Publishing games as bare bones as possible (even removing content to plunder later, looking at you pre-release DLC that CS2 has), is customer abuse IMO."".  The Paradox support person went on to state: ""Frankly I would have issued a much sterner infraction than the minor ""trollish comments"" one you got for that!"" (I can provide a screenshot of the email to those interested).  My comment got me a one month ban. Proves my point. ------------------------------------------------------ ORIGINAL POST STARTS HERE: I love city building games. I mean the ones where you can build up massive modern metropolis's like in this game. I remember getting my hands on SimCity back in the old days, and instantly fell in love with it. I would lay down roads, zones, services for the city, and watch it grow at my hands. And I loved every single city builder that came along. The various SimCity versions (except 2013), Cities XL/XXL/all the versions, City Skylines, and Highrise City. SimCity 4 is definitely my most favourite of the city builders.  When I heard that Cities Skylines 2 was being made, I got pretty excited. But also, pretty worried. I was really excited, because a new game in my second favourite type of game was coming out. And the videos made it look really good! But I was worried. Worried because Paradox was publishing it.  When CS1 came out, it was an insta-buy for me. I really enjoyed the game. I was happily playing along, making cities, and then the DLC start coming out. Before CS1 came out, for years I had bought Paradox games and the DLC. However, I was really getting annoyed by the DLC policy of Paradox. CS1 came out on the heels of the 80th or something DLC for Crusader Kings 2. Not to mention the countless DLC for HOI and EU that I also played. So when the DLC starting coming out thick for CS1, I decided it was time to bow out of Paradox and put them on ""the list"". ""The list"" contains the publishers I will not buy games from. There's a few now, including EA for what they did to SimCity/Maxis. Paradox had joined them. I did not buy a single item from Paradox after June 2017. I wanted to, believe me. But this was my very minor protest against their DLC policy.  And then came Cities Skylines 2. I actually held my ground, until the day before release. I knew if I bought in, I'd be buying into the DLC flood. I was really conflicted. I knew Paradox was going to DLC the hell out of the game, and there was the performance announcement before hand but I knew from experience (with my work) that performance can (and usually does) get fixed. But I REALLY wanted to play a city builder. So I caved, and bought the standard edition. Hey, at least I would minimise my losses to $70 (AUD).  The day came, and I downloaded it, and started to play. After changing a few graphics settings, I was okay with sitting on medium graphics and tuning a few things like RPS suggested to. And I played.  But it wasn't too long before I started noticing things. But I kept playing. I noticed even more things, and read about similar things others were noticing on the Paradox forum and here. I got to 25 hours and wrote my review. I didn't want to give a cheap 2 hours review, so I gave the game an honest shot. I was actually really shocked how popular my review became. I just wrote what I honestly saw in the game.  Then the hostility began. I found myself banned for 3 days at Paradox forums for the most flimsy of reasons (the review was being discussed there and I commented on that thread). At around the same time, I started getting threats and hostile posts on my steam profile, my workshop items for other games, and ended up playing whack-a-mole deletion of posts. No point reporting as they were level 0 empty profiles just made to attack me. But I did keep playing, because maybe they had a point. Maybe I'd misunderstood some things.  Anyways, eventually I hit 85 hours. I was done. I did an update to my review, and my 3 points that I feel kill the game for me stand. They are: 1. Performance and bugs. Whilst performance had improved on the graphics side, over 250k pop my PC would start suffering from repeated stuttering. This was simulation, not graphical. The list of bugs is massive. Just look at the confirmed list on Paradox forums. 2. Lack of content. The extreme lack of content is really disappointing. Obvious hat tip to DLCing us to hell. Yeah, there's a content creator pack of some couple thousand assets coming for free, but I would put a hundy on it that the original point of that pack was to introduce paid-for curated special content on Paradox mods. But they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants and giving it for free now. 3. Design choices. There are lots of design choices that just simply don't make sense.  It was at this time that I posted a new thread on Paradox forums outlining the above, and that I was putting the game down for now. Shortly after that thread was posted, I found myself banned for a full month. I have read carefully the code of conduct, the infraction matrix, and also the support page on forum user rules. I cannot see anything I could have legitimately been banned for. I can only think it was because I have been vocal in honest criticism (it's not the only time Paradox has been caught censoring their forums of negative feedback). Their code of conduct and support page also give you some instructions when banned. Contact the moderator in the instance, or if you cannot contact that moderator, email admin@paradoxinteractive. The irony is, when you are banned, you cannot access the messaging system to read the notice why you got banned. Nor can you reply to it. So I've tried emailing (politely) the email address a couple of times. I've had no reply. I don't believe I will get a response either.  So at this point, I am done. I feel that my feedback is not wanted, nor do they want to hear it. I believe that Paradox doesn't want me around, and I will just continuously be banned at Paradox forums, and if I continue to post here, banned here as well. I actually don't think this post will last long, but hey, let's give it a try. I'll screenshot it and post it to my steam profile. Avanya can't get to me there. Hahaha.  I will never, ever, buy another Paradox product. My experience with Paradox in the past, and especially recently, is that they are a hostile, abusive company that will stop at nothing to suppress honest critical feedback that they believe may impact their shareholder profits. My belief that Paradox is an extremely toxic company has been reinforced with my recent interactions with this company. I will never engage with Paradox forums again. I will never engage with any of their product, or the products of any company that has an association with Paradox. I am completely done with this company.  To everyone I've chatted with here, go in peace and have some fun. Thank you, all of you, for the fun times I had here. Even you Stealthy, even though I still think you're a Paradox employee here to muffle out any negative comments. You never did answer my question, but it's okay, you're off the hook now.   My review: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998739866/recommended/949230 Paradox thread I got one month ban for: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/its-time-to-put-cs2-down.1608679/""  This is the state of CO and paradox as a entirety, this one persons feelings has everything I have to feel about Paradox.

177621498,english,1,949230,"This game still lacks a lot of of basic things and feels unfinished. But I have to admit, I haven't played CS1 since I got this game. Overall, I like it."
185833970,english,0,949230,"I have never been so conflicted.  I have re-downloaded CS2 about 5 times now, compelled by the overwhelming amount of beautiful showcases of CS2 cities on r/CitiesSkylines. Every time I have re-download CS2, I am immediately reminded why I uninstalled it. I want to like this game, I love the realism of the graphics, the animations of the sims, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and of course the option to make an intersection into a round-a-bout.  Unfortunately despite all of these new features CS2 compares nothing to CS1, I must admit, I do play with all the CS1 add-ons and was extremely disappointed when I first played CS2 to see I could no longer make my own custom university, airport, or park. Even despite all the additional content of CS1, it still prevails as the better game. If not for it's lack of bugs and glitches, then be for the lack of malware issues.  Never before have I wanted, nor even considered writing a review about a game, not even my favourite games, not even the masterpiece that is CS1, but the existence of CS2 conflicts me. I want to like the game, I want to play the game, I want to enjoy the game, but yet I don't. As the sequel to CS1, CS2 looks amazing, and it's features and game play pull me away from CS1, but its bugs, glitches, and, lack of customisation push me into a weird spot where I can't bring myself to play either game, a feeling so weird, it compelled me to write my first and probably only review."
149758101,english,1,949230,"I'm gonna try to be genuinely honest here. The situation for the game is pretty nuanced, and that can be difficult to express in a time when everything needs to be a meme and/or the worst/best thing to ever happen. In short: you can buy the game right now and have a heck of a lot of fun, but the game might have gotten off to a better initial reception had it been delayed for another 6 months or so.  Pros: The game is a lot of fun at this stage, and I am so happy we already get to play it whenever we want.  1. What is here now is definitely enough to call this a ""full release.""  2. You can do a LOT, and you have much better tools out the gate compared to the first game. It's less finicky, while also more powerful, so it's a heck of a lot easier to reach a higher baseline of cool-looking cities. Can't overstate how much of an evolution this is. Examples: road tool is insane, zoning (and the way assets are categorized) gives you much more control, as well as more types of zoning.  3. Performance issues aside, the game is an insane visual upgrade. The game can look frankly shockingly impressive. This ties into the first point to make cities better-looking by default. In the first, you'd need several mods to start making cool cities. Not here.   4. The simulation is really hecking cool. There are some bugs, but in general the way the city works with individually simulated agents makes for a city that has sort of its own life independent of your decisions - all of a sudden, you might notice a lot of people have educated themselves and consequently want different places to work and live so you now have a bunch of other options to build different stuff. Cool! So, it needs a little bit of work, but it's absolutely mostly there.  5. Since everything is simulated, traffic is a lot better. Mostly, you're fine, and at rush hour you get some backup. That's pretty much it now.   Cons: there are pretty good arguments it could have been a) delayed for like 6 months or b) released as an Early Access product.  1. Quite a lot of small bugs. Whether it's education being unbalanced, commercial having weird import/export stuff, or garbage being handled oddly, there's stuff in the simulation that isn't working as intended, or is in need of further balancing. Most of the stuff is simply down to not having played the game enough before to notice, or not having enough time to fix it. I guess it's annoying if you sit and think about it, but not a single one of the bugs have really bothered me in a meaningful way.  2. Performance is bad, but Colossal Order have been very upfront about that from before the game was released. Some of the reporting on it post-release, however, makes it seem like they just didn't have enough time to finish all the work. For instance, the reports on wild amounts of polygons being rendered, the acknowledge (more-or-less) by Colossal Order about LOD work simply not being finished, or the broken effects (you pretty much need to turn some of them off.) You can ABSOLUTELY run the game - just check out the posted performance guides on which effects to turn off.   3. Compared to a very kitted up Cities Skylines 1, with all DLC and mods, you might feel a little restricted. If you've played it a lot you'll come across situations where you go ""what a great spot this would be for a custom park,"" or whatever feature from the first game's 10-year life cycle. If you've never played that version of the first game, you might come across situations where you're like ""so I just build more of mostly the same type of district?"" And...both yes and no. There is some challenge to be creative, but on the other hand that forces you to familiarize yourself with the tools at hand to get the most creativity out of what IS here. Your mileage may vary.  4. Bluntly, some things just make it seem like the game is like 3/4 finished. Why are there no unlocks past the half-way point of the development roadmap (small city-big city etc)? Room for future expansions, or planned but cut features? Who knows. Don't get me wrong, these are non-essential things, but the feeling is there after almost 70 hours in the game.  Taken as it is, you could argue they should've delayed 6 months or released into Early Access instead. But you can also argue that releasing it will ultimately make the game much better much faster by both a) making the developers accountable to the players rather than some arbitrary release date and b) giving them more feedback than they could ever need to improve the game. Is it a little cynical? Maybe. Did they coldly calculate that the short-term reputation loss would be offset by the longer-term improvements of both what the bottom line looks like for the fiscal quarter as well as the game itself? Also maybe, but don't they have a right to do that, and do we need to be maximally dramatic about it if that is what they decide to do? Looking at it coolly, it is a complicated situation for a company, and either way they would have gone there would have been pros and cons. I won't presume I'd know so perfectly well what would be the right thing to do for players, employees, publisher, and the company itself.  Furthermore, you could argue that the Early Access label brings with it certain connotations - a never-ending cycle of waiting for when the game is no longer ""almost finished"" and developers who just abuse the concept to avoid accountability or expectations of quality. Also, is it maybe not allowed to release something as Early Access, when it's already been marketed as a ""full release"" sort of thing? Heck if I know - I'm not a lawyer!  To sum it up: Issues notwithstanding, I'm super glad I'm playing the game now rather than in 6 months. I'm glad I get to play it in a state where I can expect what is there to be enough for a release, and don't have to think about what's a month or two down the line. As for the rest of it, I might feel a way about it, but ultimately I'll leave up to Colossal Order because it's their product in the end."
170579341,english,0,949230,"Ok, cards on the table, I was really excited to see the new release after so many years. But to our dismay, you have somehow ruined it in ways we did not expect.   Pros:  1. better graphics 2. cooler looking city services buildings  Cons: 1. Graphics have STEEP performance requirements.  2. A lot of terrain tools were removed.  3. even on a rig equiped with a ryzen 9 with the 3090 and over 64 gigs of ram, i lag down to 10 fps. 4. population 10,000 lag starts opposed to the 30,000 population that the old game allowed before lag started. 5. Chirper is replaced by radio that wont shut up. even when paused, i hear it. Dear devs, old chirper was annoying enough, but it astonishes me how you've found ways to make it worse. 6. Infrastructure buildings became MASSIVE. so massive in fact, that instead of adding public transport as a feature to your city, your city is a feature of your transit buildings.  7. you can no longer tell where a majority of your path-finding is going on. in the old game, i could tell where a lot of vehicles were trying to go, so i could optimize. here, its all guesswork. not fun. 8. no access to the steam workshop, however you did add your own store so that people who had their mods here, lost their traffic.  9. money. no matter what i do in this game, after SO long with the first one, i cannot for the life of me stay in the green. No amount of tutorials, even COPYING youtuber's ""successful"" cities. i always find myself needing to take out loans.  10. lack of road options. I want a 6 lane avenue with bike lanes and tram lanes for starters.  11. Bugs. i understand that games have bugs on early access, and really early years, but this is some Bethesda level stuff here.  12. you tried so hard to make a continuation of your game to make money, but you are driving away people because you provoke us to write reviews like THIS!   Fellow steam user, please give this game at least another year if not two before you buy."
177252074,english,0,949230,"As a huge fan of the first Cities: Skylines, which—despite becoming a classic Paradox DLC cash grab—still worked and worked well across the board, I had high hopes for the much-anticipated sequel. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Cities: Skylines 2.  The game is plagued by endless bugs that seem to multiply with every patch. Every ""fix"" only introduces more issues, leaving the game barely functional. The so-called ""Economy 2.0"" update? A joke. All it does is give you slightly less starting money, nothing more. The game has been out for almost a year, and we're still missing basic features like hotels. And when you ask about it on the forums, the developers respond with cheery emoticons, telling you to turn on developer mode and manually install them yourself.  Are you kidding me? You can't fix something this simple? Do you even realize that the only reason people didn’t refund your game in the first 20 minutes is because they trusted you? And what did you do? You slapped us in the face. Honestly, I feel like a clown for sticking with this mess for 184 hours, hoping you'd finally get your act together.  Screw you, Paradox. You've earned it."

Given your reputation and resources, it’s baffling that such issues persist. I expected better. This frustration makes me question whether game development is the right industry for you. Perhaps a career in something like insurance—less reliant on delivering a functional product—might be more fitting. At least then, people like me could avoid this level of disappointment. Please take this as feedback to improve, not just for this game but for future projects. Gamers deserve better.  Fuck you.  Sincerely, A truly dissatisfied customer"

I have a 13900k, 64gb of ram, and a RTX 4090, playing on a 1440p ultrawide monitor. I got 35 fps at the main menu and in game on a brand new map w/o building a single thing. Turning off motion blur and depth field increased this from 35 to 50 fps.  Not a single other graphics setting changed the performance at all. I turned off every single setting I could or set it to the lowest possible, and still only got 50 fps.  This is impressively bad optimization, I actually can't recall another game recently where changing the graphics settings literally did nothing to fps.  Just stay away from this until they fix it."
188024915,english,0,949230,"I hate the way that it lags, the way that it stutters, I hate the way that it plays  I hate the game, I always need to actually push myself just to start the game and then closed it after the pop up launcher showed up.  I was excited to jump into Cities: Skylines II after hours playing cities skyline 1 on steam and my PS4, expecting an improved city-building experience, the ability to build off service buildings, the seasons, and better option at building road (overall yes, more mechanism than CS 1)  what I got was a game that runs like a broken-down Porsche Mauser tank.  Let’s address the elephant in the room: Cities: Skylines II is horribly optimized. The fact that they list an RTX 3080 as the recommended GPU is ridiculous, frame rates are inconsistent, stuttering is constant, and performance tanks as your city grows. It’s frustrating when a game that should be about creativity and smooth management ends up feeling like an endurance test for your PC/laptop.  I was never asking for ultra-realistic, almost dull graphics. The original Cities: Skylines had a clean, semi-stylized look that made cities feel vibrant and inviting. Cities: Skylines II, on the other hand, leans too hard into realism, making everything look too muted and uninspiring. The lighting feels off, textures look muddy despite the “improvements,” and overall, it lacks the charm of the first game.  hard to enjoy when it runs so poorly, I really like CS1 the way the semi-stylized look....even though the animations were simpler, they had a certain charm that made the city feel alive. I like to see a dog turns into a car, I like to see thousand of people summoning their own car or bike after leaving stadium with angry after their team losing. It kills the immersion rather than enhancing it.   I find myself wanting to go back to Cities: Skylines 1, that's still something that CS 2 can't replicate even after 1 year, 3 months, and 23 days after release."

I put over a hundred hours in it, and I regret that. The bones of the base game are better than CS1, but it just needs more time in the oven and more features in the base game.  I also really resent that Paradox saw fit to release it when they did. It's emblematic of a company that doesn't respect its customers and willfully ignores what its devs are likely telling management."
172636255,english,0,949230,"I bought this game shortly after launch. Despite its initial flaws, I held out hope that the devs would provide patch updates that fixed the issues with game play. Now, despite months since launch and several patches released, the game remains virtually unplayable. Patches meant to fix the game bring about other, larger issues somehow, and it remains painfully obvious that the developers had no business releasing this game when they did. Cities: Skylines 1 became popular in no small part due to the flawed release of another city simulator, and they apparently learned nothing from that situation. I cannot recommend this game."

150199704,english,1,949230,"A potentially great game which is hampered by issues with simulation, glitches, and lack of key features that should have been available from day 1. I still recommend the game, as there is no mixed/middle ground option, as long as one is aware of the game's shortcomings.  GAMEPLAY: Most features from base CS1 are back, together with a mixture of the old DLC content, and even mods, and some new great features of its own. There is a ton of content available, and this is where the game shines.  Building things is much more pleasant in this game than in CS1. No forced roadside requirement. Roads and tracks can intersect multiple other roads/tracks. Upgrading and adjusting roads is much easier. Electricity and water are automatically transported via roads. Adjusting intersections a la TM:PE is a breeze. Roads and tracks can be freely connected to city neighbors. Out of bounds intercity lines are now at the player's discretion.  Buildings can be upgraded via modules, a nice addition and one that quite likely allow for quite a bit of customization later on when mods are allowed - i.e. expandable train stations. Building scale is overall improved relative to the first game, though airports are still horribly undersized.  Maps are bigger, though like in CS1 only a fraction of it is available to the player without mods, and even then there are limits on the number of tiles you can buy. This is a drawback in my opinion, and at the very least the available area that can be bought should be fully available, if not the rest of the map.  SIMULATION: A mixed bag for me. In one hand, traffic is more random and when it works is more pleasant to watch in my opinion. There are nice new touches like seasons - though more control over them is desired - and traffic accidents.   In the other hand, the simulation is very slow, and things take long to progress, even at the fastest simulation speeds. Furthermore, AI vehicles leave a lot to be desired in many circumstances, for example, near highway ramps where they tend to all try to merge into the highway instead of exiting, at the very last second, causing huge backups along the way.  Another key issue for is the separation of residential demand into low/medium/high density. As a sandbox game, the choice of density should be left at player's discretion, especially when commercial and office buildings are not affected by this. In the current state that the game is, there is way too much low residential demand that never seems to end, forcing one to build swaths of suburbia, even if some or all can be replaced at later stages in the game.  GRAPHICS: I quite like the direction of where the game is visually going. However, the execution is poor in that visuals are quite ""grainy"" and pixelated, and can look downright horrible at certain angles and distances, even on the highest graphical settings with a good GPU.  SOUND: The radio with a mix of generic relaxing music intersped with newcasts and talkshows discussing minutiae in and of your city is back. Music is ok but bland, and overall rather limited in which it becomes repetitive pretty quickly. Personally I listen to something else in the background instead.  OTHER ISSUES: At the moment there is no official modding support, or a map editor included, and there is not a big variety of maps to begin with in the base game - only a dozen or so. There are already mods being developed and released in third-party platforms, however.  Furthermore, even when modding support does come in 2024, it will be limited to the Paradox servers, and there will be no Steam Workshop support.  Also, the game may suffer from occasional to frequent crashes to the desktop, so make sure to enable autosave, which comes disabled by default and is a source of grief to many people in the forums. Or at least save manually often.  SUMMARY: Cities Skylines 2 is a game that has a lot of potential but suffers from a rushed release. Updates will likely rectify many of the issues and the review will be re-edited accordingly. In the state that the game is now, and its price, I think is a decent game, and one that is quite entertaining if it runs right, but nowhere near its potential. 6/10  Dec 1st 2023 edit: reduced my rating from 7 to 6, due to finding out no official Steam Workshop, too frequent crashes at times, and quickly dwindling performance in very large cities."

Simulation isn't what it used to be in Cities Skylines 1. 4. No steam workshop. Why not? 5. Tons of features in CS 1 that were cut out of CS 2. Too many to name.

192329091,english,0,949230,"As someone who loved the original Cities: Skylines, I came into Cities: Skylines 2 with high hopes. The first game had tons of content, and the Steam Workshop support made it even better. Unfortunately, this isn’t a review of the first game — and that’s where my disappointment starts.  Cities: Skylines 2 improves on a lot of systems from the original. There are some great quality-of-life changes that make city-building smoother and more modern. But even with those improvements, the overall experience feels lacking.  I pre-ordered the game and received 15 DLCs (I believe) as part of the bonus, but most of them are just building reskins or region-specific buildings that don’t add any real gameplay. It’s hard not to compare that to the DLCs for the first game, or the workshop where I could find similar — or better — content for free. What’s worse, the two DLCs I did buy for the first game (which added meaningful content) are completely missing in the sequel.  It’s hard not to feel like Cities: Skylines 2 was rushed out and monetized aggressively. Despite being out for a while, it still lacks the depth and charm of its predecessor. On top of that, I experience random frame drops and lag, even though my PC should be more than capable of handling the game.  Right now, I can’t recommend Cities: Skylines 2. If you’re deciding between the two, the first game still offers a better experience overall — even today. That said, I’ll be checking back periodically to see how it evolves. If things improve significantly, I’ll happily update this review."
186238355,english,0,949230,I have a love hate for this game. I love the mixed zones and all the great features we had to use mods to get in the first game.   However this game crashes all the time.

The constant crashes and that one setting alone makes me not want to play anymore.  I'll come back in a year or two when they've got their act together.

149026228,english,0,949230,"Updated on Aug 29: The game is still in a bad shape, almost all the problems are still present, while the last patch was almost 2 months ago. There's still not much on the Paradox workshop due to the ban on external resources. Very sad.  Update on Apr 12: They could've just used the Steam workshop... Reinventing the wheel hardly end up well.  Update on March 11: It's been 5 months since the release and the mod support is still ""in the works"". I cannot emphasize enough how badly CO played their cards and all that expectation, hype, momentum, whatever has definitely died down. GJ CO and maybe I should check back in a year from now??  Update on Nov 1: - Radio is kinda boring and there's limited track list. Even worse the hosts give you straight up false info (power outage, no more water, etc). - Same thing with the Chirpy - Again, traffic AI is dumb! Sometimes they straight up ignore your signage, sometimes they just do the weirdest thing on the road blocking the entire street. Case in point: [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17l6sfu/radio_traffic_sucks_today_meanwhile_cims_hold_my/]see this[/url]   Update on Oct 29:  I have a 6950XT and 12900K, my profile has not updated to reflect this. Sorry if that confused you!  - If you are like me who hated the new white reflection/torn effect on the roads, do the following -- enable developer mode by adding ""--developerMode"" to your launch options -- load up a game and press Tab -- on GameRending > Shaders, disable BH/Decals/CurvedDecalDeterioration (credit to REV0 for this)  - The performance problem seems to be subsided after experimenting with the graphics settings. I have now ~40fps now, but it's only a 20k pop town so will see how things scales. Random stuttering still occurs.  - Traffic AI is actually kinda bad and borderline funny. Erratic lane merging, getting stuck on a roundabout, or 5-point U-turn on a street was often observed.  - I studied some issues in the game economy and the solutions are... uh.... quite not what I expected. For example for the ""Not Enough Customers"" issue, it was advised to tear down its neighboring business(es) until you roll into a biz that happened to use what that shop is selling. For example you can have a Food company with not enough customers, and you should keep demolishing its neighbors till you get a Restaurant company that turns Food into Meal. Problem solved. Or is it???  - Likewise ""Rent Too High"" issue is because my citizens are lacking education etc. to find a job to afford the rent. Despite I have a number of schools all the way from elementary to college. I built buses to facilitate transit. Nope still not enough people literally are broke they can't even afford ""Low Rent Housing"". Guess the game is telling me I need UBI in the city?  And before you asked, yes the game does feel like an upgrade from the first iteration with many much needed changes and QoL improvements. However I do have high expectations from the CO and I hope these issues are rectified before I can wholeheartedly recommend the game.  Do I like the game? Yes but only because I loved CSL 1. Do I recommend it at this stage to anyone? No.   ================================= I really, really, really wanted to like it - but the game could use much needed improvements right now.   Issues includes the following: 1. Performance. The latest 1.0.11 patch did enable ~80fps in the main menu, but in game it's still around 20-30fps. Worse still the game now is stuttering very bad when I pan the camera, which didn't happen with the original release. This made the game literally unplayable for me post update.  2. Tutorial could be made better and more accessible. As of now it doesn't cover basics well enough, and as a CSL1 player I got confused with some aspects still.   3. Rent too high? Not enough customers? Buildings getting abandoned? I have no clue how to solve them and the game isn't exactly telling me how to solve them either.  4. Bugs especially how terrain and buildings/roads interact can be funny.  5. Not mod ready still :((  I will come back and revise this review should anything improves."

168892554,english,1,949230,"Cities Skylines 2 has had a bit of a rocky start, and I believe it's due in part because of Paradox probably pushing to get CS2 out earlier than it ought to have, and CO being the victim of its success with CS1 that it's set expectation way into the stratosphere.  That being said, with the release of the Economy 2.0 and the now additional assets just released, I would say if you've been on the fence about getting CS2, then I think now is a good time to get into it.  CO have been working hard on getting optimising the performance. They have listened to the community and have retracted the beach property DLC and incorparated them into the main vanilla game instead. They have reworked the economy which is a welcome change and actually makes the game a challenge and fun to play. The newly released assets are fantastic additions that now allow me to build smaller communities, and cul-de-sacs!!  The game still has more promise. When CO release a working version of an asset editor, this game will explode with potential. There's already some fantastic modders and content creators who are able to make truly stunning cities.  If you're happy to mod your game, and are into high level detail, then I advise you check out Sully's youtube video on detailing Snowdonia. It is utterly breathtaking. This is what I wanted from CS2 and Im glad we have it.  I'm not one of these people who set unrealisticly high expectations. I knew full well that any base version of  second game will be a rough diamond. Much like CS1 was when it released. CS1.  Very much enjoy this game."
163329170,english,0,949230,"Logged in today to find content I'd previously paid for, gone. So... while I've been perfectly happy with CS:II up to this point, I am now contributing my negative review.  At this point the game doesn't even run reliably anymore. I start it. It crashes. With or without mods. So fucking dumb. The whole point of this sequel was to integrate some of the improvements CS1 saw in the user mods so that we had a more stable game base to play with.   That's not the case at all here. This is just a rebranding. It's barebones play that still relies on user mods to make it a functional game. Most of my recent time 'in game', is spent troubleshooting. At least the last 20 hours."
175366797,english,0,949230,"It was one of the few games I was really looking forward to and bought it day one. It was disapointing launch and I didn´t play it for awhile. but somehow playing it now after multiple patches and fixes it feels even worse then launch. Expenses seem unreasonably high, graphics look cartoonish and washed (streets and houses look flat and bland), industry makes no sense and there is a feeling that there is no life in the city, just random cars and people. There is a high demand for high residencial, but no demand for shops or factories? Makes no sense. You need to have car access to park? Why? Garbage piles up so fast in 10k population city. No bike roads, electric cars and busses have no impact, people complain about noise when living in downtown area. Game crashes frequently. FPS has improved over the updates, but still its nowhere near acceptable for a high end PC."
149650170,english,0,949230,"When they announced that the game would release with performance issues I was ready to refund it if the performance was truly bad enough. Gamestar magazine provided a savegame on release to test for performance in the late game. I tested the game using that savegame and found the performance to be good enough. After getting my own city to ~230k pop 50 hours into the game later, this still holds true.  There are so many things I love about this game. They really put a lot of love into the road building tools compared to CS1, I love how for example single lane highways connect into multi lane highways, or roads of different sizes connect into each other in general. I love how trams work. I love how footpaths work. I love the upgrade/feature system for customizing road sections. And we even got surface level subways in vanilla now! I love the detail that went into the economy. I love all the pretty little details you can spot when you zoom in. And I can clearly see that the devs had a lot of great ideas for this game and in a lot of places put a lot of love and effort into it.  However it is also clearly visible that in a lot of other places they didn't get to finish their work. Be that minor visual stuff like some kinds of parks or buildings not properly reacting to the weather and season like other things do. Missing animations for emergency vehicles. Or the fact that many of the systems are just completely bugged. Like the infinite garbage import that completly breaks your city in the late game. Or that they gave us so much to micromanage, but no way of getting any data, statistics or overlays for some of the things you could really deep dive in. Why can I not see the profitability of my individual public transport lines? Why can't I see wether or not my bus line is actually being used at night? Why can I not see how many vehicles I have in my depots vs how many are in use at a glance? Why is there no overlay to see where certain resources are used and produced? Why can I not manage import via cargo trains/planes/ships better? Why can I not see the origin and target location of cars/trucks/pedestrians on the map by simply clicking on the to get a better overview over where my traffic actually comes from? There are so many things that can be micromanaged but there is simply no data to base my decisions on other than clicking and tracking everything by hand. And in the end there is no real point in micromanaging everything in the first place, because the end game economy is basically just having infiinte money regardless of how much I manage my economy until it all falls apart because somehow the entire planet sends me their garbage for processing and my 10 incinerators, 6 recycling centers and 3 dumps are immediatly filled to the max, even when I have twice the amount of processing needed to process my own garbage and my entire city drowns in trash. I really tried to love this game and building up my first city really was a lot of fun. However I'm at a point where I see no point in further improving my city any more, because at any point the garbage problem or something else is gonna ruin it completly and all the improvements I could make don't really matter in the first place. And I see no point in creating another city, just to get to the same point.   When they announced the game would release with performance issues they didn't lie, but they forgot that the rest of the game isn't really finished either. And for a successor of the first game, it really needs the endless replayability, that just isn't there right now. It's not a bad game, but it is incomplete. This game would have needed another year of development or so, but sadly that just seems to be the industry standard now."
173755312,english,0,949230,"BACKSTORY I bought ""Cities: Skylines II"" knowing that the public's reception of the game has been largely negative since its release. I eventually decided to try it out for myself—to form my own opinion. The first game, ""Cities: Skylines,"" was great. I immediately fell in love with designing, building, and optimizing interchanges. After years of play well-supported by both the developer and an incredible modding community that furnished a robust Steam Workshop, the game began to show its age. Enabling a handful of specific mods became standard practice, and certain shortcomings that neither developer nor modder could overcome were revealed. This showed the community that there was room for a sequel of sorts, a second iteration of the game designed from the ground up with certain improvements and capabilities in mind.  Among the aforementioned mods were ""Move It,"" ""Network Anarchy,"" ""Precision Engineering,"" and ""Traffic Manager."" The tools and quality-of-life improvements these mods provided players in turn provided the developer a starting list of features the sequel should include.  MY EXPERIENCE To the developer's credit, many of these improvements made their way into ""Cities: Skylines II."" From a road-building perspective, the underlying code for how roads are managed seems to have received a nice rework and the game has some great new methods for constructing intersections and the like. Sadly, some of these features lack refinement. Some cause glitches while others simply don't behave quite how one might want. For example, connecting two roads *can* work out nicely, OR it can cause the steepest mountains (completely impervious to terraforming tools) to erupt from the median reaching for the heavens.  FINAL IMPRESSIONS All of this leaves the player passionately yearning for what is clearly possible, yet heartbroken seeing it left just out of reach. I think the game has great potential, but lacks polish. It feels unrefined and incomplete. I'm confident the playerbase will create mods to help, but the game will never reach its full potential without corrective action from the developer.  It is also worth noting that a newer, well-spec'd gaming laptop struggles at times to handle the game in its current state. I get the impression that the game is not optimized very well. For reference, I have been experiencing issues while running the game on an ""ROG Strix SCAR 16 (2023) G634"" (Product Name: G634JY-XS97) (SKU: 90NR0D91-M001B0).  Now, I, personally, am left with the decision between requesting a refund (before I sink too many hours into the game) and keeping the game (relying on the developer to fix it). Ultimately, I will likely keep the game in hopes that my purchase will help fund an effort to improve the game. However, if I was more strapped for cash, I would undoubtedly request a refund. At this time, I would recommend anyone tight on funds to abstain from purchasing this product."
175264664,english,0,949230,"I spent hours and i mean hours on a city nd detailed as much as i wanted just for when i saved it, it completely froze my whole computer, and when i refreshed my pc, the save file for my world just disappeared like it never existed. I dont think i spent so much time and effort onto a city before just to lose it all. I would recommend this game but dont take it serious as any bs could happen. I might not be able to get the motivation to play again after this."
172054722,english,1,949230,"Good city builder but good god this game is poorly optimized. Be prepared for lots of sudden FPS drops. The economy and detailing updates have made it worth playing, although I would recommend picking it up on sale."
176459748,english,1,949230,"Recently started playing again after barely playing since launch. This game has its problems, but its still fun to play. While it is missing some features that were present (and highly useful) in the first game, the new features from this game like mixed/medium zoning and the road building are very fun to play with. The graphics improvement is also noticeable if you have a good enough machine to take advantage of it. It still isn't perfect, but this game has come a long way since launch."
190898660,english,0,949230,"Can you please stop releasing new content and fix the game, this new patch has literally done nothing to improve gameplay/QOL. Its getting embarrasing now. Still not playable! Traffic is still Mayham, cars have no real life direction"
175839538,english,1,949230,"I guess putting in 130 hours might be a sign that I really enjoy it... and I do! It had a rocky start with quite a few bugs that needed to be ironed out, but now it's much more playable, especially since the 'high rent' bug has been fixed. I do wish there was an option to toggle off icons in general—maybe there’s a mod for that, though I prefer playing unmodded for now. There are definitely some features from the first game that I wish would make their way into this one, like toll roads, and it would be great if disasters were made even more disastrous.  I like that they’ve made this version more challenging compared to how it felt at launch. Initially, it felt too easy, and I advanced through all the milestones quickly. However, what I still don’t like—and maybe I’m just bad at it—is dealing with traffic. No matter what I try, I can't seem to fully eliminate it.  If you enjoyed the first one and are still on the fence, I think it's time to jump off and give this one a try."
148945025,english,1,949230,Yes there are some performance issues but the gameplay itself is really enjoyable and big upgrade from first generation game. Although bike lanes etc are missing at the moment.
162377447,english,0,949230,"I am sure that this has been repeated ad nauseam in the reviews for this game, but if it had not been for SimCity 2013's disastrous release, the degree of popularity that the Cities: Skylines franchise has attained would simply not exist. One would think that, nearly on that game's tenth anniversary, it might be in mind for executives when determining a release schedule for their game.  Why did Cities: Skylines 1 succeed where SimCity 2013 did not? Simply put, it was unlimited where SC2013 imposed limits. There are many examples of this that you have probably heard before: community content, map size, one-way roads, yada yada. Why is it, then, that some the very things that helped spur the popularity of CSL1 in the first place not the first priority in a full new release?   This is all stuff you've heard before. What I have not heard nearly enough people talking about is that this game seriously lacks charm compared to its predecessors. I admit this is quite subjective, but hear me out. Like it or not, the donut vans and obnoxious sirens of the first game are iconic and goofy, and felt like they gave the game a charming identity; an unrealistic identity, perhaps, but it had spirit. It also had outrageous ploppables, like the Hadron Collider, in case you wanted to embrace your unrealistic side. SimCity 2013, lest we forget, had quirky thought bubbles, a poorly-disguised advertisement for Progressive Insurance, the 100% Electric Nissan Leaf, the whole future expansion that changed literally every zone?? and, on a more sincere note, the most fitting music for a city builder that I've ever heard, ever. There's a reason why the SimCity 2013 music pack for CSL1 was popular (no shade intended, that is hard to follow up). What is the identity of this specific game? Spasm Electronics?  I will give credit where credit is due. The road system of this game is vastly improved over Cities: Skylines 1, as are the building and vehicle models. I prefer the zoning categorization in this game, as it is a major step up in realism. The North American style does feel pretty American (anyone remember Roads United and that whole fisaco?). Roundabout support is very nice. The tree growth and seasons are nice, and adds value to every tree you place down.   The developers of this game are good people and I believe that they wanted to make a good and fully fleshed out game. I believe strongly that they just needed more development time to create a proper sequel, or they needed to release this game in early access, like many others have already suggested. One day I hope to revisit this game once it is in a more playable state, but I am worried that it will never get there, for me."
174677705,english,1,949230,"It is already a very good game and has tons of potential. I think it already surpasses CS 1 and is getting many updates, which is great from the devs. Despite the terrible launch, it has recovered very well and is set for many great things in the future."
148873180,english,0,949230,"Tough One  Long time CS1 fan but CS2 leaves me feeling both impressed at how much the engine has come on and disappointed at how much has been lost.   Firstly kudos to CO for at least warning us that the game was un-optimised, but, looking around at recent history should have told CO that this was an opportunity (However annoyed it may have left fans) for them to delay this release by a few months more to get it into a fit state.   After 15 hours of playtime on the sequel I feel confident enough (With a city of 110k) to review the game fairly.   So firstly the pro's  + Game engine is much improved, buildings look better, animations are much better (For the most part)  + The sims feel much more alive, you see them travelling and periods such as rush hour are now accurately reflected as opposed to CS1 where roads would grind to a halt anytime of day, which leads on to... + The road layout tool is vastly improved, at first it may look like its a simplified version of what we had in CS1 but there are powerful tools underneath the initial views that allow you to control many more aspects of the road layout, the AI also uses roads in a much more common sense way. changing lanes and trying to avoid jams + European and North American options for the most part (Apart from low density habs) look sufficiently different, although things like trains and some lorries are not localised with big old american trains for cargo spoiling some of the immersion  + Development points is a win, replacing the standard unlocks as you grow your city you can now select particular buildings or service in the order you want to, it makes for different playthroughs and options each time and gives you more control over areas to focus on in city development, a major improvement over CS1 + Slightly stolen from the last Simcity but the ability to upgrade existing service buildings is a welcome addition, rather than having to plop 10 different small police stations across your city you can now typically get away with one or two and simply upgrade them with larger garages or improved services. The majority of the time its cheaper than buying a new building and increases the coverage area, which reminds me + The service coverage area for most service buildings is far more generous now, gone are the days of having to plan to build 3 elementary schools all within the same area of your city because of their laughable service coverage zone. Service buildings now cover significant parts of the map. I did the earlier to mid-game with the very first police and fire stations you unlocked until I got to a pop of around 25k, impossible in CS1 without the city resembling a Friday night out in Essex  Now the negatives - Its day 2 of release so mods will come but right now the game feels sparse, minimal buildings and options for many of the different types of service such as schools and police means once you've unlocked one or two lines of each services development section you've pretty much seen it all,  I'm really hoping those of us who invested heavily in DLC for CS1 aren't going to be stung by countless additional DLC that simply should be in the base game to start with. Its pretty weak currently and once you've unlocked most things there isn't a great deal to do beyond continuing to grow your city with the same buildings - The game should have released with the creation kit and mods good to go. If they can bung free copies to 'influencers' to try and butter us all up over the last few weeks they could have done the same for the actual valuable members of the CS community aka the modders. It would have left the launch feeling much less sparse. On the subject of modding, i'm not precious about steam workshop or their own version of it, I would have just liked to have seen mods here at the start to make up for the lack of content  - Pathing whilst vastly improved is still an issue later in city growth. get above 80k pop in a decent size city and regardless of improving your roads, the AI seems to have a fit and forget all of the smart stuff its been doing up to this point and rely on the same core roads and pathing as opposed to the countless other options I tried to put in place for them to use. Which reminds me...  - Public transport feels generally broken at the minute. In a city of 110k I have 1% using buses (Despite very generous spreading of stops across my city, 0% using trams, 1% using the subway and 0% using my passenger trains. Seems pretty pointless, very expensive and totally contributes to the snarling up of the road network. Definitely contributes to the end game making you feel like you are just constantly firefighting the road network than actually city planning and needs to be patched urgently - The UI is pretty awful, everything from setting bus lines to the size of menu screens and the lack of customisation around being able to move with the mouse all feels weak at the moment and less than what we had in CS1. Its frustrating when you are laying out a transport line and suddenly a menu pops on screen and deletes all of the progress you've been making laying out your line. - I'll talk about optimisation more generally below but stability wise I've had one crash (My rig details below) but most important point here, for some unknown reason autosave is switched off by default, which in a game like this where hours of work could be lost to a crash seems insane to me, make sure its the first option you switch on and to the devs I'd strongly urge you to have this switched to on by default.   Optimisation  Ok, the big one.  Firstly kudos to CO for admitting they had a problem, but that admittance should have led to them doing the right thing for their customers and delaying the release, but hey, we live in a shareholder driven world so needs must I guess.   Optimisation is extremely poor depending on your hardware choices, what this means looking at the steam hardware survey is that 99% of people will not have a game that feels next gen when they play. CO have themselves advised switching off a bunch of graphical options to get a decent framerate and whilst this isn't Call of Duty where frames = better, the standard in 2023 should be having the game run at a minimum of 60FPS for the VAST MAJORITY of users. This unfortunately won't be the case for many many people.   So, things to make your experience more stable (if less pretty)  - switch off depth of field - 10-20 FPS improvement - switch off Vsync - same sort of frame gain as depth of field - try flicking between borderless window and fullscreen, some are reporting frame gains of between 5-10 fps - run it in 1080p if you have to - can give you 20fps or more - switch off all of the volumetric options - 10-20 fps   All of the above is obviously dependent on your own hardware setup but on mine (I-9 12900k, RTX 3080 TI 12GB and 64GB DDR5 RAM i've been seeing a stable(ish) framerate of 68-85 fps with a pop of 110k running in 4k.   Your own experiences may vary and i'm not disagreeing that some folks with better hardware than me are having a worse time than I have and this simply reinforces the point that optimisation does seem to be all over the place at the minute.   In summary though, its not good enough, when people with £5k rigs are having to switch graphical options off for a game that isn't a FPS, then something is quite clearly badly wrong in how its been built and delivered to its users.   The hope of course is over the coming days and weeks the game will be patched. But that still isn't good enough for a £41 game that many folks have been pre-ordering and building up to for most of this year. Sure it would have been annoying to delay it by another month or two but it would have earned CO a significant bit of kudos and support from the community rather than the review bombing and open hostility we have now.   In summary then, its ok, but for those with weaker rigs, avoid for now and wait for patches to come. I'm pretty disappointed"

192079570,english,0,949230,"I give up. This hurts because I really enjoy playing this game (when it works properly) and I've owned it since its release. Since the beginning I've dealt with periods of desktop crashes, thank goodness for auto save. Then we'll chug along for a while without crashes. New update comes out, crashes return. Now I get some system log error every time I boot up the game. I've read forums, I've combed through steam, I've uninstalled and reinstalled 5 times now - it won't go away. Supposedly there's a fix but you have to comb through a folder of never ending files, download additional software to identify the failure and then reformat the file. Look, I just want to play the game. I shouldn't have to become a software engineer to play  a game I spent decent money on. I don't know what's going on over at Colossal Order or Paradox, but they need to get their heads out of where the sun doesn't shine. Both entities should be embarrassed.

148958095,english,0,949230,"a great many reviews so far, both positive and negative, seem to center around performance. while it's definitely true CO shit the bed a bit here, for most people these issues are fairly surmountable (if not still having enough annoying present issues like stuttering for those same users). so i feel compelled to counterbalance that by listing an assortment of the the much deeper shameful issues/annoyances in this sequel  - the improved traffic pathing would really be more appreciable if the ""lifepath"" of cims seemed to matter all that much. there are distinct periods of high (rush hour) and low utilization, but in terms of actual behaviors, cims interact illogically (park at location very briefly before leaving immediately), sparingly, or often not at all - i know this is a complete rewrite of the game compared to C:S1, but how exactly did water physics manage to regress *this* badly? relatedly, don't waste your money on a hydro dam, as it appears to be wholly non-functional for power at this point... - ...or *do* waste money on your hydro dam because it actually doesn't matter—the game economy is opaque at best and non-functional at worst. i'm not sure if people are correct in reporting a *complete absence* of logistics mechanics, but it seems like colossal order have so little confidence in this area of the game that businesses/industries can get by on an excess of goods being teleported/freely spawned in their inventories while also potentially suffering from a lack of customers and continue for an incredibly long time without ever going out of business. i've seen a couple people successfully export goods, but most people report their air/sea/train cargo connections never loading a single thing, while other people report businesses that have no outside road connection whatsoever still remaining in business, so something is seriously broken in all of this. (also good luck getting your commercial plots to ever level up with their ceaseless moaning for customers) - you will frequently struggle to maintain a surplus, probably due in no small part to economic silliness. for most people, they probably are overbuilding services, but it is regardless more difficult than it probably should be. not to worry, though: CO have effectively papered over this by giving you particularly sizable cash bonuses every time you level up in the progression system. unless you've been running a deficit with no profits and few milestones for a while, you're unlikely to ever end up in a penny-pinching situation. this was also true to a large extent in the original game, but that was more because the economy was *easy* rather than due to it being fudged - dealing aesthetically with lots/roads on terrain in C:S1 was never especially fun, yet here we have also managed to regress massively from ""ugly"" to ""looks like a geometry error even if it's not"". actually, building on terrain has gotten worse mechanically in general as well. twice as many slope errors (and twice as easily/sensitively), quays/bridges yelling ""it's in water"" at the drop of a hat for infrastructure *literally meant to be proximate to water*, even if you get a road right on terrain there's a good chance you get stuck with a disgusting retaining wall setup, etc. - C:S2 got us all excited for increased ability to build non-car-dependent cities, in contrast to the original... then what we get instead (besides small ped paths that work similar to the original) is a single type of ugly, wide(!) pedestrian street that pedestrians don't properly utilize (maybe due to aforementioned issues with their day-to-day behavior?), but *CARS* DO LOVE TO UTILIZE (Lmao), especially if you zone commercial along it (like one normally would do with pedestrian neighborhoods). a lot of those commercial lots will end up being gas stations, too. i almost can't be mad at this one because it's so whimsical - further frustrating your plans for a beautiful ~modern and sensible urbanist~ city plan is the fact that it is remarkably difficult to ever push your cims into utilizing the public transit you very considerately built for them. not impossible, but far more often than not you'll see marginal utilization on decent routes. also, remember how i mentioned ped pathways/streets? in your quest to wean off car dependence, you won't see a single bicycle on said pathways. maybe that's just me personally taking offense as a cyclist, but it's yet another inexplicable regression from the original game - roads are, as everybody have noted, MASSIVELY improved in almost every practical way, yet often beyond what a seasoned player might expect. snapping is, all at once, too weak and too strong (depending on context). zoning plots becomes a planner's nightmare as you'll draw out a grid that is composed of perfect 90 degree angles and still get misaligned plots between the roads - expecting all DLC functionality to be in this as sequel is not realistic, but—i'm gonna use this word yet again—the absolute regression here in campus areas, park areas, district zone specialization (besides industry), etc. is pretty gaping - on release of the original basegame, the hyped-up ""district/city policies"" system was a little underwhelming as far as what you could really do with it (and it was only after several DLC that the policies menu had any flesh on its bones). it looks like an absolute abundance compared to the 6 or 7 policies they've given us here lol - i've made peace with the decision to not use steam workshop in favor of (still-unreleased) Paradox Mods but that doesn't mean i don't still think it's stupid and as an imposition upon this game it's just another feeble gasp from the increasingly frail, wheezing body of paradox interactive ever since they went publicly-traded - other cosmetic gripes. there isn't even a tasteful fog to obscure how ugly the borders of the playable map are. all vegetation and any non-sea water (like rivers and lakes) suddenly, visibly do not exist beyond the playable boundary, as do roads—they couldn't even bother with something that kind of resembles a road going off into the distance. the really funny thing is, i've seen (on the Tampere map at least) that trees *can* still render beyond the playable area and some scatter into it for tree clusters on the borderlines. they were just too lazy to add any garnish to this area otherwise. which doesn't really make you want to make use of the nearby playable area lol - death by 1000 cuts. so much across both major and minor functionality is either practically inoperative, fairly broken, or at least a little broken/unbalanced/inconsistent, including: > postboxes don't really seem to work. the postal system does (i think). just not postboxes. there's a lot of issues in other systems that are flat-out silly just like this > road-naming and what the game considers a distinct road is all screwed up. i've had entire grid neighborhoods have 80% of said grid's roads considered one contiguous road. and if you build off a road, you never know how radically the game will shift what it considers to be part of the old road or a new road entirely. custom road names are not protected in this process and you will lose your custom names extremely easily. at this rate i'd rather just pretend road names don't exist anymore and hide them, but hiding labels is not an option (which it was in C:S1) > seasonal cycles cannot be disabled and you cannot simply go to a climate that does not have seasonal cycles, because all maps/map themes are in temperate northern hemispheric climates anyway. your winter wonderland will quickly become a snowy nightmare"

It becomes boring very fast. I was happy when it was released and could start seriously a real city without interruption and progress through the game slowly but surely.  I burnt out quickly. The game is boring. The game CEO is shitting on us and trolling us like we didn’t pay for this game. “If you don’t like the game, this isn’t for you” this is a major middle finger towards the community.

148820365,english,0,949230,"Sadly this review is negative.   The performance is just unacceptable, there are some rendering issues plaguing the game, and on top of that there are some wildly unoptimized assets in this game.  From small guard shacks with modeled out wires, computers and keyboards to the horrendous looking procedural generated citizens that far exceed even some larger buildings in triangle count, they are a waste of computer resources.  The whole unecessary addition of a ''citizen lifepath'' is something very few players asked for, and its clear part of the issues with this game relate to choises made during development of the game.   The truth is, these citizen models look so hideous that they dont even invite you to engage with the lifepath mechanic at all, id rather have they were significantly reduced in detail, or replaced by assets modeled by an actual artist, and not a procgen program, before i would consider paying attention to the ''lifepath'' stuff this game offers.  I wanted to love this game, and in a way i still do, everything else Cities Skylines 1 did is improved in 2, but the terrible performance, and questionable looking assets really ruin the hype for me.   Also, this game has a launcher, and just like the 1st game, its totally unnecessary and offers no utility whatsoever, beyond serving advertisements to you for Nvidia.  This review might change to positive if the optimisation is adressed in the future, and the ability to mod the horrendous looking potatoheads is added..... Before then, if you are not brand loyalist like me, stick to the first game a while longer, this game needs a couple more months in the oven.  Edit: Further thoughts:  After longer play A noticeable issue is that Residential zoning demand is based on *density* not on *affordability*  Wealth does not factor much in where a citizen will move in as much as density type does.  This results in the player having to build an insane amount of low density zoning, even though denser apartment building types would be preferred and more efficient, limiting your planning abilities and creativity.  The game will complain about there being a ''housing crisis'' when the real problem is that citizens will not move into denser buildings.   City policies are negligible and can no longer be applied globally, instead having to be set per district.   Building upgrades are a great mechanic however.   Virtual texturing/texture streaming seems to struggle with alpha mapped objects (primarily hedges) causing them to look cubical with flat 2d planes sticking out of them. This happens even with less performance intensive cities.    Edit: Specs  GPU: GTX 1070TI  CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X   RAM 32GB  My settings: everything set to medium, disabled volumetrics, DOF and Motion blur. 70% resolution scaling.

172377285,english,1,424370,"I have a little history with Wolcen ,i tried it a few years ago and my computer had some problems,here on steam this is my second experience with this game.   Unfortunately my review comes at a time when developpers announced their plan to end the support for multiplayer and endgame content however there's enough content in the single player campaign and to be honest i was interested only in that. The after grind is not for me and there are better alternatives for that.  If you never heard of this game there are similar games like Path of Exiles or Diablo series,this can be a great choice if you're interested in action rpgs with dungeon crawling and loot-based progression.  I really liked the dark fantasy theme and visually the game is a feast for the eyes and for my surprise the voice acting was great for this kind of game. After some browsing i discovered popular voice actors from games i played before like dragon age or witcher 3.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311461899  In terms of gameplay everything was smooth with no major issues or bugs.. the movement was fluid and the dodge/roll responsive. With a huge arsenal of spells and combinations of talent trees you can create a unique character, featuring a classless system Wolcen doesn't lock you into a specific class !   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311376207  Another mechanic i enjoyed was the Apocalyptic Form, this transforms you into avatars with unique and powerful abilities ,there are multiple avatars you can unlock each with its own theme. Beyond the cool factor and amazing visuals there are strategic advantages during though battles or boss fights.  At this point in time i can only recommend this if you're looking for the single player content, for a great price during a sale of course.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311467285  Pros: - Great story with twists and betrayals - Voice acting  - Visuals  Cons: - If you want more than single player campaign,read the negative reviews  My review score  Story - 9 Gameplay- 8  Graphics- 8 Sound - 9  Overall - 8.5"

180612086,english,0,424370,"Wolcen is a mess of a game. I recently picked it up after they announced Online Play was being shuttered. As such, this review treats Wolcen as a singleplayer experience.   Wolcen has a solid foundation. It has decent moment-to-moment gameplay with satisfying combat and movement and decent character progression. The skill tree has an interesting ""rotation"" mechanic, allowing you to rearrange it to suit your needs. Your active skills have modifiers to their behavior that can be freely switched at any time, similar to Diablo 3's skill system. This opens the doors for lots of experimentation and varied behavior in skills. Gear crafting was almost cool, but the complete lack of transparency made it more frustrating to use. Voice acting made the admittedly cliche story much more engaging. The post-game has a cool ""city-builder"" gameplay loop, but it doesn't feel fully fleshed out.  The progression system's negatives begin to show themselves in the endgame. Many mechanics like multiple projectiles don't work properly, pets are an after thought, a loot filter is sorely needed, and leveling past 70 is a snooze without using cheats. Most stats are ""score based"" in their design, meaning they become less effective at higher level zones to artificially increase the difficulty by making your character weaker. Your crit/resistances/dodge rate/ailment application all get less effective the more you progress, bricking builds that rely on them. Enemy resistances also scale this way, with no way to shred them, which makes life leech less and less effective as you progress. You also cannot swap weapon sets, or save loadouts for skills/transmogrification, which would have been a great QoL addition.  There's a lot holding back Wolcen technically. The final cutscene of the game fails to load, skipping you to the credits. The UI doesn't always behave, where you can't pick up items or select certain UI elements, sometimes locking you in a menu. Animations are rough around the edges. The difficulty of the campaign needed to be cranked up a ton. It just got boring quickly even on max difficulty, despite the scenarios and maps being fairly well done.   For most people, I don't recommend picking up Wolcen. If you're morbidly curious, or starved for ARPG content, it's good value when discounted under $10."
182251489,english,0,424370,"Imagine selling over one million copies of your game within the first month of release, and you take the money and run four and a half years later, all the while your game isn't even finished. Fuck this company. Enjoy your yacht."
189462141,english,0,424370,"Ultimately, I can't recommend Wolcen.  In its current state, the game is as finished as it's going to get, bugs and half-baked storyline and all.  There's a history here: My understanding is that this game was, at launch, a buggy mess. A very *pretty* buggy mess, but still a mess. The devs made a lot of promises while overestimating the scope of the work to create and fix the game.  The released a final patch and then cut and run.  They posted a final update in Maty 2024 indicating the shutdown of multiplayer.  This may not be a direct scam, but it's a close as you get the classic Early Access tale of a developer not following through.  The current state of the game is playable. The story is very engaging, but fizzles out near the end (guessing because they ran out of money) so you get a sudden ""six months later"" epilogue (which is the endgame) in one of the most pivotal moments of the final act.  Combat, mechanics, are okay. Not amazing, I would say feels pretty clunky by PoE2 or D4 standards.  If you can get it for $4 and want to play single-player, that's probably worth your time, but right now the most valuable piece of this product is as a cautionary tale and a ""Remember Wolcen?"" among ARPG fans."
172231670,english,0,424370,They're shutting down the multiplayer functionality of the game instead of giving enough of a damn to give one last update for the game to run peer-to-peer or through some other method that doesn't require them hosting the servers themselves.  Don't make your multiplayer portion of your game entirely reliant on your own hosted servers if you don't know if you can host them indefinitely; it's practically worse than planned obsolescence.
184669820,english,0,424370,"The story of the game is actually good and it was fun playing together with others *BUT* it's now abandoned and servers are shut down. Co-op mode is therefore not working any more.

167244048,english,1,424370,"Wolcen is a fairly divisive Diablo-style ARPG with some interesting ideas with mixed implementation but having a few highlights as well. From my understanding, Wolcen was very heavily changed from original Kickstarter plans which annoyed backers. Then released most of the game after ending Early Access leading to a really rough and buggy launch. I picked it up on discount years after it's release, a number of minor bugs here and there and a few crashes but nothing totally game breaking in offline mode and the campaign has been 'finished'.  Wolcen is currently getting a lot of hate due to announcing on May 30th 2024 that they are ceasing further development and support for the game and closing the multiplayer servers on September 3, 2024. It was already pretty obvious that the devs were finished updating game, losing multiplayer is a bigger issue. I assume they choose to do this because Wolcen player pop is pretty low. Unfortunately, like many other modern games, there is no alternate local multi-player supported so once the servers are closed multiplayer functionality will cease. The Community Manager reported that the devs are planning to release a ""Import Online Character"" button to download and convert your online character to an offline one, even when the server is already shut down so at least there's that.   Pros: * Has one of the better campaigns in the genre I'd say. A bit cliche at times but well done with decent cutscenes, voice acting, good character designs and a few interesting characters. The final fourth chapter was released post-release and is weaker than original (no waypoints, it's more of a rougue-lite type experience with a couple of story missions and a lot of grinding to be able to fight the final boss Ahriman) but still overall worth finishing off the campaign. * Graphics are overall pretty good. * Has a passive 'wheel' instead of a passive 'tree' like most ARPGs. There are three tiers of the wheel and you can rotate the nodes in each tier allowing you to adjust the 'wheel' for a better path through the layout. Provides a bit more complexity than some other ARPGs while not being as complicated as something like POE's passive system. * Attributes and skills can be refunded. Refunding attributes gets damn expensive at really high levels but it's available. Also, there's no fixed class and can learn all skills so if you want to try out a different playstyle you don't need to create and level an entirely new characters. * Skills can be upgraded with a limited number of special traits which lets you make some big changes to how they function and also come with a pool of damage types they can be converted to. * Hybrid builds are interesting; the game has two resources, willpower and rage, and hybrids have to juggle these resources by using rotating between skills that use either of these. * There's an active Dark Souls type dodge you can use to roll out of trouble. * In post-game you can gain ability to duplicate skills up to two times.  Neutral: * Passive wheel could use maybe a couple of additional nodes maybe. There's only one node for summoners for example. Not a huge issue through. * Duplicate skills share the same cooldown which is a bit of pain. It let you have two versions of a skill with different traits I guess but it's only really good for summon skills. Would have preferred zero cooldown but only one duplicatation instead of two.  Cons: * The campaign is too easy overall. Trash is not a threat and boss health bars drop insanely fast. Combined with the multiple ressurects, there's not enough challenge in the base campaign until maybe final two bosses in Act 4. Some nice set pieces, the end of chapter fights have an epic feel to them but you got to push deep into post game content to get to the challenging content. I wish there was a 'Hard' campaign difficulty in addition to the existing 'Normal' and 'Story' difficulties where bosses had a lot more health. * All bosses are one shot fights. So no farming of the bosses possible. Also you can't go back to past chapters. Not a huge issue in offline mode but I hear it might be able to mess up your game in online if you're in a game which is in another chapter but not sure. * Post-game gets a little repetive. It's just doing random rogue-lite missions agaisnt increasingly high level enemies. Want more fights against big bosses. * While you can learn all skills, the ones you can actively use are restricted to what you have equipped in hands. It's a bit too restrictive at times, wish they made some utility/defensive skills have no gear restrictions rather binding every skill to using a weapon/off-hand type. A few additional skills would also have been welcome. * Skillbar is extremely small. You only get four skill slots (you can unlock a fifth slot for all chars starting from act 4/post-campaign). With the way summon skills work (summoning automatically) + duplicated skills, more skills slots would probably not balance well with summoners but feels a bit limiting for other builds. * Stash space is a bit meh. Only five tabs available. You start with one, the second you can buy for a small chunk of gold and the final three are only available post campaign. I assume they were originally planned to be sold as MTX or something lol. * Attack/spell animations cannot be cancelled which makes using the active dodge and potions extremely janky at times. * Some balance issues. Bows for example, attack animations are slow af which makes it harder to active dodge attacks sometimes. Because they are slow it's harder to generate rage attacking. In addition, bows users have no skills for generating rage while melee have two! * Apocalyptic mode is a massive letdown. You gain resource while playing which lets you activate it. It convert you into one of four invunerable massive aspects that come with fixed unique skill sets, you can de-activate it early or wait until you run out of resource to sustain it. They're extremely clunky to use and honestly I'd rather have my normal skills. The only real good use they have it become invunerable and avoid deaths and restore Energy Shield. Would have been better if they just provided your character with some buffs.   Personally I think Wolcen is worth at least a couple of playthrough through its campaign with a couple of builds. Going deep into the post-game can be pretty repetitive but the post-game content is unlocked for all characters so you don't need to worry about grinding up expedition levels on all your characters. If you're only interested in multi-player you'd probably want to pass as that will be gone soon. As part of the dev update, they announced that Wolcen will be available later (probably when multi-player officially closes) to purchase at a new, permanently reduced price. So either wait for the price to be reduced or a big discount (last big sale was ~90% off I think)."
166723101,english,0,424370,"I really enjoyed the mechanics for Wolcen & i think its a great game (sure turning champions of Stormfall into an endless chapter 4 sucks but not that much)   WOULD IT REALLY BE SO HARD TO MAKE THE ONLINE FOR THE GAME PEER TO PEER VIA STEAMWORKS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN KEEP PLAYING WITH THERE FRIENDS!?  I'll be unlikely to purchase any future produts from the devs in future."

177103458,english,1,424370,"Definitely more deserving than the mixed reviews sentiment it's getting. Got it on sale, and it's worth every cent. While there are many rough corners (and the loss of multiplayer), the story so far is relatively engaging (more so than D4) and there are interesting enough mechanics to not be a carbon copy of POE/Diablo/et al.   Some of my gripes: - You can't combine potions or gems?? Leading to a ton of inventory waste? Even then, gem levels don't seem to differentiate that much from one to another - Targeting enemies/things can sometimes be painful and not seamless (e.g. as a spellcaster, trying to hit breakable items works 60% of the time) - Equipment/gold/etc seems very unbalanced. Loot never seems amazing (even legendaries) and you get a pittance of gold from selling items  What I enjoyed: - For a 'indie' game, it's beyond beautiful in a way that AAA games wished they could. There are many many moments worth taking a breather from the spam-rolling and spell-casting, to just enjoy the aesthetic and design of the maps - The skill tree is pretty decent (although i did wish the opportunity cost of using a set of skills over another was less severe). Unlike the POE skilltree which requires a master's degree and then some, this was very straightforward + extensive enough. - The soundtrack is just... 10/10. I also most enjoyed the voice acting  Wolcen could have been something great with better studio support and/or investment, but whatever has come of it is still pretty darn enjoyable!"

So I didn't get to experience the multiplayer aspect of the game at all.  That said, I enjoyed the single-player campaign tremendously.  The graphics looked great with everything turned up to max.  The story is different enough from the standard fantasy fare, and even offers up some wicked twists.  The dialogues are well-written and get better as the story progresses.  Like others I also thought the voice acting was outstanding.  As far as game play, I liked the ability to play as any class just by switching weapons. The different skill and spells are a lot of fun to experiment with.  I enjoyed this game much more than Diablo 3 single player.   This game showed a lot of promise.  It's too bad the way the way the studio ended left a bad taste for many people.  I hope they learned from this and if they would make other games in the future, I would be interested."

Tried a steam refund on the grounds of ""I've literally never been able to play the game properly, and I was hoping they'd fix those bugs so I actually could?""   But alas they denied it.   Fast forward to now, it's been completely abandoned and left in a garbage state. Can't speak for the actual gameplay because I couldn't really experience it, but the rest of the situation is enough for me to say avoid."
165632865,english,0,424370,"Dumpster fire ARPG!!  Never thought id feel scammed after spending only $3 on this game, but i did. Basically in an alpha/pre-release state. Dont waste your money.  Looking for a good ARPG? check out: Grim Dawn Titan Quest Path of Exile Last Epoch Diablo Van Helsing Torch light Lost Ark Minecraft Dungeons  The list goes on, but skip this POS!! Trust me not worth playing even if it was free!!!"

182453490,english,1,424370,"As always it is about expectations. When you expect a coop game you are a few years too late. However if you expect a single player game with a good story it is worth picking up on a discount. In my opinion it is one of the better ARPGs out there.  There are some flaws and bugs which are not getting fixed anymore, but none of them is game breaking. Endgame levelling is a chore and sometimes annoying due to weird design decisions, like random immunity shields on enemies for certain damage types. It should have been tweaked after making the game single player only but that's maybe just me.  All in all it is still worth a playthrough"
188897010,english,1,424370,"very hesitant recommend, i picked this up when it went on sale for dirt cheap and had no idea about the drama other then the fact they were discontinuing service. that aside i did really enjoy my time with acts 1-3 just arrived to act 4 and from what i understand and have seen so far this will likely end my run since they just repurposed end game and slapped a few story beats on top of it. the story was pretty enjoyable even if its a your he chosen one type of story. some of the enemy designs are really cool too. the thing i find the most unique is around act getting the ability to transform into a giant god-like thing but other then visuals it felt underpowered for what it was. the skill tree feels like it wants to be POE but decided to not copy the homework completly with the rotating boards to switch your class on the fly, oh forgot to mention that this game is classless most games like this force you into a role and while this game does to you dont have to reroll a character to switch builds. its ashame they abandoned it as it had a lot of promise gameplay and story wise hope maybe one day they will give us a wolcen 2 and this time not get in over their heads and finish it.  p.s. they are working on a pvpve style game with similar gameplay and its free to play, id avoid it after how they handled this game, expect likely after that game flops they most likely will close studio."
175989800,english,1,424370,"It's like Final Fantasy and Path of Exile had a baby, absolutely brilliant.  This is the best ARPG I have ever played hands down.  It's a crying shame that I just discovered it and now its offline only with no further development, still however a solid 10/10 though."
177487646,english,1,424370,"Having played around 75 hours of this game, I can say that it made me nostalgic for playing Grim Dawn - which I put 600 hours into... This game is not bad, but it's lacking. Still for the content it has you can still get some fun out of it, but get it on sale, especially now that online servers have been shutdown."
169453371,english,1,424370,"Updated: 14-7-2024  Ok, so, I know this game is dead, and no further development will be done. I bought this game on sale for 3.99 euro, as I have always wanted to give it a go as a fairly hardcore ARPG player (4k+ hours in PoE, and more in D2, D3 and D4, also a couple hours in Last Epoch and Grim Dawn), generally I was always busy with some other ARPG then Wolcen, hence why I am late to the game. I always believe in the fact that you can't judge a ARPG until you have a decent amount of hours in the end game, as most of the ""storyline"" is just to get you to the ""endless"" endgame to grind for gear perfection for your build.   TL:DR; (full review below the plus and minus points) All in all, recommended *single player* ARPG to try and add to your collection if you are a fan of the genre and are willing to see some bad stuff ""through the fingers"" - buy on a Discount only (although I find it worth the 20+ euro's price tag, but that's just me, and it does not help the development of the game anymore, so the choice is yours :P).  Plus points: - Development has stopped; so if you happen to find a broken and OP build - it won't get nerfed anymore. - Awesome sound track! (Think combination of first Halo intro, WoW (Barrens), Starwars) - Decent single player story line / campaign that takes about 20hrs to finish in a first time play through - Good graphics for an ARPG (you need a beefy system, I have a OC 12900K and  4090 at the time of writing, and still sometimes dips to 40 fps (Wardstone, huge amount of enemies / animations) - A lot of customization options (builds and looks)  - Dyes, customisation of looks / gear - Voice actress for female character from Dragon Age Inquisition! - Many other good voice actors! - Enough ""talent tree"" ways to go to keep you busy and theory crafting for a long time - Some pretty heavy / difficult to get achievements to keep you busy and improve your build to achieve, for example, reaching max level without dying  Bad points: - Development has stopped; so if you happen to find a game breaking bug, it won't get fixed anymore. - Good graphics for an ARPG (you need a beefy system, I have a OC 12900K and  4090 at the time of writing, and still sometimes dips to 40 fps (Wardstone, huge amount of enemies / animations, especially if you have a toxic explosion build with lingering poison clouds, but worth it as it looks very satisfying xD) - End game consists of re-playing act 4 endlessly, and get's ""boring"" as it's the same grind over and over without much change. - Voice lines from NPC's become anoying - even though they are good and funny for the most part - End game is weird and undocumented what it is and does (I still don't know half of what building my city actually does, how the production works etc)  - Some ""bad"" issues with difficulty / scaling (example: same tier difficulty wardstone can be a cakewalk and no effort, but when you start a new one from the war table (especially the ward stone ones with the revive dudes or warhammer guys) it becomes a lot more difficult) - Multiplayer will be dead soon, so don't even bother trying it (might already be dead by the time you read this review), see this as a pure single player game! - The super annoying robot guy missions where you have to guide him around a Fog of war - he is slow AF, He has annoying lines to say, and his voice is annoying.. I skip these by default now that I know which missions they are (basically as soon as it says ""A contact named"" in the description, I skip it XD) - Some pretty heavy / difficult to get achievements (some impossible after multiplayer shuts down) - Personal stash with only 5 tabs, of which a couple are behind a ""build this shizzle in your city to unlock"" message, this should just have been able to buy with gold - imho, but I kind of get the decision here. - Greed shrines are insanely badly balanced.. (and unclear) You will likely die the first time you encounter them, be prepared :P   ------  Long story short - this game has/had insane potential to be what they set out it to be ""One amongst the greatest"", honestly I really feel it could have made it. Unfortunately the end game is now just a loop of ""Act 4"", and this could have been fine if they reworked it slightly and removed some of the endless same NPC lines. The wartable could have been a great endgame part to the whole story, if they managed to expand on it a little and made it endless with more bosses then just Arhiman. Maybe also added some more open world exploration / things to do.   It feels like this game sits in between Diablo and PoE in terms of ""Difficulty"" to understand and make awesome builds, Where PoE is more complex, and Diablo is the casual game.   I hope the devs have learned valuable lessons for the future, and I wish them all the best of luck. I will be playing Wolcen for a decent amount more hours as I always get into the ""Can I make THIS work?"" trap of ARPG's and I love it. Plenty more builds I have in mind, so even if I have to hear the NPC repeat themselves another 1000x times, I'll be fine.  All in all, if you are looking for something different to try in ARPG land, give this a go on sale for a 5er. Storyline is about 25ish hours in solo gameplay to get through, which is worth it alone. The gameplay feels a bit cumbersome in the first hour, but once you get the hang of it (and are willing to learn what works and what doesn't) you will  be rewarded with a very decent single player ARPG experience - which could have been ""Amongst the best"".  On a final note: Ignore all the negativity - some games die without a fuss, some games die for variety of reasons, this game dies because developers have decided the project got to difficult to complete after multiple changes made to the game / code. It happens, but this is still very enjoyable to play (single player) and have not come accross major game breaking issues, and only 1 random crash in endgame. If you love ARPG's give it a go as long as it's below 5 Euro's / Pounds / Dollars / whatever. It's worth more IMHO, but it's dead, so it's up to you :P  All in all, without going further, recommended single player ARPG to try and add to your collection :-)"
190507775,english,1,424370,Interesting.  Looks like they shut down multiplayer.  Picked this up on sale to check out and it's a solid Diablo vibe.  I actually like the skill system and it has a cleaner interface in parts.  I normally play solo anyway except on the boss fights in Diablo IV which is fun to scamper into and then go about my way.    Totally worth the $5 price tag but it doesn't look supported anymore.  Amazing artwork and scenes as well.  Even Diablo team could learn from some of it..  Some amazing scenes so far and great thematics.
178011553,english,1,424370,"Played when the servers were shot down already. so online players might be drawn away.  Minus a few crashes, and the grind at the end. The controls, the gameplay and the story were fun."
164426932,english,0,424370,"Haven't played for over a year.  Was full of bugs before but provided some mindless entertainment, and I enjoyed the setting and the story for the most part.  Come back to check it out again and learn the devs have abandoned the project.  But before they did, they slashed my character's level down to 40 and took ALL of my items and gold and replaced it with a bunch of trashy generic stuff.  Truly, unbelievable.  Just rug-pulled every hour I spent into this game.  To make that even worse, believe it or not, my character and all or most NPC's around me will be blurry more often than not.  Not motion blur.  I can be standing still.  SO many bugs, and the devs are gone, and they killed my character and my ability to enjoy the game.  DEFINITELY do not buy this trash.  Or anything from anyone who was an executive at this trash company."
163830289,english,0,424370,"Combat feels nice to me, story, especially characters in it, are meh at best. Overall despite the reviews I really, really enjoyed it. TOO BAD IT F****NG BROKE AFTER THE BIG BOSS FIGHT AND I CAN'T PROGRESS. Vendors went AWOL, portal doesn't work, can't interact with NPCs, quest has no objective. So yeah, eat it, devs."
185614730,english,1,424370,"Wolcen is a game that gives you a dog, but doesn't let you pet it.  It's a solid ARPG with great mechanics that consistently stop just a little short.  The combat and character progression are the best part of the experience.  The game loop is addictive and creates a feeling of becoming more powerful as you progress. Unfortunately you become incredibly OP to early, and the game loses all challenge about half way through.  You want to see this world and to kill these monsters, because they are so well designed.  The set piece battles are epic.  You will want to revisit locations to replay major events, but you can't do either.  Once you progress a chapter you're prevented from revisiting anything you've already completed.  The voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard in an ARPG, but the writing is inconsistent.  Credit to the voice talent for doing so much good work with such poor dialog.  The story jumps between Warhammer 40K and 90s California slag.  The dialog can break immersion, and the convoluted story is just confusing.  Dialog may go something like,""Justicar Maelys  will lead the legion of light to victory over that total tool Naerlog and the Cult of the Blind.  The Mizzeonth will rise for the fourth time in this second age, and Janaris will regain the throne of Stormfall..... NOT.""  I don't know who I'm fighting for or why, and I'm expecting a Jerry Springer reference at any moment.  The endgame is a fun loop for a few hours, but lacks real depth.  It requires grind just to unlock things that should be available by default.  For example the right stick button is locked for the entire game, but can be unlocked by grinding for 20+ hours in endgame.  The game literally locks the ability to rebind controls until you grind to the very end of endgame to unlock them.  By the time I was able to use all the controls and rebind my keys I was done playing the game.  Wolcen is a fun 60 hour experience, that I recommend playing.  You will enjoy this game, but will also be left with a feeling that it could have been so much more.  Wolcen gives you a dog, but doesn't let you pet it. 6/10"

This game has several bugs and MANY things that makes it irritating to play, extremely rng driven  crafting. The only thing good I have to say about this game is the possibilities of builds you can make (although not everything will work the best) but event that would need the right equipment to suit the build needs (already told about the rng gear, right?) I got to lvl 90 with a very good build and equipment that I got lucky to drop but now I want to test other builds and equips and nothing works well. Sad that I wanted to get full achievements but I just don't have the desire to use the same build forever when there's so many possibilities"

166428339,english,0,424370,"tl;dr: IMO good game, awful dev studio  I actually like the game, but the dev studio is awful. First they completely change what was initially crowdfunded, then the release story is left on a cliff hanger for YEARS to focus on a roguelite post-game mode despite the community begging them to stop and finish the story, then when player numbers drop they panic and finally release more story content, then they just give up and are going to cut off multiplayer soon. The community had to fight them to get things done and IMO what was done was good, but jesus christ it's like pulling teeth with this studio. And now it's being abandoned."

168282883,english,1,424370,"Not gonna lie, game was underwhelming at launch. Now that I'm playing it after a ton of updates and the game basically dying: I'm kinda sad. It's definitely not a finely tuned arpg, nor a very complex one. It has its flaws. But it's fun. Actually very fun... Kinda sucks the devs are abandoning it, I hope they made enough to make something better next time, I'll be curious."
173125121,english,0,424370,"When this game came out it looked promising so I bought it. At the early stages of the game I had some fun until I found out the balancing is crap, the design is crap, the story is crap and even the devs seemed kinda crap because they promised things.   Now, years later I came back to check if its finally at the stage that was promised all that time ago and I only find out the game is still crap and the devs bailed on it. In their goodbye-note they said something along the lines of ""We strive for excellence"" which was the funniest shit I've read in a while, because they never even came anywhere close to decent let alone ""excellence"".  That joke alone made this worthless game almost worth the money. Almost."
188166160,english,1,424370,"Got it on deep sale recently. So while I get those that really invested in this game, I can say if you can get it cheap will be happy with single player and if you are ok doing some simple mods like camera, enemy HP (way too low), you can really hone this in to a fun ARPG. I would say it gets quite a bit better after the story, I do agree during the story the pacing is almost the same all the way through, quite a bit of change up in the after story though."
176962053,english,1,424370,"The amount of people giving this game a negative review because online functionality got taken down is absurd.  The amount of people claiming it's just a quick cash grab is absurd. No cash grab receives the amount of updates this got.  You literally got entire new acts added to the game, but no, that isn't enough for people, declare it a cash grab!   Get a grip and enjoy an actually very good game. I may not play it often but I always have a fun time when I do."

193334539,english,0,424370,This game was good when it first came out into early access. It had potential to possibly be as good or better than diablo 3 and PoE. After the release of Diablo 4 and PoE 2 they abandoned multiplayer and obviously aren't interested in competing with these games anymore. They gave up. I didn't invest in the game's early access so they could give up. I can't recommend that anyone buy this game.
177442838,english,1,424370,This is one of the better Diablo like games out there. It is in the top ten. The gameplay is really good. its only SP and OFFLINE! which is a huge plus over Diablo 4....

176462277,english,1,424370,"The game is excellent. The developers borrowed the best from similar projects: Grim Dawn, Sacred, PoE, Lost Ark, Diablo. This game is similar to all of them at once. There's nothing wrong with that if the game turned out to be engaging. The developers abandoned their creation, which is unfortunate. I decided to familiarize myself with the story. The story is trivial, but it's presented in an interesting way. I like the graphics. The customization system is well implemented. The ability to choose your own path is the main thing. The absence of standard classes is not new, and here the player can choose their own path. The passing locations are not difficult, the boss fights made me sweat. Skill leveling is pleasing: there is the possibility of choosing preferred elements and additional abilities, depending on the need. The weapon and armor system is quite good. If you don't focus on the death of the project and its similarity to all isometric games, you can have a good time."
186751937,english,0,424370,"Game has good ideas, but its has multiple problems. Also, there are better options in the market. The best thing of this game, is the price.  Reasons: - Boring loot drops - Boring mob grouping / amount - Side quests bugged, which do not spawn the target enemies - maps are super linear, barely any reward for exploration - camera is too damn close - terrible waypoints locations, either they are too close, or too far - they killed the multiplayer, way too soon - multiple bugs still left to be fixed (game is abandoned by the devs) - terrible minions AI - too many breakcables in every map"

To make them stop you have to clear from mobs a laughably enormous range. -melee builds are underpowered and ranged ones are completely destroyed when you find a boss with inpenetrable shield and forces you to go in melee range to be destroyed -some very damaging ground effects are almost invisible -evasion move does not go around obstacles and unpassable terrain is often not well visually highlighted -crafting is worse than a slot machines with almost completely random results  TLDR: lots of stuff that is a unforgivable sin in a ARPG. No wonder they failed miserably"

This game isnt the best performer. Graphically optimized, but if you can hang in about 15 minutes, make the necessary adjustments, then this one will grow on you. Like fungus on a tree grow.

Yes the servers have been shut down and the online functionnalitiees are off, however the game is still plyable as a single player game and has lots of content for a single player title.   Now I read most reviews and do find funny that most gamers are moaning about the servers being shutdown when they weren't playing the game when there was online functinnalities, the 10 or so who did well got enough hours out of it, get over yourselves the game is still in a very playable state, some games shutdown forever and we can't play them after buying them. Does it suck to not be able to play coop anymore? Sure and online coop would have been nice, but on the other hand it could have shutdown for good and we would have no more game.   Yeah it's sold at 25$ which is more than enough for the content you're getting. So for anyone searching for a single player ARPG with nice graphics because you have that hitch then go for it, the game is often on sale and you will get some good time out of it. I would say the game reminds me a lot of Van Helsing in its structure and approach but is different in character building. The Negative reviews are mostly gamers as usual unhappy to not have multiiplayer which they were barely touching."

It is a finished game with no more updates, for me it is a good point but be advised that nothing new will be added. Be advised that the servers are closed, it is only playable offline and solo. As another good point, the character file can be updated manually in wordpad if you want to cheat a little."

Finished the story with a streamer friend and never went back. Now they're shutting down online servers, so it seems now it'll only be single player."
166363586,english,0,424370,"this was a very interesting coop game with many classes and lots of combo builds. Until the developers did a reset and put high level characters back to level 40.  A town that was almost built was suddenly back to square one, the money and hard-earned loot was gone and replaced by trash generic items. after this “update”, which felt more like a “down”, i no longer had any desire to play the game, which i had previously enjoyed very much.  so i'm not surprised that not even the developers are interested in their own game.  downgraded to offline single player game   *thumbs down*"
190897295,english,0,424370,"Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem is not really a bad game, but it is not a good game either. The campaign is fun for the first 2 acts, act 3 slides down the fun ladder considerably and the ending gives you blue balls. Act 4 shits the bed and kicks you in the nuts, it's tedious and boring.  The skill system and skill point system is hard to get your head around, but the worst offender in this game is the loot system. I played until lvl. 50 and all the time I had no idea what made loot good or bad, there are to many damage types, resistence types etc. and I didn't know if my new stuff is in any way better than what I had before. The crafting is horrible don't even bother, because it is 100% random. The game has a to dark colour pallet, it's hard to see anything on some of the maps.  I give the game a 5/10, not recommended."

168377317,english,0,424370,"I actually enjoyed the first few chapters and thought the music was perfect fit for D4. I really like the talent tree too, the aesthetics and whole concept of it, but this isn't enough. Unfortunately there were a lot of bugs including not being able to see spells and it was just frustrating. By the time I got to the last chapter, it felt like a slog and was desperate to get it over and done with for the sake of finishing the campaign. The 'endgame', if you wanna call it that is terrible and just goes nowhere. Couldn't be bothered at all. This had so much potential. Funnily enough I hated D4 too and couldn't even finish the campaign on release. So many ARPG's have potential but end up being complete garbage or pay to win.   I don't think the devs are going to save this game, come back to it, do a complete overhaul and work on it to the point where endgame is polished and engaging like Last Epoch or PoE. It's had its time, released, was a huge flop and that's it. and that's why I absolutely cannot recommend it. Maybe, just maybe if you want to try it out of curiosity to see how bad it is, then get it on sale when it's 90% off for 3 bucks as it's priced now in the summer sale. Other than that, I highly recommend getting Grim Dawn, Last Epoch, Path of Exile of course, Diablo 3, Chronicon and honestly even Torchlight 2 to scratch that ARPG itch."

166496961,english,0,424370,"Будем откровенны: у игры есть интересная задумка и хорошо проработанные механики для создания персонажа, которые в некоторых аспектах превосходят те, что есть в PoE. Однако, несмотря на это, я не рекомендую покупать её даже по очень большой скидке. Разработчики, похоже, не смогли сопоставить свои амбиции с возможности, в результате чего получился просто некачественный продукт.   На момент написания этого обзора разработчики уже извинились и заявили, что не будут поддерживать игру. Они также сообщили, что учтут полученный опыт при создании новых проектов. Надеюсь, это действительно так."
167130193,english,0,424370,"As someone who has backed and supported the game in 2016 (!), Wolcen is just another tragedy for the ""promised vs. delivered"" trainwrecks. The devs did a 180° degree turn already years ago and did never really deliver what was promised.  Now we got the rugpull: The onlineservices will be shutdown. They actually abandoned the game already a year ago so that comes to no surprise.  The game had potential but they never finished it anyway and just went the safe route and quit with just another generic ARPG.  I got my 100 hours out of it but I don't recommend even buying this in a sale. It is a dead game, it never was living to begin with. It is a shame.   Play Grim Dawn instead or wait for PoE2 and Titanquest 2. Now even Diablo 4 is the better game than Wolcen and that is all you need to know."
166337178,english,0,424370,"05.30.2024 The developers announce that they will no longer support the game with new updates and will remove multiplayer to move on to new projects. Borderline scam product,  I will no longer buy games from these developers."

167786848,english,0,424370,"This ARPG has impressive visuals but falls short in its gameplay. The character movement feels stiff, and the interface is confusingly designed. Despite being filled with many different creatures to fight, they all feel like generic lego blocks and lack personality or unique characteristics. While the game looks great, it fails to deliver a satisfying experience for those looking for a deeper, more engaging ARPG."
166481442,english,0,424370,"I played this game when it first came out, and it was a fun little Diablo clone that had some promise for the future. It's a shame that the devs never got around to finishing the story, and have decided to officially call it quits. It seems like this was just one long cash grab."
167552643,english,1,424370,"Played 4 years ago in early access. The campaign was good ( 3 chapters), maybe a bit short. I always looked at this game as a single player ARPG to scratch the itch of the genre while waiting for Diablo IV etc and therefore I was pleasantly surprised with the package offered by then. I played the game, finished the campaign and lost interest in the endgame.  I did the same with Diablo4, the seasons have been a total joke so I believe I got my value for money out of this game. The main difference between Wolcen Studio and other companies is the marketing/money available. They have made a great game to be enjoyed by the ARPG crowd and I advise everyone that can give it a go (especially now with the reduced price) to give it a go. A true ARPG with diversified loot and excellent presentation and it came out way before Diablo 4 with a lot of the same vibes in game. I still recommend it."
166543382,english,0,424370,"I played for quite a few of their major releases, suffered through game-breaking bugs with an unusual patience because I wanted to give them a chance.  However, now, they have decided to remove multiplayer from the game, this game now has no purpose whatsoever. Why play Wolcen when you can play Grim dawn, or Path of Exile (the latter being free btw) AND can be done with friends. I would rather play Hellfire than Wolcen now.  The devs have abandonned the game, so should everyone else, including Steam.  EDIT (09/03/2024) : They have decided to make, before it closes, a way to transfer online characters into offline, so it's a really good thing for people that still plays. Now, I may have been a tad bit judgemental upon the closing announcement, but I still think people should not buy the game now that it is bound to be deprecated. I did make it sound way worse than it is."
166779198,english,0,424370,"Rating: 4/10  Polish: 2/10  Price I would recommend this game: $4    I got this game when it went early access. It went through a lot of iterations for mechanics. Before the last big push to get out of early access. I liked what I saw early on in EA, however the scope of the final project clearly was too much for this team even with early access funds keeping them afloat. The game never felt finished, riddled with bugs, performance issues, and balance issues. Now they are turning off multiplayer and there will be no more updates. I'd say its worth it for $4 play solo, check it out, you can sink time into it but the endgame really isn't there and however the mechanics were unique and I applaud them for trying. Hopefully they stick to a more basic scope for future projects and not live service arpgs."
174790901,english,1,424370,"One of the ARPGs with the best Story (and voice acting) that i have played In this game, your character actually has personal motivation to do things, instead of just beeing the chosen one or whatever This makes playing through the campaign really enjoyable (much more so than PoEs or LEs campaigns) Though i dont think there is much endgame afterwards, but the one-time (45h) experience was good and worth it for me"
169955320,english,0,424370,"abandoned and incomplete. Lazy Devs didn't want to fix the game, instead they ignored it for a year then dropped a BS statement about how they tried, but have to move on. Absolute trash company and game only got worse as they worked on it from initial launch,"

As a summoner main in these types of games, that's all I needed to know.  That being said, Wolcen is a decent non-class based ARPG.  If you are a fan of the genre, getting this game on sale for under $10 is a steal regardless of where it ranks in your list of Top 10 favorite top-down ARPG hack and slash dungeon crawlers."
183111505,english,0,424370,"Has its good sides and I had some fun playing, but the devs either lacked ""vision"" how to solidify their ideas or they lacked skills to do it.

166348264,english,0,424370,"Well I was on the edge about this game. It has some nice visuals and atmosphere, the story was interesting, the combat was okay but got stale pretty quick. The UI. The UI was awful. Especially with a controller. Focusing between parts of the screen was a very weird design choice and equipping armour was so incredibly awkward. Lack of comparing items with L and R variations was so tedious.   It was just announced that Co-op is shutting down and no further updates are coming. The game is officially dead and we're stuck with this janky disappointing UI and whatever bugs exist are now permanent.   Severely regretting buying this game."
184759982,english,1,424370,"On launch the game was in a terrible state, and online mode is laggy even to this day, I was shocked to see a game I supported since alpha be worse than when it was in alpha after years of development. With some updates the offline mode became actually playable and I hope the devs luck. Still a way better game than Last Epoch, at least it has some new innovative ideas. Overall score 6/10  Get on sale and try the offline mode, good for quite a few hours of gameplay."
191511897,english,0,424370,Dont waste the money. I have tried multiple times to play this game over several years and they haven't fixed any of the graphical bugs.

166719616,english,0,424370,"Should have refunded when I had the chance.  To elaborate further: Wolcen is a lesser son of greater men, so to speak. It incorporates bits and pieces from other, much better action RGPs, such as PoE's skill tree, randomized loot, Last Epoch's and PoE's skill customization, but it does it all much worse. The game is sorta pretty. It controls reasonably well. The endgame is a disappointment and it's just a mediocre game through and through.  Two aboslutely deplorable things that have happened to this game were the Kickstarter bait and switch, and now they're permanently shutting down the multiplayer with LITERALLY NO OTHER OPTION. No privately hosted servers. No peer to peer. No LAN multiplayer. Nothing. At. All. If I tried hard enough I could probably define this as false advertisement but alas, I'm no lawyer.  Through my 10+ years on Steam, I've bought games that I ended up not liking. Some of them I refunded. Some of them I kept and just wrote off as a loss. Maybe I'll get the will to play them at some other point?  But few games make me as assmad as this one does. Not only has it overpromised and underdelivered, not only is it not even completely fixed, now they're spitting in your food and telling you to lick the plate.  This is one of maybe 3 purchases I deeply, deeply regret. I'm gonna be fighting tooth and nail for that God damned refund. Either I get my money back, or I get VAC banned.  There are so many good indie games out there that deserve the attention, and instead we're stuck with this garbage.  I hope the developers are happy. May they never set foot in the game industry again."
63755684,english,0,424370,"I really wanted to recommend this one, I really did... I had a blast with it the first couple hours, experimenting with build ideas, finding new spells, and abilities, and was even getting into the mediocre story... Then shortly after Chapter 2 started the entire game fell apart.  I want to start by saying that this game has potential, and I do like it, and I would tell you buy it in a heart beat if you're reading this months after release, and you know they have fixed the problems. I'm gonna start out with the good.  THE GOOD: - Amazing Doom/Warhammer/Diablo art style, and theme. - The most refreshing take on character skills/talents in an ARPG, or better yet RPG i've seen in a while. - Unique, and thought out spells/abilities - Limitless potential for builds. There's literally room here for anything you can think of. - Feels like the first next gen arpg on the market. (for what is actually done.) - If this studio pulls their shit together Wolcen will give the big boy arpgs a run for their money.  Now lets get into what is unacceptable about this game, and why I wont be recommending, or playing it until things change...  THE BAD:  - This game has an absolutely unacceptable amount of game breaking bugs for it to be considered a full release let alone a 40$ one. This is 1st/2nd year early access level.  -  I can't make it through a single stage without getting stuck on the floor defenseless, or without the audio cutting out. The enemies are either one punch chumps, or bullet sponges from hell.   - The difficulty ""curve"" is more like a roller coaster. One minute thinking you have a decent build to the next wanting to respec, but not being able to due to the extremely low drop rate of the currency you need to respec while leveling. I get wanting end game respec to be expensive, but while leveling the rates should be WAY lower. A skill/talent system this big takes time to get used to, and find a viable build. You should be able to fix mistakes without feeling like you are being stopped by a paywall that doesn't actually exist.  - The entire game is severely unbalanced. I've seen some builds literally go god mode on this game while others make completing the game literally impossible, and with the insane cost to respec, you better hope you do your homework, or you'll be grinding before you're half way through the story. This also isn't just due to imbalance either...   - A serious chunk of the passives just don't work period, and this doesn't help the fact that there's virtually no information in the game about what each stat does there really is no way to take chances, which I think defeats the purpose of a game like this.  - If you do play, and end up making it to the end of the first chapter, and getting your angel/mech suit thing, don't pick the reaper/chaos one, because it doesn't work. I spent an hour in the chapel/holdout stage shortly after getting it watching my character jump around the screen while that horrible computer crashing audio skip blasted my ears, only the finally be stuck casting a spell for another 2 minutes, only to be dropped dead on the floor.   - There are some awful UI bugs as well. Items being dragged under the gem window, or not being able to directly drag armor from the gem vendor window back to yourself without having to drop it in your bag first, having to click a few times here, a few times there to get the ui to respond, Oh and on Ultrawide resolutions seeing editor lighting/animation cuts off the side of the cut scenes.    All in all the 15 1/2 hours I spent with this game felt like I was working QA, or playing a new early access game. Just didn't feel like it was even to a beta stage. Late alpha at best. This would be fine if this is what the studio was selling, but it isn't. This awful habit the industry has picked up has got to stop, and it doesn't matter if it's the big AAA studios, or the underdog. I don't care if you're a small studio, or not. It's a outright deceptive practice. If development didn't go as planned, and you have backers to satisfy then do the right thing, and take the hit. Release it as an early access, make some in game goodies for the loyal fans, and release it when it's ready.  Regardless of all of that I really do hope I can come back, and change this review, and I hope the devs apologize for this launch instead of just blaming the ""server load"". That's obviously an issue, but that seems to be the patsy in this case. It seems to be more of a coding nightmare/lack of QA that is really the cause of this games issues right now."
132944580,english,1,424370,"I had this game on my wish list since it came out , but after the it came out the reception wasn't great so I didn't buy it. Over the years the game got lots of updates and it was on sale multiple times but due to mixed reviews I never pulled the trigger until it was £7.70 and at that point I though if its crap I won't even mind, but I can tell you all that is not the case. I don't know when the game got to the state it is now but I don't think there has been a better time to play it, I put 50 hours into the game before I wrote this review mostly because a lot of people are still complaining and I just don't know why? This isn't a game that you will play for the rest of your life, the campaign was a little too short I can agree with that but apparently more is to come this year and the Champion of Stormfall mode will keep you busy for a good while and its miles better that silly rifts like you get in Diablo III , to me this is one of the better ARPG's I've ever played , it actually took me away from playing Diablo II Resurrected which is not an easy thing :P all in all get it especially when the priced at £15 - £20 , you will get your moneys worth especially if you get into the Champion of Stormfall Mode :-)"
129647782,english,1,424370,"Review after finishing chapter 3 on Offline mode: If you are after a isometric action rpg with tons of loot and skills, you will enjoy this. I had a bloody fantastic time playing the game. I finished the main campaign after around 38 hours. Apart from rewarding game play it comes with excellent production values including the music, voice acting, great sound effects and graphics. (The story is even okay with a nice bit of dark drama in the 3rd chapter). I had absolutely no bugs at all during my time. The game was, gratefully, on the easier side for me, though some bosses (especially the end boss) were set at a hard, though not frustrating, level.  Especially good were the ""hunts"" side quests where you make decisions along the way whether to make rare drop rates increase at the expense of making the enemies harder. They were fun. The game has suffered a lot of early criticism and negativity, I suspect mainly from early players (who suffered with a lot of bugs) and recent players who are heavily into the game+ where maybe things such as drops and skills are causing concerns. I don't know about that yet as I am only going to play game+ for a short while and wait for the final campaign chapter to be released, so I can replay the whole game again (yes it's that good). However if you are happy to play 40 hours of really great action rpg (yes I will say it..... ""Diablo like"") then this game will not disappoint. EDIT; After playing a few hours of the game+ (Stormfall) I am just realising that there is still a ton of game to be played. You are sent on missions that help you restore Stormfell and these missions also get voice acting and new areas to play.  Bosses are now really something to contend with and you will be rethinking your character all over. I love it. There is just so much content here to still be played.  This game definitely deserves more positive reviews than the mixed review status it currently has.  Further edit: Well my review remains completely positive after finishing the chapter IV content. I have now around 100 hours in the game. The final chapter was different in presentation as compared to the first 3 but still enjoyable. The content was less a campaign and more like a series of missions. But it all concluded the story well and I was not disappointed. The cinematic scenes were top quality. You basically just got more of the core gameplay so if you were happy with that so far you will enjoy this. I still have the end game to continue with and I am still motivated enough to continue for the foreseeable future. This game is a solid 8/10 BUT.... it must be played offline. Online is a complete disaster."
88610662,english,1,424370,"I wanted to play this game since release but waited because of the bad state of the game at release.  I'd been wondering when would be the right time to buy it because despite this, in context they ran out of money for their kickstarter.  Far more important to me though was that someone finally made an ARPG which isn't trying to be a straight Diablo or POE clone.  To me, innovation and willingness to be different is huge, especially in what I think is a stale genre which is ready to evolve.  First and foremost, if you're deciding whether to play this game, my advice is to set your expectations as if this were a brand new game for where the content and polish currently is.  Forget that it came out over a year ago now.  It's a very, very fun game IMO, but think of it as a fresh new game that needs time to grow out still.  I've also only been playing single player offline so far.  So...where is it now?  This is the question and the review I'd wanted to read before I bought but couldn't find.  It's hard to read past all the negativity and complaining about the game still.  The great: The action and gameplay in this game feel INCREDIBLE.  This is the biggest thing for me.  I sadly have not been able to get in to POE despite its popularity and vast amount of content because the game just does not feel good to me.  Wolcen feels almost like a hybrid of a brawler and an ARPG.  The hits have weight, weapons have different swings that you actually need to take in to account when using them.  Simply fighting with your regular weapon swings is fun, where as most APRGs it feels like you click enemies to death and ability spam.  I thought the campaign, story, and characters were *very* well written and I'm honestly surprised.  I actually cared about the characters and where the story was going.  The stats, itemization, and skill tree feel like a work in progress but are currently in a very playable and fun state still.  This is another area where I personally am giving it a ton of bonus points because, again, they have opted to not run your boring standard ARPG stat system.  At every level this game is trying to make it so that theoretically every stat can work with any class archetype you choose, and there are not nearly as many arbitrary limits on what gear or skills you can use.  The game pretty much lets you wear and equip whatever you want, the only limitation is whether you can make it work, and the game tries very hard to give you the most flexibility possible in how you accomplish that.  It is so nice to play a game where necessarily intelligence/wisdom = magic, agile = rogue/ranged, etc........even the skill trees themselves offer something for everyone in the majority of cases.  The graphical quality, art style, and animations are superb.  THE BAD, as I see it: -The worst thing for me is that the tooltips are very poorly worded and there are too many unexplained mechanics.  It's kind of bizarre actually, considering how good the writing is for everything else in the game.  It makes it harder to know what you're getting when theorycrafting or comparing items and skills -Everyone writes about bugs with this game.  I played through the campaign two full times and have been doing their endgame mode here for a while.  It's only crashed to desktop twice for me, and once I had to restart the game because it was acting wonky.  Twice I got a weird graphical bug that meant I had to quit to main menu and load again.  That's it. -*I haven't tried it myself yet* but everything I hear is that there are still some game disrupting bugs when playing MP, and at this time there is no matchmaking.    Conclusion: I love this game.  I hope Diablo 4 takes some notes from this game.  I do not say this lightly.  Part of the reason I'd waited on this game, aside from bugs, is that I was afraid that development would freeze or worse the studio would go under.  Instead, they've started posting development updates talking about upcoming content.  They promised regular patches starting in 2021 and thus far have delivered.  They even were able to hire a couple of extra people to work on the game!  I'm not ready to pause on the game yet but I see myself coming back to this game every time there is new content."
64265366,english,1,424370,"I was (and still am hesitant) to write a review for such a controversial game, but, probably 3 people will ever read this, so here goes...  Caveats: Never played an ARPG before. Saw the hype, took a chance on a genre I have no prior experience with.  PLAY OFFLINE:  I hit up offline first without much thought. I had a great gaming experience all the way up and into end game content. Really enjoyed it.  ONLINE: About 9 days after I bought this thing, I decided to try the online mode. Once there, I started to see why all the negative reviews are popping up. This dev team isn't ready for online, is my guess. I got in after a game update or two, so I missed the worst of it. Had some bugs that blocked progress coming into ACT 3, managed to work around them. That said, they shouldn't have been there in the first place.   So IF... this game looks appealing to you, and you like to play alone, buy it, and run offline mode. You will have a blast. Online is better than at release, but I can't see the future, You are on your own if online play is a requirement for you."
140910444,english,1,424370,"So I really like the GFX, the skills, the enemies, the combat. The voice overs are great, campaign is actually a good story - cut scenes are real nice. I haven't played long yet but i come here as a Veteran D2 Player, D3, D4, POE, Etc.  What I like about Wolcen is that it launched as a terrible failure 3 years ago but the team didn't give up. They have been working diligently for free since then. In an age where goliath companies like Blizzard produce over-priced garbage, i believe in the under-dog studio. Wolcen's team is trying REALLY hard to continuously improve this game with free updates and patches. I think if we stick around this will eventually be a top ARPG - it has all the right stuff to reach that level."
49815946,english,0,424370,"I want this game to succeed, but so far that is just not happening. (Please understand before assuming I'm just crapping on the game, I have a lot of time invested into it on several accounts to assist with testing things pretty heavily.)  For those that just want a short answer; I cannot recommend this game currently.  I helped Kickstart this game back when it was still named Umbra. The vision of the game back then was such a different scope than what we have gotten to now, and not in a good way. The developers honestly became extremely lazy mid-development and just decided to start copying every other ARPG on the market rather than stick to their own style and promises. There are so many aspects to why this game is failing currently even though they have now rushed a beta together to try and save-face.   1. The developers pretty much completely ignore the community.  From the start, they had a website/forums where the initial place to report bugs and give feedback was. This started out ok for the first few months of development but slowly you could watch the forum become abandoned by the developers and team of the game. Massive bugs, exploits, glaring issues etc. all started going completely ignored. When I confronted the lead developer about this, he told me ""we don't really bother with the forums anymore, we use the Steam community instead"". Yes, he literally said that. No announcement or anything on the official site, or even just closing it down, they just let people shout into the void with their bug reports and feedback all of which was completely ignored still to this day. (There are massive bugs in this game that to this day still exist that are reported on the original forums.)  Soon after, they started doing the same with the Steam forums, becoming less and less active and less engaged in the community. And again, it turned into a new place to be, Discord. Where they hardly ever talk, and never listen to the feedback.  2. They abandoned their own game in favor of copying other ARPGs.  During the alpha, the game was focused on being a unique experience for an ARPG while still having the traditional aspects you come to expect in one. This was going pretty solid for a while, we got fairly regular updates with some various new features to check out. However, this suddenly changed when massive changes happened in the team where people were fired/laid off to a point where there was only like 2 people left on the team. We got very little information about what was going on and we got a new update that basically broke the entire game for a while.  They shifted focus on their original ideas at this point to basically just stay afloat. The original alpha act 1 was scrapped and was replaced with a very lacking piece of content. Then some new hires were added and more promises began rolling in.   Fast forward to a few months ago, they completely ditched the entire game. They gave up on their own concepts and ideas, and instead completely copied Diablo 3, in almost every possible aspect. They redid everything, but used all of Diablo's ideas instead of being original and having their own game. You logged into this new alpha and were presented with a new title screen copied exactly from Diablo. The entire game mode available at this point was Diablo inspired. Skills, graphics, animations, loot, etc. were all redone to be more like existing ARPGs. The entire skill tree system was disabled in favor of a 'revamp' which turned into a clone of PoE with very minimal unique parts. New mobs were added that were literal copies of Diablo mobs (models look exactly like D3 things (ie the Butcher), the mob skills were clones of things from Diablo, etc.)  3. Massive game breaking bugs still exist, to this day.  There are a lot of massive bugs in this game that have been there since day one. These bugs have been reported multiple times across all mediums (official forums, official bug reporting setup, official Steam community and the official Discord) all of which just got ignored or simply deemed 'unfixable'.   There is a huge bug due to how the world loads because the developers do not understand how to properly handle thread synchronization. This game loads various aspects of the world during a loading screen in different threads. All fine and great for optimization, however they have no locking or syncing mechanisms in place to deal with the order things complete or when the game assumes it's ready. This means there is chance every single time you hit a loading screen that you will fall through the floor.   Here is a quote from one of the developers from a pm I had with on Discord. This was me reiterating the issue of falling through the floors in the game. (This convo was back at the beginning of the year when they released the Diablo 3 clone version of the alpha.)  ""There might be, CryEngine have a worker thread system to run some things away from the main thread. But tbh, we'r a small team and we'r making such an ambitious game (ARPG are hard..... so many game mechanics & systems... it's great and horrible at the same time as a programmer ^^) that I don't think we'll have time to take a look into this before release""  I'm not trying to out a developer or have any ill-will towards them, but this is a huge problem that wasn't new. It's been in the game from the start and is still there now. You can also cause this bug to happen in other ways by running against walls and other jagged surfaces that are blocking like walls. Eventually you will start to slowly fall into the floor, causing the camera to go absolutely insane while moving. Soon enough you'll fall through the floor or your position will never correct itself until you restart the game.  There are other massive bugs like this in the game too. Such as loot drops falling through the floor or landing up in unreachable places. Potions not reacting properly on the current 'tick' of the game, causing you to die because it'll trigger the cooldown but not heal you until the next tick and so on. This are massive glaring problems in an ARPG that are not going to fly when a lot more people start playing and finding the same problems.  ---  I really want this game to succeed. We need more ARPGs to exist and help continue to push the genre forward, but right now Wolcen is not that special thing it once was when they first announced it.   Right now, it feels more like a beta test of an unannounced Diablo 3 clone made by fans.   I do not recommend this game for the time being. I highly recommend people save their money until the Wolcen team really gets back into their own grove and starts making their own game.   To the developer I talked with, I'm sure you'll see my name and recognize me based on our in depth chat. I mean no ill-will towards you or the team. I want this game to be amazing. But for me, your current direction is not one I feel is going to make this game popular or successful outside of a small niche of people. Please take a step back and realize copying Diablo is not how to make a successful ARPG."
78320072,english,0,424370,"This game is a gross far cry of what was originally sold to backers during the Kickstarter. Originally touted as going to be an open world role-playing game with an isometric view, quests out in the world, exploration, and more. A diablo version of Skyrim. Instead we got a buggy b-rate version of Diablo with an edgy story and art that looks like a tryhard-Chinese version of the Warhammer aesthetic. Absolutely embarrassing."
64256373,english,1,424370,"There were definitely some annoying bugs on release, most all of them have been fixed (at least the one I personally encountered) but beyond that its a really fun next gen ARPG."
66703156,english,0,424370,"Wolcen is like a dish that's made with an excellent recipe using the finest ingredients.  The problem is that the dish was taken out of the oven way too soon. Most of the customers left the restaurant after being served a half baked mush and the confused chefs don't know if it's too late to put the food back into the oven.  [h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1] - Gorgeous visuals and decent animations - Environments are detailed, however could use more map variety - Servicable voice acting - Fun combat system - Dynamic class system, which allows your char to respec into anything and change your playtyle while in the city. - Certain skills are a lot of fun. - Story is alright up to Act II.  [h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1] - Act III is horrible - The game is unfinished - No real end content: Item and monster go up to 187 but you pretty much do the same once you beat the story. - End game dungeon modifiers are ridiculously unbalanced: some of them are too easy, while some of them make a run close to unbeatable  - Certain passive skills don't work as intended, and some of them just straight out don't work"
84692086,english,1,424370,"For months I've wanted to buy Wolcen and have put it off because of the negative reviews and general opinion online that it is a buggy mess. I bit the bullet during the winter sale and so far I have been absolutely blown away. It is everything I was looking for in terms of a new ARPG. The combat feels great and the visuals are pretty. The progression systems strike kind of a balance between Diablo 3 and Path of Exile. The abilities are simplified and accessible but there is an expansive passive skill tree for tailoring your build.  In terms of bugs I've gotten some occasional texture pop-in and glitched audio, but everything has been very minor. So far I haven't experienced any of the game breaking issues that other people have reported, but I'll edit my review if I do later. Either way I've already got my money's worth from this game and I would gladly recommend it to other ARPG fans."
63434878,english,1,424370,"I'm a dad, in my 30's now and don't have much time dedicated to gaming. So when I pick a game, I feel I have to choose it wisely. I'm very very glad I purchased this one. First steam review I've ever done. One of my favorites is Grim Dawn. This is now equal to that and I've only played the first couple of hours.   The graphics, diversity of spells, spell graphics (important to me) and the way the combat feels/looks is just perfect. Really great job, devs. I'm gonna spend a ton of my free time on this one!  EDIT: You absolutely should not purchase this game as of 2.19.2020.  It's important to know that this game is not in a playable/enjoyable state at the moment. My initial review was based on open beta game play after 3 hours. Once launched, the game was quickly taken offline for 3 days due to unexpected database issues due to a massive influx of new players. There are so many bugs that many consider game breaking and it's flat not worth $40.   Bugs that you will encounter as of this review: Loot/Stash disappearing, Item/gold duplication, unable to basic attack certain mobs, end game monsters not dropping any loot, damage modifiers not actually modifying any damage, potential for complete character wipe and completely bricking your game open completing final act boss.   *Before you purchase, please go to the /r/Wolcen subreddit on Reddit and look up the current state of the game. You've been warned. Come back a year from now and I'm sure the game will be great."
57229570,english,1,424370,"[i] DISCLAIMER [/i]: I backed this game back in 2015, played here and there during it's changes, I liked some of the changes and didn't like others. This game is much different in 2019 than it was then, and most of the negative reviews are based on that. As you can see I'm approaching 200hrs played in early access, and I might just hit that mark before release because of how enjoyable I have found the game, especially the recent patches. I'll layout my pros and cons for what is currently available and then my optimism for what is coming.  [h1] Pros [/h1] -[u] Visceral action: [/u] This is an ARPG, and you want to feel the impact of your skills when killing enemies, and I feel Wolcen does a very good job here. I've mostly been playing melee and ranged builds, haven't really dabbled in magic yet, but the attacking skills are hefty and satisfying. I'll also add that the audio for the skills is great, and I particularly love the ""plug plug plug"" sound of the auto-turrets.  -[u] Itemization: [/u] Loot, loot and more loot! What more can you want from a hack and slash looter? Starting out lvl 1 in the campaign each found item is a treasure, wondering if it's an item that fits into what you are planning to play or you find something that completely alters your plan because it's better or build defining in this classless system. Once you start finding rares and uniques the game really kicks up! But once you start finding legendaries, oh boy do the min-maxing demons come out, and I love em'!!! So far in this iteration of the game these red items, basically rares on steroids, are often best in slot, and the grind to get them is a ton of fun. Anything red that drops on the screen is a potential small to huge upgrade for your character or another build, and then sometimes; but as with any game looter, there's the chance that item just rolled all the wrong affixes and is useless.   -[u] Skills: [/u] I mentioned above how I felt the skills are visceral, and you feel their impact. Here I would just like to mention that I feel the current group of skills we have access to (24 in total) are pretty darn good. The animations and artwork of the skills is great, and I do love the rune system that is in place. For those who are reading this review having not yet played the game, so far each skill lvls up to 20 (same as current level cap) and you have 20 points to allocate between the associated runes for the skill. Some runes cost 4 points (minor) and some cost 8 (major), and this will determine how you use the skill compared to another player using the same skill. It's fun and allows for a lot of build variation.  -[u]Passive Tree: [/u] The Tree has 3 rings (2 at the moment) in the first ring there are your basic ""class archetypes""; soldier, sentinel (rogue) and a mage one (forgot the name). The next ring has 6 ""sub classes"" and these are where you start to get builds being defined. The 6 branches of the second ring are the: Assassin (dodging, single target dmg), Ranger (projectiles and ranged attacks), Elementalist? (elemental damage duh), Cabalist (damage over time oriented), Warmonger (physical damage), alongside the Praetorian (tanky boi). Now the really cool thing about these rings is that they are not stationary, so you aren't stuck going in one path or needing to spend 10 points just to get to your desired 2nd ring, you can rotate the rings to set them up the most efficient way for your build!   -[u] Attributes: [/u] You gain attribute points per lvl that can be put into Ferocity, Toughness, Agility and Wisdom. You will find yourself sometimes doing a little mixing and matching to perhaps hit break points, or your build might only require you to dump all points into one. It's dealer’s choice sometimes and is often very dependent on gear you find and certain passives you may have chosen. Wolcen is finding a nice happy, and functional medium blending attributes, passives and itemization together.   -[u] Campaign [/u]: I found the first act to be rat her enjoyable, and the story to be easy to follow and so far, well thought out. The art and environments are great. Not the open world that the game used to have, but I do not find it detracts from the gameplay that much. Looking forward to Acts 2 and 3 on launch (hope they have a bit more content than Act 1), and the following Acts that are to be FREE DLC.   -[u] Soldier of Fortune and Wrath of Sarisel: [/u] So these are the current endgame content for the game. [b] Soldier of fortune [/b] you get to push higher and higher monster levels with the incentive of increased loot drop quality and quantity. You can add modifiers to these runs to make it more difficult but increase the reward. in SoF loot drops from everything, but you don't get the ""reward"" until you've completed 5 runs.  For [b] Wrath of Sarisel [/b], when making an SoF run, once you add all the modifiers you can lure ""tainted"" monsters that will chase you down and do what they can to kill you. These guys are basically assassins that can really mess you up. These runs are a mix of speed and kill runs, as you want to clear mobs as quickly as possible to kill the bosses so you can get a high rank at the end of the run, I believe that the higher the rank the better the loot (doesn't always seem to be the case). However, these runs offer loot that doesn't drop elsewhere. Loot from these runs can roll affixes like a Bow allowing you to use the melee oriented Bladestorm (Whirlwind). This affix might be cool and interesting, but maybe not useful. But finding a shield or a sword that allows you to use spell casting skills as a melee character can be build RE-defining.   -[u] Social/Trading: [/u] The big thing though is you can trade anything and everything with your friends. Even if you found something while playing solo, you can give that to your buddy who is just starting out. I don't mind a system like this, I prefer it over nothing, or something so limited its frustrating (D3 trading...blech).  [h1] Cons [/h1] -[u] Skills: [/u] some skills I found we very slow to cast, like Arrows Wail, which is hail of arrows type skill, and the casting time for the skill seems a bit long as enemies tend to be able to close the gap during the cast time. This may just be due to my lack of play time with the skill and build style as I've mostly been playing melee builds. So, take that with a grain of salt.   -[u] Lag and Loading: [/u] Right now Wolcen seems to be pretty CPU intensive, generally once in-game it isn't too bad, but sometimes when starting a run or going to the next level it takes too long and some monsters show up and slowly start beating on me to the point I end dying at the start.  -[u] Bugs: [/u] It is early access, there are bug. My review is very long now so go look in the forums for the bugs.   [h1] Future Content: [/h1]  For this I would really suggest going to their website ([url=store.steampowered.com] https://wolcengame.com/ [/url] to see what they have planned as I have gone on quite a bit so far and I would just be copy-pasta-ing everything anyway.  If you like Hack and Slash ARPGs the likes of Diablo, you can find enjoyment here. I'd recommend picking it up if it goes on sale before release (January 2020 if they are still on track!), if it doesn't then maybe just wait until it is released if you don't feel like being limited to lvl 20 (lvl 90 is the cap on release).  Current state, I give this early access version a 7/10. Again, I'm giving this a 7/10 as an early access game. I'm not giving a fully developed and launched game a 7/10 because that is not what that is...sometimes people seriously forget that when reviewing or reading reviews of early access games. I hope to update this on release, and I hope I can give the fully released version of Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem a 7/10 or better!  Thank you for your time, Flyhumpy"
123608486,english,0,424370,"2,5 years after release and still no minute gameplay without multiple bugs. feels even more bugged then at release. to just name a few in online solo and online group play:  - npcs blocking the way in campain, no progress possible (sometimes aether jump can help) - random game crashes - random party/group crashes - clicking in UI windows will move you character to the location behind (as if there would be no UI window) -> especially fun when you want to trade and move away instead -> this bug is present since release! - mouse wheel often not working to scroll down at vendor lists - cutscenes not loading - sometimes loading times up to a minute for new campain areas - tooltips closing when another party member changes his gear (wtf) - invisible items in inventory (several restarts needed to fix this) - items cannot be equiped in any gear slot (several restarts needed to fix this) - items sometimes drop without names - new party members stuck on town portal - enemys getting stuck on corners - stash often not usable at all (yes seems to be known since over a week) - wrong tooltip damage (e.g. minion tooltip dps scaling with wrong dmg types) - graphical bugs (black boxes over enemies) - enemies glitching through the map - quest markers randomly disappering - sometimes equipment disapears after logout - sound bugs with overlaying never ending sounds   and there are still many annoying game mechanics - left mouse will always move/attack (nothing else can be bind to left mouse) - character does not move straight to target locations, it always try to find a path to that location - you have to choose/select a reward even if there is just 1 item you get - npc companions blocks your range attacks - loot disappears a second after drop and connot be picked up automatically - u have pets, but they are useless - u can transform into a huge cool looking beeing, that does no dmg but hase some great fx - boring skill runes (16 runes per skill and a lot of them are just + %dmg) - bad ai of summons and the most of them can not be given commands  pros: - has some nice visual effects - some fx/explosions have some satisfying sound too - rage and willpower system and not simply mana - passive tree is not to simple and not to complex - easy/cheap to respec -> you can start playing without searching/creating a build before in a third party programm - you can loot, lvl up, gear up, craft, ""play"" with friends - some bugs can be fun too  sadly it is still more frustrating then fun to play"
168131604,english,0,424370,I understand abandoning a project. But not allowing your players to enjoy multiplayer? Peer to Peer or releasing a server API. Instead just nothing. Big lol.
172377285,english,1,424370,"I have a little history with Wolcen ,i tried it a few years ago and my computer had some problems,here on steam this is my second experience with this game.   Unfortunately my review comes at a time when developpers announced their plan to end the support for multiplayer and endgame content however there's enough content in the single player campaign and to be honest i was interested only in that. The after grind is not for me and there are better alternatives for that.  If you never heard of this game there are similar games like Path of Exiles or Diablo series,this can be a great choice if you're interested in action rpgs with dungeon crawling and loot-based progression.  I really liked the dark fantasy theme and visually the game is a feast for the eyes and for my surprise the voice acting was great for this kind of game. After some browsing i discovered popular voice actors from games i played before like dragon age or witcher 3.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311461899  In terms of gameplay everything was smooth with no major issues or bugs.. the movement was fluid and the dodge/roll responsive. With a huge arsenal of spells and combinations of talent trees you can create a unique character, featuring a classless system Wolcen doesn't lock you into a specific class !   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311376207  Another mechanic i enjoyed was the Apocalyptic Form, this transforms you into avatars with unique and powerful abilities ,there are multiple avatars you can unlock each with its own theme. Beyond the cool factor and amazing visuals there are strategic advantages during though battles or boss fights.  At this point in time i can only recommend this if you're looking for the single player content, for a great price during a sale of course.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311467285  Pros: - Great story with twists and betrayals - Voice acting  - Visuals  Cons: - If you want more than single player campaign,read the negative reviews  My review score  Story - 9 Gameplay- 8  Graphics- 8 Sound - 9  Overall - 8.5"
63504300,english,0,424370,"Right now the game just feels unpolished and I cant tell if its because of the servers being under strain and things feel laggy or its just the way the game is but combat often feels unresponsive and choppy, attacks dont connect the way you expect them to not to mention the unit collision can make things super frustrating at times.   There is also a problem of skills not giving you enough information about what they actually do and how they scale and all the information given is usually very vague such as ""increases damage dealt by summons"" but it doesnt give you a number and from what I can tell you cant see it in the stats of the summons either. Status ailments are also hard to keep track of since there is no indicator on an enemy telling you what they are afflicted by and how many stacks youve put on them and similar things happen all over the game with things being very obscured and unclear for no real reason.  Last of all is just a personal complaint since I am going for a summoner build but the AI for the summons is ridiculously bad 70% of the time they just sit behind me and do nothing, the charge command for the zombie summons rarely ever work they either get stuck on you, each other, the terrain or on thin air. there is also nothing in the game that tells you if your summons scale of things like youre status ailment chance or if they calculate their own stats separately from yours. You also completely lack any form of indicator of how many summons you currently have so you have to manually keep track of them at all times which feels like a huge step backwards from every other ARPG ive played.   TLDR: I do enjoy the build diversity and experimentation the game offers you but I can not recommend it as it is now because the unresponsive and unreliable combat system holds it back.  Edit: There are alot of really butthurt people commenting on this review deciding to ignore the fact that the game is getting more and more negative reviews by the hour and that the game is not flawless and that alot of the problems are personal opinion and thoughts. Neither am I attacking or discrediting the devs in any way and I know they are working to improve the game but that doesnt mean i will recommend the game until these issues are addressed."
65543844,english,0,424370,"Update: I have re-downloaded the game as of August 7th ([u]after 5 months[/u]) and here are some of the things i noticed.  [b]Bugs, bugs, and more bugs.[/b]  I started a new character to see what has changed.... 1. The server capacity is only at 1k now, so anytime it goes over the limit, the server will shut down.(yes wolcen lost 98% of the player base, so they downgraded their servers to the limit before release.) This is what happens with a bad launch, or releasing a game that was not ready. When will gaming companies learn? First impressions matter and you can't redeem yourself after a bad launch. 2. As i played through the beginning of act one again, there was an audio bug of squishy corpse noises that wouldn't stop playing and it was annoying as hell to the point where i had to go to settings and turn the effects volume off. 3. Things disappeared in the chests. 4. Offline character randomly deleted. 5. I still sometimes get stuck in objects, but not as often as i did before. 6. Playing as a ranged character, the hit boxes are still janky or sometimes it doesn't register. 7. I got stuck in a loading screen for 10 minutes after ACT 1 transitioning to ACT 2. 8. There is still some latency issues here and there, but it definitely was not as bad as before. 9. I wasn't able to test online because i couldn't find anyone online to play with... everyones gone, what do you expect. But last i played the LAG was BAD. 10. While going through act one, sometimes the quests don't register and i got stuck in a map and had to go through the other maps again for the quests to register correctly.  WILL UPDATE AS I PROGRESS FURTHER OR FIND NEW PROBLEMS.  [b]SKILLS AND BALANCE[/b]   Will update when i'm higher level.   [b]Armor and Weapons[/b]  1. Legendaries are still useless... 2. Seems as if armor doesn't make as much of an impact as your passive skill tree.  Will update more as i progress.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This game lost 127k players within the first month of release. That should tell you how terrible the developers are at making decisions. They make decisions to satisfy them and not the player base. They do not listen to feedback and usually deletes them.  If you even look closer, the people who have the top reviews didn't continue playing after they reviewed. Because after the game released, the first patch destroyed the game, the second patch nerfed skills and took ALL players hard earned money away whether you were a cheater or not, (because they couldn't catch who did or did not cheat), which caused mass amount of players to quit since they lost their hours upon hours of grinded money.   The last time i played wolcen was a few weeks ago, ever since they've completely nerfed everything, and haven't balanced the skills, the game has become unplayable. They'll keep nerfing skills people find a good build on to help clear the maps faster.  The game itself was already very grindy if you didn't cheat, but now they've nerfed all skills and made the required materials to upgrade items 2 - 4 times more is just ridiculous.   I just wanted a game where i could enjoy hack and slashing mindlessly and enjoy the loot drops, but rare loot drops are almost non-existent at this point because of the nerfing.   If diablo lets players 1 hit everything and clear through the map fast and enjoy their way of grinding, why can't the developers of Wolcen do it? The answer is, they don't want players to have fun.   The result: they've lost 95% of the player base as of today. You will not find anyone to be able to play with because majority of the people has quit. Personally, I'm not going to go back and waste my time on the game anymore till a year later when they've finally fixed the game.   Wolcen studio, here's an advice: to keep your player base, LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR WISHES. Don't DELETE US AND BAN US FROM DISCORD BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE OUR SUGGESTIONS.  I wouldn't be surprised if their servers are not up anymore in a month or two. Wolcen studio has destroyed themselves and the player base. Do not support them and give them your money. Who ever is making all the decisions in this game should be fucking fired."
70830944,english,0,424370,"Great looking game, great feeling game.  The issue I had is that the game provides you barely any numbers for your spells and abilities.  Descriptions such as ""Your attacks may cause lightning to chain foes""  No proc chance, no damage number for the lightning, just fucking guess.  So I thought, you know what they got a great game here, fun to play, they just gotta fill in some blanks.  Was I dead wrong!!! They are making an expansion!?!?!?!  They didn't even give you fucking spell descriptions yet, and they have the godamned nerve to make an expansion!?  WTF is wrong with these people.  Pro tip, some player love to know what their characters abilities do, we don't need act 4 to this mess, just fix your game please!!!!"
97110792,english,0,424370,"TLDR: Wolcen at this current point in time is still half baked. They have made good progress since launch, but it still has a very long way to go. As of right now, endgame is bugged and the story is not finished yet, and due to this i cannot recommend this game. THIS DOES NOT MEAN, I WANT THE DEVS TO GIVE UP.  I want to love this game. The foundations that the devs have laid are quite solid. Skills are fun to use, changing builds is super easy, the transmog system and dye system is super easy and you can always keep yourself looking good, and the endgame systems they have set up promise a good time.   Thats the problem though, the games foundations are solid, and the ideas are good, but there are too many bugs and issues holding the game back. During my play through (most of which was done co-op with a friend), we experienced a couple of bugs through the story, one of which forced us to replay an entire section (thankfully an earlier section) because his character did not get the completion flag to trigger on his account.  Another bug we encountered that was VERY annoying, was in chapter 3. we were experiencing a really weird bug where our characters and animations were all moving/playing in full speed, but it was as if our characters were getting stuck in the floor and the game was having a hard time trying to figure out where we were, thus forcing us to move in super slow motion, EVEN WHEN NO ENEMIES COULD POSSIBLY BE DEBUFFING US.  Then we have the issues with endgame, currently there is a huge bug where if you are in a mandate OR expedition, sometimes when you open your inventory, skill screen, or passive screen, it boots you out of the mandate/expedition completely and kills the portal, completely resetting your progress. It is completely random WHICH screen does it when it decides to happen, but it happens frequently enough that i have only been able to complete 3 mandates and 2 expeditions.  I have also encountered bugs in expeditions that render the boss immune to all sources of damage, hits simply not registering at all. I know this is a bug, as the boss was not IN a damage immune phase. no numbers were even popping up, yet their model was flashing as though it was getting hit and my internet connection was perfectly fine. (on top of that, i was able to fully recreate the issue in offline mode where internet is a non-issue)  Then we have the story. The story just started to get interesting in chapter 3, annnnnd it ends on a cliffhanger.   Due to all of the issues stated above, i cannot recommend this game to anyone quite yet. I ABSOLUTELY DO ACKNOWLEDGE that the dev team has made progress, good progress, but its not done yet, and i do hope that they continue to improve upon, and expand what they have.  I want this game to succeed, as stated in the beginning, i love all of the ideas they have, its just not ready yet."
67819670,english,0,424370,"I have spent 465 hours on game and I feel like I am in position to let you know if you should buy it or not.  Short answer - Do not buy it!  The lack of communication from these developers is outstanding. We dont know the roadmaps, nor what is being fixed or worked on. They seem to neglect priority of fixing servers completely which are very broken and dsyfunctional for multiplayer experience.  The neglect is very obvious even in their own discord channels which are being polluted by dupers and real $ sellers. And they really dont do anything about it. (And on funny note after helping and twitching for their community they banned me without a reason).  The dupping in wolcen is disaster. To this day nothing has been done. But can you blame dupers not really... The whole crafting system as one friend put it to me, is worse then winning a national lottery. Without dupers selling gears you would never be able to craft perfect or close to perfect gears. The whole crafting system is one massive joke.  The game is alpha state there is very little content to do apart of experimenting with builds and griding level 90. In order to reach level 90 you would need to spend around a year in game, its worse then grinding in MMO.  I could go on but just take a look at bug reporting section or jump on discords and you will see how the game has failed the community and declining very fast.  The only good thing was the story and single player experience till you finish it but its not worth the price they ask, nor your time. Just wait for diablo. These guys made something unique but they executed on it poorly. They dont know how to manage community nor they know how to run servers."
186158338,english,0,424370,Developer couldn't complete this game and abandoned it. Just becasue they released it and called it 1.0 doesnt at all mean it was. Then very shortly after announce another arpg. Took customers money and threw them away. Don't fall for it again.
32153912,english,1,424370,"So....I had originally given this game a poor review but after sinking some more time into it I have begun to really really be excited about it.   Realize that if you get the game now there isnt too much content. That is the one thing I would want to impress on anyone thinking of getting the game now. It is still early access.  ~~~AS OF NOW~~~ ~~~~~THE GOOD~~~~~ I am in love with the skill set of a few of the characters. The POE-like style of the skill tree is fantastic...but unlike POE you dont have to follow a straight line with it. There are very few restrictions in terms of where you can go. Keeping in mind that there are only half of the tree available at this point and a lvl 20 cap I am pretty hyped about what else I can do in the game.  The skill graphics are dazzling. I dont use that word very often but I will in this case. I am really enjoying the way it is all put together and having a ton of fun grinding already.   It seems to be getting updated and patched regularly.   I really think this will give POE and D3 a run for their money and Im happy I found it early on to see how it gets develped over time.   ~~~~~THE NOT SO GOOD~~~~~ Content. I really wish there was more to do in the game. Ive been grinding away at capped level hunting for really mediocre gear (the usual progression of white gear, blue gear, yellow gear) and it seems that yellow gear is as high as its gotten. I suppose this isnt as much a complaint as it is a desire for more.  Bugs. The game crashes for me occasionally and has quite a few random movement bugs. It is a little clunky in a few ways but again...it is early access and is to be somewhat expected at this stage.  ~~~~~IN THE END~~~~~ Would I recommend you get this. Yes. I would not expect a very polished game though. If you want to get into a great game early and see it all come together over time...this is it.  I am really excited to see what becomes of this game and look forward to some sleepless nights~"
63701725,english,0,424370,"passive nodes that don't work, passive nodes that are overtuned, stashes and characters disappearing, and all the server downtime, but what are the devs' top priority?  Banning everyone who duped gold using a bug that was reported YEARS ago.  The attributes nerf coming out of the claimed ""beta"", cause let's face it this game is still in beta, is just one of the many unbelievable things this release botched. Defensives removed, leveling makes you weaker, and adding attributes tops off what you are focusing on (crit, att speed< ailment chance or hp/shield), but weakens the rest? What?  Apparently game is as playable as it was 4-5 years ago, and they spent this time transferring it to another engine and rewriting some code so it fit the engine, and no progress was made in making the game actually work. Then again, this sounds so absurd so do your own research about this if it makes or breaks your purchase.  The game looks fun and plays quite well at the starting stages and despite alot of build whining online you can make any build work all the way to the end of the campaign, because killing bosses is really learning their mechanics more than a dps race  before the reality kicks in that your build is worthless in endgame (yes i played lightning mage and later found out more than half my nodes, mostly the spell damage ones, do not work)  Oh, and did i mention that certain endgame mechanics (i.e the Dark Market) bricks your game?   Story is what you would expect out of an ARPG, something demons/devils, something angels, character is blessed/cursed and is called to action etc etc.  You will have fun for the first few hours, in awe of the graphics and the unique rotating skill tree. If you are willing to spend the game's full price (34 SGD for me) for ""a few hours of fun"", then go for it.   Otherwise, dont even look at this game. I heard Grim Dawn is on sale."
73283758,english,0,424370,"I've Been Tricked, I've Been Backstabbed and I've Been Quite Possibly, Bamboozled!  C'mon WOLCEN Studios, it's 2020, man. You guys know better than to do this to us. We're so hungry for a good ARPG, and to not be able to make this pre-beta game actually full release quality after 5 months post-launch, and AFTER you've already taken our money is an absolute disgrace. ""But we're working hard to fix the bugs!"", yeah, we get it. But that's what closed alpha/ beta tests are for, to get the bugs worked out...instead, we unwittingly paid you a whopping $39.99 to beta test your game. Launches like this, and dodgy attempts at quelling the outrage with empty promises of patches and content really make me miss the good old days of buying a physical game at a store. It was a tangible summation of painstaking hours of coding and testing that was crisp, clean, and very rarely had game-breaking bugs. Developers tested the hell out of their product to deliver something to the gaming population that they were proud of. WOLCEN Studios, what do you have to be proud of with this game?"
64627880,english,0,424370,"So 200+ hours into the game, and  to be honest I hate writing reviews, but I can't keep my frustration at bay any longer. It has all been said before. The game is utterly broken with all the bugs. Some of the bugs I don't mind but for me the crazy frustration are things like backtracking through an entire map just to kill the last rat and then go ALL the way through the entire map to kill the boss. Not a bug, just an insanely hair ripping experience. Did they fix the life regeneration of bosses in 1.08. NO they didn't, welcome to another boss that instantly heal destroying the run. Most of the time when you get one shotted you will have no idea where it comes from, and it will happen often on higher levels unless you are crazy geared, or using some broken skills/exploits. The game is not optimized for dodging and many times you have no chance to avoid the attacks, dying while you panic press the button that suppose to save you. I play offline on a very good gaming rig and yet I die over and over again to retarded programming, it is beyond frustrating. Planning to do a lot of crafting, well not in Wolcen. The crafting materials are the most uncommon items in the game, and even with help from the marked you will chew through your very small stack of materials in mere seconds most likely not getting what you want. I do love the game, because it could have been so good, and yet they choose to put a beta on the marked most likely due to financial reasons, and yes it was a smart decision money wise, because people were hungry for a new hack & slash and bought the unfinished product but it could have been so much better. On one side I hope they will get it all fixed in time, but on the other side I also hope they take the money and retire so I can uninstall this @#@# from my hard drive, especially since I don't have any hair left."
142638044,english,1,424370,"Thoroughly enjoyed this. I was playing this concurrently with Diablo 4 and found myself playing this more. I played as a sorcerer in offline mode and nothing felt like a grind as it does in D4. Combat is fun and the spells have decent variety. I had the most fun with 3 summons and an OP annihilation beam.   You can pause the game unlike D4, which is super handy as i have a toddler running around and i can simply resume where i was without getting killed or logged off. All in all i am satisfied and will replay this. It was an absolute steal for only 10 dollars.  in comparison I paid 150$ for D4 ultimate edition and am mostly disappointed, i should have just watched the cut scenes online and called it a day."
179202736,english,0,424370,Not even the will to offer local co:op or dedicated servers to play with friends. They just shutdown the servers and ripped money from alot of people which bought a online co:op game to enjoy. Thanks for the Scam.
45904456,english,1,424370,"As you may have noticed, this is a very polarizing game. By buying it, you have access to an early version of the game. You want an full-fledged experience right at this moment? Then don't buy it now. You want to support a possibly great game and provide feedback? Then go for it. The devs have taken the risky steps to recreate almost entirely the underlying systems that define the game (every dev dreams of this) and from what I have seen during the (short, technical) beta, it paid out. The game looks sharper, the gameplay way more responsive and this is a very good base to build content on.  Now do I recommend this game? This is clearly too soon to say. Diablo 3 was looking pretty good during beta and see where it is now. There are many game design choices that can kill a game beyond just core gameplay. We have no idea how loot or build dynamics will play out in the endgame, or the amount of content we'll have. And we will probably not know until late in beta or after release.  I'm leaving a positive review (for now) and I urge you to ignore trolls who still don't undertand what Early Access is meant to be. Now to WOLCEN Studio, don't disappoint ;)"
75628623,english,0,424370,"As a primarily ARPG player coming from Grim Dawn and Diablo 3 , I will try to review this game on it's ARPG parameters equivalent.  Graphics : Hand's down the best in any ARPG. Graphics are extremely beautiful. Locations are varied but very linear, similar to Diablo 3.  Core Gameplay : Now , the skills we use in this game are similar to Orbs from Path of Exile (POE) , called Enneracts in this game. This skills have their own modifiers when you level up however some of the modifiers are pretty bland and boring.  Modifiers such as ""Increased damage"" or ""Increased critical hit chance"" adds no variety at all. Such modifiers should come with unique weapons rather than an modifier upgrade itself. Right now the meta is ailment stacking and almost everyone runs this play style for maximum damage.  UI : UI is pretty standard ; however translation and description of skills could be better. It is extremely confusing to know which skill scales with either attack or casting speed.  Combat : Fast and engaging , stylish and satisfying.  Character building and development :  There are no fixed classes so you can play a hybrid of pretty much anything ; This is detrimental to the long term success of the game BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS DEEP AS PATH OF EXILE. There is really no variety in class building / theorycrafting in this game. Veteran ARPG players likes to spend an hour or so to theory craft their builds but this is not possible. Also, if you intend on playing a summoner build , hold off for now because SUMMONS DO NOT SCALE WITH ANY IN-GAME PLAYER GEAR ; there is only 1 unique item which increases their damage and that's about it. The Gates of Fate ( Similar to Path of Exile's Skill Tree) is not expansive enough. Re-spec in this game is really , really cheap so I don't see a point in starting another character.  Storyline : It's the best in any ARPG and the cinematics are top-notch.  Itemization : Itemization is good but can be better, There are no set items in this game. It is pretty much a tried tested and proven Diablo 3 where you insert various gems in your weapon and armor slots. You can however re-roll the type of sockets and rolls on your items with certain end-game materials.  End-game : Copy and pasted from Diablo 3 rift dungeons. , At the end of the dungeon , you get loot and that's about it. Atleast in Diablo 3, you get to upgrade your gems but there isn't any legendary gem socketing in this game. You unlock the ""Champion of Stormfall mode"" , where you send out mercenaries to do missions and the only way to complete the timer is for you to do dungeon runs. So it becomes an insane , insane dungeon farming loop and it's similar to Diablo 3 , POE and Grim Dawn.   Bugs : I did ran into gamebreaking bugs that needed me to restart this game ; this is totally unacceptable as this game has been out for 6 months or so. Bugs included : Unable to move on to the next location and not able to teleport back to town. I experienced one game crash.   Final verdict : 5/10 , get it on sale or discount. This game will be at it's best in another year or so. There is a huge issue within the community regarding some of the features advertised during it's early access and was not implemented during release , and when you consider this game has been in early access for FIVE YEARS , they should have done better. It's a cash and grab in my honest opinion. Wolcen has a long , long way to go if they want to challenge Grim Dawn , POE , Diablo 3 , Torchlight 2 and even Last Epoch. You're better off spending money on Chronicon / Grim Dawn if you love ARPG's."
95337898,english,0,424370,"Imagine ordering a pizza from a new place. Some time later a  manager calls you and tells you, that a pizza will be delivered a bit later, as they are overworked. No problem, you guess, things happen. So you wait. Finally, delivery guy comes with your order. The pizza box looks kinda nice from the ourside, exept for a few small dents.  Then, you open the box, and inside of it you find a [i]doughy, slimy thing of a roughly circular shape[/i].

101719096,english,1,424370,"I avoided this game up until a few weeks ago (when it went on one of its sales) because of the mixed reviews. I was craving an arpg, but felt like I played most of those that I wanted. I noticed the the reviews were still mixed but going up since the release and looked into it more as the devs seemed to be still active and trying to turn the game around. I decided to take the leap, and honestly, I'm glad I did. Although this is definitely not the best arpg I've played, I had a good time playing through the story and currently doing a little end game content. That being said there are definitely some criticisms, but it does appear that the devs are keen on fixing most of the issues I have in future patches. Even with only having a fun time going through the story, I played around 30-40 hours, which alone was good enough to justify the 20 something dollars I paid, although maybe not full price. Here are the list of positives and negatives for me:  Positives: -Best graphics in an arpg so far -Combat is satisfying and and fun -Story I thought was pretty good and kept me interested (people are mad about the ending, but I don't mind the cliff-hanger knowing they plan on adding it later especially when I got a lot out of what was already there) -I like the passive talent trees -I also like that you can customize each skill to fit different builds  Negative: -I wish there were more skills available. I was a little disappointed with the limited selection despite how customizable they are. A part of me was also disappointed that you can basically get all the active skills you will use for the rest of the game really early, as you can just buy them. -Uninteresting gear. I've had a few legendary and unique pieces of armor and weapons so far, but none of them were really that interesting, just better stats than the other gear, with sometimes a small twist on something with the unique armor. I would really like to see this area fleshed out more in future patches. -Although I'm enjoying the end game so far, I can definitely see it getting stale in the near future (particularly with no really interesting gear to ""switch things up"").  Neutral: -I know another gripe of people were glitches in the game. I know this will vary between systems, but I had only 3 glitches that I noticed, one of which was a crash. The other two were minor. It seems like they did a great job cleaning them up, at least from my experience. -Kind of mixed on having the skills completely determined by the weapon. I wanted to make a pally type character only to realize I couldn't use some of the skills I wanted to do (although I did google and find out there is one shield that allows spells with a shield, but it still kind of bugged me). I also had a rogue character that I feel would be perfect with 1 or 2 of the spells, but can't unless I don't duel wield daggers (have to do one dagger with a catalyst in the other hand), which makes it feel like it isn't the rogue anymore.  -No Act 4. Currently, the story leaves you on a cliff-hanger as I mentioned. I don't find it necessarily a bad thing as I it makes me want to stick around to see what happens. That being said I understand people's point that it is a full game and it should have already been in it.  Overall, it was definitely worth the price I paid ($24 I think) (on the fence at full price). It has its issues, but the devs seem active and I hope they truly make this into an even better game."
91562161,english,1,424370,"So, I managed to beat this thing.  I should probably note my perspective on this is perhaps a little unusual, because I NEVER knew of the kickstarter. All I knew going in was the game had a rough launch, but had been getting patches and updates, until I saw it on sale sometime after Bloodtrail came out and though ""Hey, why not?"" So a lot of the controversy around this game I was mostly unaware of.  So coming into this somewhat blind and well after the fact? What's here is not half bad. It's basically Path of Diablo 3, taking clear influences from both games. Like Diablo 3 you've got highly modifiable skills, but a giant passive skill tree like Path of Exile etc.  That said the game manages to put a few of it's own twists on things. The skill tree for example, can have parts of it rotated, Want to use nodes form opposite ends of the tree? No need to use a bunch of skill points to path across, just move the tree a bit so the parts you want are closer together. In fact I'd argue flexibility in character building is this game's greatest strength. most passive skills in this game cover broad categories, think ""any elemental damage"" or ""any physical damage"" rather than ""fireball"" or ""swords"" so for whatever build you've got going, there's probably a few different skills that will work with it, and since skills learn abilities that change their damage type, skills that generally wouldn't fit a build can be MADE to do so. Elemental affliction on a melee fighter? Sure, why not?  The biggest drawbacks I can think of, controversy aside, is the game is short. I beat it in about 15 hours, I was skipping most of the little side dungeons, but really there's not much in the way of side content here. There is an endgame called Champion of Stormfall which looks decently involved, though I haven't dabbled in it much as of this writing.  While the game has a reputation for bugs, I haven't really encountered many in my playthrough. mostly it was texture pop in and maybe some animation issues early on, odd, but nothing show-stopping. The devs HAVE been patching since launch, though people keep saying it's buggy, so I'm not sure if those reviews are simply outdated or if this is a ""it works on my PC""(tm) thing.  Finally i'll note for better or worse this game is VERY edgelord in presentation. It looks like the devs played some Warhammer, saw everyone's massive shoulders and said ""here, hold my beer."" whether that's annoying, awesome or both is up to individual preference.  So... yeah, overall, not bad! I maybe wouldn't say to rush and buy it now because this thing had a rough history and there's plenty of solid looter-rpgs out there without that hanging over its head. but if you don't care about that or are feeling curious? By all means give it a shot, you might be surprised."
131164238,english,0,424370,"Because of the new update I decided to give the game another chance. Turns out it remains incredibly frustrating and I really can't recommend the game to anyone.  First of all, the game lags throughout. Even with a very low ping this is very noticeable. It takes up to five seconds between clicking on the merchant and opening the menu. With a ping of 30.  The lag is also clearly noticeable in combat, especially when using a healing potion. In the HUD, you can clearly see how the empty life bar is filled, then falls back to its original state for a fraction of a second, only to be filled again. It's so much fun when a fatal hit kills you thanks to this lag.  Speaking of death, once you die, you have three respawns. Resurrecting is only allowed for a short period of time and the game always respawns you at your corpse. Once you revive, you are immediately vulnerable to damage again. This can (and will!) lead to you being revived in a poisonous cloud and dying again immediately.  The game has no animation cancelling. Short explanation what animation cancelling means: If you are in an animation (e.g. casting a spell), but then suddenly want to dodge an attack, the spell is canceled and the character dodges. This function does not exist in the game. Meaning  that every animation, no matter how small and unimportant, is played to the end before a new input by the player is accepted. There are constantly situations in battles where the game tells you that you should dodge an attack, but you can't because you're already casting a spell or your character has to finish his walking animation first.  In the end, the game feels extremely laggy and unresponsive.  After almost three years we finally have the last chapter of the story (lol). Of course, at this point I have no idea what it was about and just skipped through the dialogs. I just dont care anymore. So i cant review the story But looks visually nice, like the rest of the game.  The gameplay of the last chapter, however, I can review. And it is a disaster. There is hardly any pure story gameplay compared to the other chapters. Instead, the mechanics of the previous endgame have been reworked to stretch out the gameplay of the last chapter as long as possible. Instead of going from area to area like in the previous chapters (and all other diablo likes games). You now have to research the next story mission on a map. To advance this research you now have to empty random dungeons. Basically the research of new Missions take for example 3  turns, and one dungeons is a turn.  You can accelerate the research and unlock other buffs by other researches, but these also take turns. This was the old endgame and it is obvious this was reworked to rush out the story chapter. If you have finally researched the final boss, you can now research debuffs for the boss. These are enormously expensive (gold and other resources) and are done by the same research mechanic. So you invest a lot of gold and time to weaken the boss, run dungeons, get better gear and try to enjoy the gameplay. But there are two huge problems:  1) At some point, the game forces you to start the fight. You have no other choice. Several battles with different tasks follow. And hopefully you knew exactly which debuffs you were researching. Because: 2) If you die in this battle (because you weakened the wrong attack or a buggy mechanic killed you), all your progress is gone. All buffs and debuffs are deactivated, your gold is gone of course and you are back to square one. Now you have to waste a ton of time again, have to spend hundredthousands of gold again and hope you get him the next time.  Yeah it could be cool rogue lite feature, if the gameplay would be fun. But sadly it isnt. Its frustrating. I gave this game many chances. But the gameplay issues since day one, the chapter 4 mechanic that just an insult and Diablo IV and Path of Exile on the horizon i dont think i will every enjoy this game.  And i didnt even mention the bugs (and there are so many!), the boring gear system, the uninspred skills and the pseudo deep character progression."
60421532,english,1,424370,"Played for more than 12 hours, unlike some others. I have only purchased the game in the last 3 days so I haven't gone through the massive wait also like some others who would be salty about that now. Just like Diablo there is a very toxic community who seem to 'dog' the game and spoil things for others. Maybe that's just the hack n slash community.  Whats awesome, ie what I wish other games had including Diablo that I spent 1000's of hours playing: -Hypnotic wheat animation, I've already spent moments running around in it just for relaxation purposes. -Music that reminds me of Baulders Gate, that I also spent 1000's of hours playing -Leveling like I've never seen before. Some aspects are familiar but then something different. -Skills are just found and can be learnt by any class. -Tumble for everyone. -Voice for all. No more reading. AND did I hear Minsc (Jim Cummings)? I hope I did. -Random Treasure chest spawn locations. Can;t guess where they will be at the moment. So gotta look around. -No limitation on who can wear the armour you find. -STEAM PUNK theme. Love that, time to move forward in time. Why don't sequels do that? start why back when and move forward after a few releases. -Some old familiar mechanics but also some new. about 50/50. Now I am interested but not completely lost. -Loving the varied weapon sound effects. I can it the same thing a few times and get different sounds from my sword.  Now those complaining about the time for release. Kinda reminds me of waiting for Diablo 4 or Linage. This team is a lot smaller. Remember when Diablo 3 came out. People said it was coonie/goonar rubbish but it got patched and patched and worked on. Just like assetto corsa when it came out as well. Patience is key these days. No games come out like Baulders Gate these days that are awesome on release. Makes me thing that waiting 2 years after the release is better when I think about it. Release is more like early access these days.  I hope this review is ok with mentions of other games."
39909780,english,0,424370,"* A year later.... + some, They finally shiped a update ""the new junk"". Gave it 1hr and will unfollow this crap.   ___________________________________________________________ I love the genre and see tons of potential in this, but for now there is way too little content to recommend it.  I know its alpha but almost two years in early access you should be able to show a bit more content. 20hrs in I got 3 level 20 chars with good gear and basically just farm for nothing.  My concern is that it been in alpha since 2015 and first ETA said it would go beta in 2016 (from Kickstarter). Even then they stated four years of preperation and all the storyline etc was done.  Open to change the review once I feel that I can recommend the game to others but for now just add it on your follow list."
105779535,english,1,424370,"cool game. visually amazing, worth it if you like games like diablo or path of exile.  Just beware that you have to play this game in offline mode otherwise its pretty much unplayable due to only 25% of your attacks actually hitting and lag walking all over the place, this will probably never be fixed either.  Your progress is also wiped when you switch to offline mode.  So if your reading this it might be best to put it in offline mode right away when you start."
71380132,english,1,424370,"I am torn with rating this game. Its has huge potential but also some severe problems.  Pros: - huge skill tree (you can develop your character just any way you feel like) - Interesting feature to build up your ""city"" to support and aid your hero - awesome graphics (including battle animations)  Cons: - laking endgame content (especially loot: no sets and highest tier items are the worst in game) - not very engaging team of developers (they like to nerf skills and create the most useless unique items possible showing that they dont understand their own game in that respect) - due to the afore-mentioned there is a severe limit on character development possibilities (yes you can chose any skills you like but in actual fact only very few builds really work well)  I will give this a thumb up simply because I hope that the developers will eventually create meaningful set items and fix many of the useless skills.  Dont buy this game yet. Put it on your wishlist and wait for the problems to be solved (and a sale) !"
63860641,english,0,424370,"After playing Wolcen for nearly 50 hours, reaching level 70 and Expedition level 103, I feel that I can finally share my opinion on this game with others.  Wolcen is a beautiful game full of potential, but ultimately unpolished in it's gameplay elements with very little to no originality. it isn't to say no effort was put in this game, but these efforts weren't put where it mattered the most.  Let's begin with the good stuff:  Visuals:  The graphics and environnements are gorgeous. The ship graveyard in the intro is simply amazing. The Spells and Skill visual effects are also very good. The character model are quite decent and the transmog (fashion) system is quite simply what games these days treat as standard. Finally, the enemy models are clear and a quick glance will let you know what you are up against. Zones are also distinct from one another.  Audio:  The audio is good. The music is good while it isn't memorable. The voice acting is solid for the most part. Finally, the sound effects of weapons/skills/spells sound impactful. The gear drop as various cue for different rarity and items type and it is quite clear what drops on the ground based on sound only.   Boss Fight (during the story) :  While heavily inspired by Diablo 3 upon release, the boss fight are multi phased encounters with various mechanics, patterns and overlaps to master. You will most likely die and struggle at some point or another on your first run through each of them. Ressource management is key and mechanic anticipation essential. I had a good vibe of the Inferno d3 level of difficulty (minus the enrage mechanics on all boss) and that was perhaps the best thing d3 did on release.  and now, for the not so good:  Gameplay:  While the gameplay in a Arpg isn't necessarely very deep, in Wolcen it is straight up braindead (outside the boss fight which represent 1% of the game). You spam a main skill and plow through mass of enemies without a second thought. you dodge from time to time and that's about it. Base skill cast speed is ludicrously slow and it is painful to cast a buff that last 5 second and look at a 2 second animation that stop your movement dead in it's track.  While skills are visually nice, very few ends up being fun to use along side one another. you to use 1 of 3 types of skills. A range weapon/dagger allow for rogue skills, a melee weapon allow for melee skills and a staff/catalyst for spells. No real class, no real skill mixing, that's pretty much it. You play what your weapon gives you. Enemies don't get smarter and are basically scaling hp/dmg sponges.  ARPG Grind Loop:  This one is perhaps my biggest dissapointement with this game. There are no meaningful, build defining items in this game. Quite simply all items do, is buff certain stats. The end. You would think unique items (which seemed very interesting at first) would have an impact on build, since they allow sometime the use of other class skills, but no. They don't scale past level 40 (campaign ends at level 40 ish). They are so rare while leveling that you will never use them. you use rare items and the ''legendary'' (rare with 1 or 2 extra stat buff). Max level requirement tops at 60 and the items get stronger (a few extra numbers). They had some good ideas with the end game unlocks, where you unlock feature by starting projects and completing them by playing. Sadly, it doesn't equate to much more than a few features unlocked which barely improve a meaningless, shallow grind, just a tad better.  Identity:  Now this one is sad. This game, while definitely full of passion, doesn't have a strong identity. It's Diablo 3 mixed with Path of Exile. You get a few good bit of both game, without ever getting very deep in what made those other 2 unique. The gear design is very diablo 3-esque (which is just stupid considering how much better d1 and d2 design is), the skill tree is a less developped PoE version, mainly providing number change rather than gameplay change. There is a ascended form (big immortal high cd low duration form) but it's actually useless and clunky about 99% of the game. it feels like a concept that got abandonned near the end of developpement but left in the game because there was so much time investement in the visual design of the system. Ultimately, Wolcen fails to bring any form of authenticity to the ARPG table, which is severly lacking in my opinion.    I will skip over the many gamebreaking bugs of the few days as I think the dev did a decent job at fixing them while probably being under pressure to meet a deadline release date imposed on them by the publisher. Wolcen was a fun experience for a few hours, but I cannot see myself come back to it any time soon. Unfortunate for a game that was 4 years + in production."
71195108,english,0,424370,"Like everyone's saying, this game's just... meh.  It's not special, it's not interesting, and while it's pretty, it's also buggy as heck.  The game truly lost out on what made it so unique during development too, gradually becoming more and more generic and soulless.  This isn't just seeing the past with rose tinted glasses, as it had problems at every stage of development, but back when I bought this game it really did have an innovative skill system where you could do literally anything you wanted to with mixing and matching your abilities.  Now it just has a few distinct weapon classes that determine what skills you can use and the only way to go out of them is to change your weapon or to be lucky enough to get gear that lets you cast something else, because your skills sure won't let you by default.  More importantly, it's just horrendously balanced, with several skills being pointless, and the story really is just... so default and boring that it's painful.  I know ARPGs don't tend to have the best stories in general, but they could have at least tried to keep some of their initial story's concepts.  I'd avoid it for now, honestly.  The first hours seem to suck in new players, but a lot of people end up feeling a hollow experience in the end."
95060401,english,0,424370,"I've read numerous reviews and some of the more recent reviews stated that a lot of bugs had been fixed. I trusted those reviews and honestly have to say that I am very disappointed in this game.  The Pros:  As I first started playing I was liking Wolcen. The graphics are astounding.  The storyline is engaging and drew me in even further. The implementation of skills are unique and don't lock your character into a single playstyle. The soundtrack is nice and the voice acting is superb.  I thought that since the main aspects of this game were well implemented that this had to be good news and that the developers must have learned from their mistakes and finally fixed their broken game.  The Cons:  Offline characters are separate from online characters. You cannot cross over from offline to online or vice versa. Offline is the only true way to play single player.  If you want to play single player while using an online character then you are forced to flag your game as private.  But nobody plays multiplayer in the first because it is a shit fest of lag and skills not doing damage to NPC's.  There are no side quests. You must follow the storyline. The only semblance of side quests are when you enter a sub-area of the static questline and every time the only goal is to kill all the npc's. These 'side quests' are identical in every zone. Every. Single. Time.  The gold collecting pet gets lost and stuck. Several times I had to backtrack to attempt to get it unstuck. If it did not work than I had to restart the game and I ended up losing all progression through that part of the map and was forced to restart from the previous Town Portal/Waypoint.  The monsters and bosses are mindbogglingly simple. There is no threat of dying and if even you were to come close then you just use a health potion and your life meter is instantaneously refilled. Then the health potions are easily refilled as you kill more NPC's. It's really easy to NOT perish.  As a Summoner my army would sometimes just simply stop attacking NPC's. Fortunately/Unfortunately the game is so embarrassingly simple that I was able to solo each encounter and afterwards my army would return to attacking NPC's again. This bug could prove to be fatal if they game had any semblance of difficulty because there are achievements that you can attain for not dying.  When looking at items in your inventory you hover your mouse over them to see the stats, as is with most every ARPG. Yet more than half time when I would open my inventory hovering over items would do nothing and closing and reopening did not fix the issue. I mean all it ended up taking to fix this issue was  to simply click inside the inventory and the hover function would return to normal. Not game-breaking but still very annoying.  There are invisible walls that blocked my path even though the map showed that these areas should be easily navigated.  I can't imagine how many more bugs I would have encountered If I had decided to continue playing. Each of the bugs on their own merit are not game breaking (except for the Summoners army bugging out) but it is the sheer numbers and frequency of recurrence that killed all mediocre enjoyment I had.  edit: Corrected several spelling mistakes. Game is still garbage."
63474438,english,0,424370,"Don't buy the game yet, way too many bugs as it is. I made it all the way until act 3 before the game decided to reset my character's story progress from the beginning. Kept all the gear/levels, but now I have to grind through the story once again.... Feels bad man, especially since the later areas are super repetitive."
68533935,english,1,424370,"This is one of the harder reviews I have ever had to do. Wolcen is a complete mixed bag of emotions, fun gameplay, lack of polish, and frustrating bugs. It's an ARPG, which means at it's very core, I am probably going to like it.  I'm a well traveled dungeon crawler as my first game was Champions of Norrath on PS2. Sacrilege to those that started with the Diablo series, but I simply missed D2 in it's heyday. My favorite ARPG of all time is Diablo 3 with Path of Exile following closely behind. I have well over 700 hours into Diablo 3 with over 300 hours into Path of Exile (my most played Steam game).  I value exciting, visceral combat above all else. The game being nice to look at doesn't hurt either.  This is why I find myself recommending a game that is honestly, a bit of a mess. Wolcen launched with a shit storm similar to Diablo 3's launch. Nobody could log in and bugs went wild. Full disclosure, I had the game on launch and elected to play offline. At the time of this review I am sitting at 35 or so hours of gameplay. ALL of those hours were offline which saved me a ton of headaches.  Wolcen does a lot of things really well. The game is just flat out gorgeous. I have spent a lot of time in the transmog screen perfecting the look of my character. My character in Wolcen looks 10x better than any character I have ever made. In any game. Particle effects are gorgeous. The environments are destructive and look great. This is the pinnacle of graphics in an ARPG.   The combat is really, really good in Wolcen as well. The game manages to have the weight and fluidity of Diablo 3 without being a complete rip off. Diablo 3 combat is structured around using resource gaining abilities to then use resource spending abilities. Wolcen instead goes for a tug of war resource system where you use willpower abilities to transfer into rage abilities and vice versa. It's fun to play with especially when you start getting gear and passive nodes that speed up those transfer times.  Gear in Wolcen is middle of the pack. It's not the stupidly simply itemization of Diablo 3 where you simply look for green arrows and it isn't the extreme complexity of Path of Exile. I feel like Wolcen strikes a solid balance in the middle ground in itemization...which the game tends to do in general.   Nobody plays an ARPG for it's campaign, but I'm happy to report that Wolcen probably has the best campaign out of modern ARPG offerings. It's fairly well written and the voice acting isn't bad either. It's quick and once it's over, you don't have to deal with it again. You stay in endgame mode much like Diablo 3's ""adventure mode."" Perfect.  So that's all the good. What's the bad?   The endgame is lacking right now. It exists, but it's incredibly repetitive. You blast through what are essentially nephalem rifts from Diablo 3 and build upgrades for the main city which gives you certain bonuses like an extra skill slot or higher magic find stats. That's about it. The maps get boring fairly fast and the developers made the poor decision of having the end of the run boss spawn in a static location. When you fill up the kill meter the boss should spawn on top of you like it does in D3. Instead you have to back tread in the instance that you already passed the boss area or fight through meaningless hordes to get to the boss area. It's sloppily done.  The game is a fairly buggy mess as well. As I already mentioned, I played exclusively offline. Which means I avoided probably 90% of the problems. Players that played online reported stash wipes and even entire characters vanishing. These are the kinds of bugs that would cause me to uninstall the game immediately. Thankfully, they never happened to me. Instead I came across crashes, graphical glitching, campaign missions not properly triggering cut scenes, passive nodes that either do not work as intended...or just don't work at all, and chests in impossible to reach locations.  The game just doesn't feel like it is a complete game. Everything just kind of feels half baked. In the end, you have to ask yourself what you are looking for in an ARPG. If you want a game with hundreds and hundreds of hours...this likely isn't it. After 30 plus hours I just didn't have the drive anymore to do another three expeditions. I ultimately went back to Path of Exile. This seems like a non recommendation, but it isn't. I thoroughly enjoyed my 35 hours in a $35 game (I bought it when it was on early access). It's a game with a pretty solid foundation that needs a lot of repair work and added content. Hopefully the devs don't give up on this game because I think this game could be something special this time next year."
83081451,english,0,424370,"Singleplayer experience first playthrough at launch was ok, and quite fun. Even though many talents were not working and a lack of viable builds. End game was boring. Dropped the game.  Online was riddled with bugs I heard, and the fact that 100,000 plus players dropped the game within weeks says it all.  Came back after Blood Trail. Played an online character, bugged campaign within 30-40 mins, could not progress. How the developer still release broken/buggy content is beyond me. Dropped again.  STILL NOT RECOMMENDED."
129787478,english,1,424370,"I completely gave up on this game back when it released in 2020. It has come a long way and game play is much better and frankly, fun. Give it a second look. There is a lot of fun to be had here,"
65699557,english,0,424370,"ARPG, mix of diablo and Path of Exile I would not recommend this game for 2 reasons: 1) Too many critical bugs 2) It's just a simpler version of PoE If you read this in 1+ years and think they PoE is too complex for you, it might be worth trying Wolcen, but look at the patch notes and be sure they have fixed all the crashing bugs before you buy!  The passive skill tree in Wolcen is a simpler version of PoEs but it is too simple. After figuring it out, there is really only a few choises to make, and the rest is given. The active skills work in a similar was too D3s skill runes system, and (opposite of the passives) this works better than D3! The story is nothing spectacular, but it's not bad ether. Good enough for an ARPG.  It feels like a mix of diablo and path of exile, where diablo have the AAA UI and story, and PoE have the gameplay,  Wolcen have more AAA feel than PoE and more gameplay than diablo (or rather, i expect it will have after a few updates)  Bugs bugs and more bugs: It's another title that looks good on paper, but is about 1 year too early for release. The bugs are many, but the game killer bug is that when you play the endgame content, you have to play 3 dungeon levels in a row, but if the game crashes no progress is saved. This means you can play for 1-2 hours and then the game crashes as you turn in for reward and you have wasted 1-2 hours for nothing. If it wasn't for the gamebreaking bugs, i wouls have recommended this game for all players that like ARPG and thing PoE is too complex.  A good first try, but not good enough :)"
50772177,english,0,424370,"The devs seems to still struggle in figuring what they want to do with their game and also can't seem to focus on one thing at time, which has lead to countless delays and the game being redone from scratch twice since the early access started 3 years ago.  It feels like they don't really know what they're doing at all... instead of focusing in completing the core features of the game, like adding new acts and skills, they go around adding random stuff that is totally pointless to bring at the current state of the game... Who the hell cares for a Housing system or an Arena, when the game is STILL under development, our characters don't even have access to the complete passive skill tree, and our characters will get wiped every now and them??? It's like they can't really decide what they want to do with Wolcen at this point, and I wouldn't be surprised if they simply gave up on this game.  If you're looking for a cool ARPG, then I recommend you to look elsewhere, because this game will take forever to be finished at this pace... if it ever gets finished.  Wolcen: Lords of Delay is a more fitting name for your game.  Update:  I just received a warning from one of the developers saying I was being ""disrespectful"" on a forum post where I shared my feedback and disagreement on preventing you to use spells without equipping spell catalists on your character... I heard people getting their feedback posts getting ""shot down"" by developers, but I thought they were being dramatic or even trolling to piss the devs off... that was until it actually happened to me and I got this warning message saying I was being disrespectful in my post.  I advise anyone that is reading this game to stay the hell away from this game, because the devs are either insane, or just don't care for honest feedback from people wanting to help them to make a better game and just wants to be praised for whatever crap they do to their game.  I'm officially done with this game, and I advise people to stay away from it, to avoid stressing yourselves up."
69958089,english,0,424370,"Despite the fact that the game underwent ALOT of reiterations, the final product unfortunatly is no longer what made the game unique in the first place on top of being a technical disaster in many ways.  Wolcen, formerly Umbra initially managed to get quite some attention with a broad skill system on top of the still existing talent wheel system. Though the wheel system in its core concept is still present, most nodes mostly just consist of simple stat bonuses that offer no noticeable benefit. There are a few nodes that actually do something to enhance your playstyle but these are quite rare and should have been added in a big quantity instead.  The ability perk system was another system that used to alter spells to a point where they totally escalate like launching 8 fireballs in a cone instead of now just having a slow missile that's not even great. The game should have embraced that level of craziness instead of being the sterile game that it is now.  Another major OOF is the removal of the open world. Umbra used to be open world so you could travel through the world with few up to no loading screens at all. That is completely gone. It's now a typical isolated area style of game where zones are being split by portal like doors and passages. A shame.  The story is okay'ish. It's not really special as it's basically: bad god wanna invade the world and control everything and (of course) you are the guy who will prevent that. However, also here is a big OOF: the story is not complete. There is a big chunk of content cut from the final part of the game as you can see that Stormfall changes during the final act while it has no context at all and we don't even get to fight the true bad guy of the story. Based on what is left of it inside the game, the best part of it was yet suposed to come but apparently they went out of time and hat to make a choice.  Artwise the game is gorgeous. The environments are beautiful and the music is pretty epic. Nothing to complain about here.  Now to the ugly part - the bugs. The game launched in a partially unplayable state. The multiplayer completely died for days and the singleplayer mode was riddled with bugs in all possible ways. From duplication exploits, over non-functional passives and skills up to losing all story progress for no reason. This went on for days and even today the game still has alot of things to flesh out.  But the true reason why they get my thumbs down... the only true reason: where the heck is the Driller?! (that's a joke btw)"
109249112,english,1,424370,"At launch, this game was not so great -- bugs, server issues, poor balancing, and ultimately an unsatisfying end game progression. But by now (early 2022), the game is everything I want out of an ARPG -- polished, wide variety of interesting skills, intricate yet not PoE-level-complex passive skill tree, fluid and challenging combat, and L O O T. Lewd loot to ogle at. It's almost silly how much time you spend picking up loot and examining it to see if you got something good, and almost every run you do get something that's at least worth chucking in to the crafting system.  There is a lot to do here yet, and I could see myself sinking a few hundred hours in to this yet.  Compared to other ARPGs: -Grim Dawn with expansions has a ton more content. Progression is slower, compared to the almost frenzied pace of finding upgrades in Wolcen. I like the combat and skill systems about equally. -Last Epoch is a long way from done, but shows a lot of promise and could be as good -Diablo 3 set a nicer standard for fluid combat with MMO elements like CC and party buffs and defensive skills becoming important. But the loot system in that game is F tier; this game is leaps and bounds better. -D2R is very grindy and there's no crafting and a very simple skill system. The appeal is mostly in the trade economy and the large player base. -Path of Exile is absurdly grindy. I love the skill system and variety of scenery and content in the endgame, but the pacing of finding gear upgrades gets slow and I lose interest.  If you like ARPG games, I think this is one of the best ones out there right now."
23826474,english,1,424370,"This game looks extremely promising. For an alpha its pretty stable and has actually a lot of content to offer. I really like, that I may explore the world while there are actually no quests to do (the available quest line will take you 1-1,5 hours to complete). There is a quite a lot of different loot to be found, so are skills. You will definitely get a few hours off the alpha at the current state.  So lets take a look at the game. I will concentrate more on the good things because its still an alpha. The first thing you will notice after starting the game is the quality of the graphics. Powered by the cry engine, the game creates really nice environments. The day-night cycle adds a lot of atmosphere. Running around in a pitch black dark forest is quite nasty. The lighting effects are really nice and add a lot of quality, especially to the magic effects.  Looking at the combat mechanics, this game has a nice system with two differents ressources. One of them is umbra and is more the ressource used by spells. The other one being rage which is filled by using certain spells or just by attacking. Both ressource balance each other out, if you use your umbra your rage increases and vice versa. This way you always have the possibility to use skills which is really nice. It also requires you to keep track on your ressources so you know which skills you may use at a certain time. Skills level up when used and may either be upgraded by increasing their power or optimising their cooldown / ressource cost. The character levels up by experience, you get attribute points and passive points when reaching the next level. The passive points allow you to strengthen your character in diffent ways (like your magic or offensive capabilities). The passive system is just your basic +% or +X to crit/something system. It would by more interesting if there would be synergies between the different trees or anything else which expands the system a bit.  I will update my review from time to time to reflect the changes the dev implements. So far the devs put out improvements on a regular basis and at a quite impressive pace. At this moment i can absolutely recommend this game!"
95332098,english,1,424370,"Wolcen is a solid and mostly conventional ARPG, but with some quirks that make it stand by itself. The interesting gameplay angle for me is how skill use is handled. Instead of using a singular resource like Mana to cast skills or spells, as is common in ARPGs since Diablo, there are two connected resources: Willpower and Rage. Using one builds the other. So, depending on the selection of weapons and skills/spells you're using, it's possible to use skills indefinitely (albeit potentially limited by cooldowns).   You won't be popping magic potions to enable you to use skills - rather, you will use one type of attack or skill which drains Willpower to deal damage while building up Rage, and then use another type of attack or skill to discharge that Rage, which frees up Willpower again. This means that you're actively being incentivized by the design of the game to use a good variety of skills and even to cross-class, rather than being rewarded for sticking to one skill tree, focusing only on one or two active skills, and sinking the rest of your points into passives (as some other ARPGs unfortunately fall into). This keeps your skill use varied and keeps combat engaging, by preventing you from falling into the trap of building a ""boring but effective"" character.  Graphically and in terms of audio design the game is great as well, and there's some stand-out voice acting from some of the major characters in the story. The story is suitably epic to keep you engaged in it for at least the first playthrough. Besides the story, if you like your build a lot and want to keep playing it after the story ends, there's a post-story mode which allows you to generate infinite random missions while using the resources you gain from this to build up a base, which in turn improves your ability to generate more interesting missions, find or craft better gear, etc. Personally I prefer to replay the story with a different build entirely than to grind away at the same character endlessly, but the option exists if you want it, which is great.  EDIT: Actually never mind, endgame is pretty fun with my current build, so I'm doing that too.  (Minor aside: most of the higher-tier pauldron designs are completely ridiculous, but you can put glamors on your armor pieces for free, so it's not a major problem.)  A lot of the negative reviews you'll see are about bugs which have been mostly addressed, or disappointment at the way that the development has been handled. Legitimate issues for sure, especially for those who have been following the game since its early development; apparently it was supposed to be an open-world game and became a more conventional Diablo-like as time went on. But I wasn't following the development and most bugs seem to have been addressed by now. If like me you're coming in fresh and don't have specific expectations on how the game should be, but just want a familiar Diablo- or Torchlight- or PoE-like single-player ARPG with a few unique gameplay twists in a fresh setting, Wolcen is a great pick."
61709639,english,1,424370,"Updated for release: Despite some initial (now seemingly resolved) issues with server uptime, stash disappearances, and player progression rollbacks, Wolcen is still an amazingly fun ARPG.  There is still some work that needs to be done to bolster the multiplayer aspects and perhaps polish up the character trees a bit, but overall the foundation they are building upon is rock solid.  Character customization is rare in ARPGs so I welcome it, I love the ability to mix abilities and playstyles, and I even enjoy the story so far which is rare in games of this ilk.    Some players are upset with the challenges the game and team has faced and while their frustration is understandable and I too have been disappointed at times, we have to remember that this is not an enormous team and that it is no small thing to build a game of this quality and studio around it; things will take time.  That's my opinion anyway.    I discovered Wolcen originally in 2018 and loved the concept of it, but unfortunately soon after my initial introduction to the game the team scrapped the build and rebuilt the entire game from the ground up.  There was a significant delay of about a year as the game was developed, which precipitated much of the vitriol you see in some reviews from the community.  Some players felt they were short changed on the original concept of the game, which I can understand, but I personally was willing to give them a second chance.  I'm glad I did.  The game has truly be entirely re-designed and conceptually reworked; it now boasts a steampunk aesthetic, cutscenes, and a more coherent story than before.  Thus far, I've been having an utter blast and praise the developers for taking such a big chance and sticking to their vision even with all the pushback from the community.  Well done; going to play this one extensively!"
60663993,english,1,424370,"Currently at the time of writing, this game is in beta, and it is feeling quite good. Pretty smooth playing and the controls feel good. I've had a few hiccups and bugs, but this is expected and therefore I'm not concerned with it as I can simply just go and post on the Wolcen forums.  I do not know the history of the game or what was sold to people, but as an ARPG, I'm happy.  It is less complex than PoE, and more complex than Diablo 3, which for me is perfect as I cannot deal with the sheer complexity of PoE builds at this time in my life, but wanted something a little bit more than Diablo 3 in terms of build variety.  tldr: the game looks good, it feels good, it has bugs, the devs are working on it, it is overall enjoyable and pretty affordable."
135010202,english,0,424370,"Other reviews have (rightfully) discussed all the bugs, so instead I want to cover the absolute mess that is the over all game design up to and including Act 4.  The marketing tells you skills can be customized with 16 different modifiers each, however almost all of them consist of ""deal 15% more damage"". Most skills don't have any meaningful choices beyond ""Summon one less minion but more damage.""  For a classless game, you're still restricted on what skills you can use by your weapons. Unfortunately there's no main-hand spell weapon, so it's impossible to cast spells with a shield. The weapon restriction is a bigger issue than it might seem since it highlights how few skills there actually are in the game. There are 12 Warrior skills, 13 Rogue skills (Daggers get to use Warrior and some Rogue skills, so they are an exception) and 18 Mage skills, of which 4 are summon-related. Since you can slot 6 skills at a time, there's not much real choice unless you go for a hybrid build.  The rotating passive wheel is a much better idea in practice. It actually heavily restricts freedom since you are still bound by what sections are adjacent and the devs decided that different sections (Warrior, Mage, and Rogue) should never be next to their related sections, so you have to path all over the place just to make a simple Two-Hander build, for instance. And there are so few sections in total that if you want to be a Warrior character and survive early you better build around Block since that's your only option in the second ring. Thankfully pathing is not expensive, but that leads to another problem where you end up with so many passive points that there are no real choices to make in your build, though I guess that's fine because most passive nodes are pretty boring anyways, including the big notable ones.  Speaking of being better in practice, it's amazing the ""Resource Opposition System"" survived Alpha, much less a single proof of concept. Playing a melee character and want to use your sweet shield charge ability to engage enemies? Better hope there's crates nearby to generate Rage, because by default you lose ALL of your Attack resource after combat. The only way around this is to build your passive tree around rushing to a specific 3rd tier node that causes your Rage to regenerate instead of your Willpower. I don't know if I can think of a worse way to handle this, to be honest. If skills are going to be locked behind your weapons, have your weapons decide your ""equilibrium point"". All melee? Rage regenerates and Willpower fades away. Half and half? Have them balance out to 50/50. Even hybrid builds are made super clunky by this since if you don't have the necessary resource and you try to use a skill, your character does nothing. Why don't you auto-attack when out of resources since that generates? Instead, when you need to be teleporting away from danger, you're just standing in middle of it.  Entering Act 4 as someone who never played Wolcen before now is super confusing. The story goes from climax to immediate cliffhanger to your character suddenly showing up at the city from Act I and being VERY concerned about an NPC you met once at the beginning of the game. No explanation for the time gap or even what happened, and apparently no other characters are even worried about whether or not the Big Bad is still roaming around? I get that part of the point of the story is that you are supposed to figure out as a player what happened to your character, but last time you were in the (single) main city, the entire thing was falling apart and it was filled with refugees. Then you get to Act 4 and everything is fine  all of a sudden and no one even mentions what happened to make things better.   Also, the (Act 4) voiced dialogue constantly differs from the on-screen text dialogue, and in three back-to-back conversations seconds apart, a captured enemy was immune to pain so you had to send for a specialist alchemist to get a truth serum, then when you go to send for the guy, instead your only option is for your court alchemists to work on a solution for the spell that is keeping him immune to pain, then after clicking the button to do so, you are told that the alchemists successfully cleared the no-pain-drugs from his system. Which is it? Spell or drugs? In addition, the tutorials for the endgame systems that are introduced in Act 4 clearly haven't been updated since its release, since they tell you to start Infrastructure projects that don't exist and congratulate you on successfully completing a project that wasn't even an option, much less one you did.  While some of the issues are baked into the DNA of the game, many others are either bugs that have existed since launch 3 years ago or design issues that they could solve in a single patch or even caught by a single QA person playing the opening of the brand new act with the sound on and also reading the text.  Ultimately it's clear that the Wolcen devs don't care in the least about their own game, so why should we?  If you're desperate for a new ARPG, it's fine at $10 USD but I wouldn't pay a cent more."

I logged back in and the game didn't save me putting on my new items and they aren't in my inventory. Both rings are gone, my shoes are gone, my weapon is gone and my belt is gone.  I'm fucking done. Uninstall it again. Losing all those items was the last straw of constant bugs and annoyances.  Honestly, I tried. I want to like the game. I really enjoyed the story and the voice acting in many parts of this. The world building was pretty cool and some of the environmental design. However, the game is just always in an unacceptable state and it manages to kill any excitement I have. I was really wanting it to work, but it always feels like it shouldn't have ever left beta. I think there would be less flak for that decision. Devs, I'm sorry. I don't want to be rude or mean, but there's always so much nonsense to deal with each time. I hope things can get sorted out for you lot. I really do.  This was all documented in a private, online game"
137534697,english,1,424370,"7/10 Decent game with very high potential but the team of developers are either not many enough to go up the ladder or they don't care about it anymore.  Pos: * Good RPG elements for a Hack&Slash game with one of the most intriguing and complex skill build i have ever seen in long time  * Weapons and armour easy to combo with preferred skill combination * Good graphics & skills animation * Similarities to Diablo games but not as evolved and tested as Blizzard's. * Keeps you in front of PC. Cons: * Poor storyline * Mediocre voice acting * The game itself seems to be unfinished, unpolished and sometimes unplayable because of the servers/region * Because i couldn't find a way for transmuting gems or combine it, i realised how useless is to keep it in the stash and how a waste of time was arranging it in the hope later i will have the option to make it stronger ones (if i haven't discovered the way to do that but there is an option, then my apologies...) * Very buggy for a game released 2-3 years ago. That was something totally unexpected and unpleasantly surprised * The Multiplayer option is DEAD! Either very long times to connect with someone or not working at all in specific regions. * The loophole involving rising in level for no reason and doing the same thing over and over again, just to get stronger and bigger is so cheeky and ... disgraceful. Probably developers were having a meeting regarding new content release or DLC's and decided to just give as a way to continuing playing the game but without NEW chapters, maps, stories, viable MULTIPLAYER option or something much more exciting. BREADCRUMBS.  Anyway! I believe it's first time in my life when i give a thumbs up or good review to a game which has more cons than pos's and the reason why is simple. I enjoyed playing it for those few 65h aprox and i still reckon it has a lot of potential with a proper team and funding behind.  I'm not a professional gamer or critic, just writing my opinion in a personal way, describing with my own words the experience i had, not trying to be to fuzzy about specific content. Before buying something i read most of the times reviews by amateurs like me as i do not trust nowadays the professional youtuber's or gaming websites for simple reason that they get payed sometimes for those reviews and this have a tendency to influence the decision about rating the game itself. Always trust the ""little people"" as they will have no hidden interest behind their decisions of rating a game in a good or bad way, at least most of them/us.

45623922,english,1,424370,I just have one thing to say. I've backed this game for a long time and you all have the oppritunity to replace Diablo in the spotlight while they grab for cash.  Do not fck this up. Think about the game from the players POV and it will be gold.
111259378,english,0,424370,"[b]Do not buy, this game is unfinished.[/b]   Chapter 3 of the game ends with a ""To be continued"" and it hasn't been continued yet. Apparently it was released unfinished 2 years ago, with chapters 4 and 5 ""to come"". So far the developer seems to be only adding ""endgame content"" (killing the same monsters on the same maps over and over again without any reason or purpose) to a game that doesn't have an ending. Safe to assume it will stay unfinished. Very sad, since what exists of the story is fun&engaging and the world is cool."
93931359,english,0,424370,"I had high hopes for this game but the game has been ""out"" for over a year and they still haven't fixed obvious bugs like having to click into the right window for the tool tips to display. I bought it a long time ago and thought ""Hey they'll fix these things soon"".   I just loaded the game over an entire year after release, and NOPE.  Please don't buy this garbage."
50075926,english,0,424370,"UPDATE 14/2/2020:  So where to begin, I've left the old review up as I believe its important to see the behaviour of the developers and mods, and also the treatment of people who backed and funded their game. But here we are and it has actually released... sort of  So as expected its now just 3 acts (not the original promised 5) and the game is much much smaller in scope, no overworld areas at all, not even anything as open as D3 has. Now this in of itself is not a huge deal, I enjoyed aspects of D3 (post ROS) maps don't need to be big seemless affairs like say Grim Dawns, but it is a loss to the original vision of the game (imo)   The builds feel more limited and generic, there are signs everywhere of where they have wholesale stolen ideas (even visuals) from other games and titles, now generally they are done pretty well but it has like zero originality. The visuals feel like Warhammer/40k rip offs mixed elements of Tyranny. The skills and skill system feel like Lost Ark and D3 had a baby (but not as good as either yet)   The targetting is still wonky even after all these years (was an issue in original alpha I presume its related to cryengine not liking isometric games) the jolts in quality can be seen all over the place in terms of a rushed release. Sometimes you'll be happily killing stuff smooth as you like and it all clicks and you'll be like 'hell yeah this is fun' then suddenly your targetting messes up or a hitbox doesn't register or you click on something and it just refused to accept it exists (etc etc) and your ripped out of the moment and just feel annoyed that they have come so close to making something good but haven't... yet  Now for the positive bit, I will hold my hands up it is much better than I expected but then I expected it to be total garbage so take that however you want. I already own the game if I didn't I don't think I'd buy it now based on what currently exists so my thumbs down will remain. BUT if your a diablolike loot game fan there is fun to be had here just expect and unpolished buggy poorly optimised mess... before I go some highlights of awfulness in the current release version  - Character models are horrific ugly and bad - Servers are a joke, expect to attempt multiple times to connect online - And when you do connect expect random weird disconnects at times that just throw you back to the menu without any error message or warning - Expect weird messages like 'Your client timed out' and yet you can still happily play on regardless - I can already see aspects where they are going to insert their grubby cash shop and squeeze the players for money  - Balance is an utter mess both of mobs and player skills to numerous to even detail - Numerous skills simply dont work as intended - Story is so cringe inducing it feels like an emo 16 year old with a penchant for Warhammer fan fiction wrote it - Various bugs that freeze you out of the game, chuck you back to the menu or ctd even in offline mode - As of writing this servers have now been down 3 days with no end in sight due to unforseen issues, my personal theory is a major flaw or bug has been picked up they aren't telling people about cause seriously it does not take this long to roll back a database.  Now none of those are game killers but considering the developers track record of how they deal with issues and criticism yeah if money is an issue I'd hold off on this one till a few months time, its currently unstable and deeply flawed with a bad group of developers who have managed to salvage something half decent from a mess of a kickstarter and then proceeded to nearly kill it at birth with an awful launch... grats  Also see below for old review and all the features promised in kickstarter that don't exist at launch.  OLD REVIEW:Terrible terrible scam of a game... don't believe me go check out the old details on their own website for a game that used to be called Umbra.  Stay a while and listen adventurer.  Once upon a time some ambitious developers promised us the pinnacle of ARPGs, it would have full open world maps, customising everything right down to what hilt we would have on weapons, player housing and an innovative dungeon system where you build dungeons for others to challenge, a headline feature called apocalyptic form that offered a new way of making your characters unique. They kickstarted the game got lots of money and promised lots of features.  Fast forward to today the game has been scrapped and started again TWICE now, every time the goals and ambitions of the project get more and more narrow, as of the current beta they dont even have a female character model its something (and i quote one of the developers directly here) they ""Hope to add back in at release""  The list of broken promises, half truths, outright lies, bad PR, bad communication, contempt for their fans is honestly to long to go into. Just recently a forum member discovered by judiciously reading the terms of service on the new beta (or alpha v2.0 as i like to call it) that they intend to implement a microtransactions cash shop for 'just cosmetic' items. This was never in their plans, in fact as early as late last year the lead developer stated they ""Had no intention of having a cash shop"" yet here we are with them preparing to have one just like POE does, except In a full price game. Note the conflict here with the huge level of customisation they promised in the original kickstarter.  Whats more the recent beta (alpha v2.0 in everything but name) is more limited and simplistic than the original alpha we had 2 years ago. Of course go to the forums and you'll see the usual white knight brigade saying how 'its a beta if you dont like it leave' except this isn't the beta I or many other backed, they did a total 180 on us and changed the whole scope of the project to some generic Diablo rip off with boring mechanics and a cash shop. Features like housing, dungeons all that is gone never spoken of, who knows it might get implemented some time around 2050 at this rate.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY wait till they release it (so never most likely)"
96311004,english,1,424370,"I wasn't there at launch of this game so I have no animosity towards this title unlike others. My thoughts are from a single player offline experience.  Pros   -Incredible Graphics with highly detailed Items and landscapes.   -Awesome combat system   -A compelling story with epic villains.   -The boss battles   -Large variety of Landscapes and villains   -Runs quite well. Can't think of single problem I've had.    -The overall aesthetic is just awesome, a blend of Warhammer 40k and Dark Fantasy.    -Great character progression.   -Extensive campaign. Cons.   -Not a fan of having separate characters for offline and online play.   -Extensive campaign. (It's going to suck trying to make multiple characters in a reasonable time.)    9/10  Must buy for ARPG fans."

50524556,english,0,424370,"This review may change...  At this point the game completely changed from something unique that was promising, to a Diablo clone. I had high hopes for this and about a year ago it was good. They shifted direction so much that it's not even remotely what the vision used to be. I'm still hopeful but to be honest it's probably just gonna be a failed Diablo clone with the direction it's going.  Update:  I'm sorry but these people don't know what they are doing. I've had this game for a long time and in the beginning it had so much potential with cool new ideas, beautiful artwork, open-world exploration, a skill tree that seemed to have limitless customization and a lot more than I'd rather not get into considering most of all of that is completely gone and replaced with some cookie cutter wanna-be Diablo clone and it's depressing. I don't recommend buying this game to anyone considering. Wait until it is fully released IF it ever is fully released. They have scrapped everything original about this game and restarted with nothing to write home about.  Update#2: Still trash. Nuff said...  Update#3: Still trash. These people really just screwed themselves. Should have stuck to making something new and not cloning other games. Kinda sad..."
92514356,english,1,424370,"Over 70 hours of gameplay on the clock, so thought it time to review this game.  TL;DR - This game is an excellent example of an ARPG/Hack-and-Slash. It may have its origins in a Diablo/Path of Exile clone, but it is far more than that and I'm actually preferring it to them. It's great fun and probably worth the full price. End game is best in class as far as I'm concerned - Fully realised with an actual purpose.  So, I've just completed the main game and now into end game. I'm still having a blast. Really glad I finally tried this game in spite of the negative reviews. Those reviews seem to stem from the history of a poor release and early bug scene but I can't presume to know everyone's motives. And it is a situation I couldn't blame them for either, but one I luckily avoided arriving a year late. I have encountered some bugs but they haven't been significant. It does feel like this game needs some further polish and tweaks, but again nothing that detracts fundamentally from the great game play. Players asserting this game is 'dead' are entirely unfounded, with the evidence of recent patches and regular development updates and the simple fact I am actively playing a great ARPG with friends.  It has to be said Wolcen is very obviously taking a great deal of its game mechanics directly from Path of Exile and Diablo 3. But this isn't surprising or novel. Beyond that Wolcen has its own vibe and some great little mechanics of its own. Wolcen is the most graphically beautiful APRG I've seen yet and the Cryengine works great in here. The astonishing graphics here made me realise one of the main reasons why I never completely got into Grim Dawn (in spite of playing for a couple hundred hours). Going for a classless system is interesting and I've always liked it since the days of Dungeon Siege. At the very least it stops me from feeling I'm playing another copy of some pool of classic builds. I would really have liked there to be a much greater diversity of character appearance choices to counter this because there are fundamentally no more than 5 looks per sex currently - which is ridiculous considering how easy this would be to implement. The active dodge gives the game a surprisingly enjoyable extra dimension I wouldn't, on paper, have expected to be this fundamental. It immediately brings a level of tactics and skill generally absent from ARPG games. But it also makes you feel your character more dynamic. The skills are varied, impactful and fun - some of them have real oomph to them. The ability to modify each one in fundamental ways is an excellent game choice reminiscent of Path of Exile's support gem design. One thing I have noticed so far is the game seems to encourage variability in skills and attack strategy. This means I'm using the full skillbar of 5 actions frequently in each encounter which stops the feeling of spamming one super skill continually many other ARPGs seem to fall into. Collecting them in loot drops and levelling them independently of your character is again very PoE but works well. It also avoids the frustrating trap of having to find items that will cater for the skills you want that PoE creates (although I wouldn't argue with you if you felt that was a feature). The items I have to admit I'm still getting used to, but the lack of a straight armour class stat is interesting and opens up the item collection in interesting ways. The almost direct rip off of the talent tree from PoE I just can't argue with because to me it is currently the best way of implementing this. The literal twist to it works great too. I also love the fact that this game is not built on the depressing requirement to play through 3 times to reach the end game. It was always a lame way of hiding a lack of content and story. The Boss fights so far have been some of my favourite in any ARPG. They've challenged me in the exactly the right way. The phases and pacing of the bosses have been brilliant, and pushed me to move and use space tactically. Giving characters three in-combat revives (Revive tokens) is an excellent way of preventing the frustration of an insta-kill or a simple mistake ruining the flow and experience.  The ability to modify and paint your character's gear is pretty inconsequential but is a nice touch and does, to some extent, make up for the lack of character appearance adjustment at the beginning. I also love the 'God-mode' or Avatar of Destruction. It isn't essential, but it is a heck of a lot of fun! The voice acting is generally pretty good and the dialogue is sharp and witty - some of it made me laugh out loud.  My criticisms are generally minor. Obviously they do need to prioritise fixing the bugs and improving stability - but again, I appear to arrived at the point where playability is no longer seriously impacted by any. I think there may be too many trash mobs making general progression at times seem a bit too easy. This is countered by the sprinkling of interesting elites with equally interesting abilities which at times require rapid adaptation. Despite all the interactive terrain features I would like to be able to go into more buildings and access more land features. I would also favour a little more sideline areas to make the progression feel less linear, but it's not a major issue here and there are plenty of side dungeons scattered around. Grim Dawn would be a good comparison for great map design. Overall the story campaign is very linear with virtually no side quests. Again, Grim Dawn would be a good example of how to do an interesting quest structure. I was surprised at how quickly the first two tiers of items (normal and magic) became completely obsolete, but this may be just be amnesia of every other ARPG on my part. The vendors really need to shut up after a while!  The long-term lastability of Wolcen will essentially rest upon the end-game, and I may check in again to update my review once I've played end game for a while, but basically the main game is in my opinion solid."
84601932,english,1,424370,"With a little over a couple hundred hours in game, I can recommend this one BUT, and a big but, be aware of what you're getting.  If you've read any of the other reviews then you're aware that the game is a buggy mess and the balancing issues are a work in progress, so I won't go too much into them; everyone else already has.  Considering the game has almost been out for a year and some bugs that I encountered on day one are still in the game is alarming.  But improvements have been made to both bugs and balancing so I guess there's something to be said for that.  Just read the reviews and make sure you can tolerate the game in it's current state.  That being said lets talk about why I like this game.  It's Beautiful.  No other ARPG can touch it on that one.  Also, it sounds great.  I crank the volume up high when I'm playing.  Combat feels great.  When you consider that the main point of an  ARPG is to go around slaying monsters by the thousands, then you want it to feel good while you do.  And Wolcen does just that.  It truly looks, sounds and feels great to spend hours slaying monsters.  Some reviewers have commented that the end game is redundant and boring but then again so is D3 and POE in that regard.  Again, in an ARPG you just slay monsters over and over again and in Wolcen that feels better than others.  Admittedly I think they could spice things up in the end game, but it's not that bad.  Another point that reviewers often gripe about is the crafting.  It's plenty in depth enough and the rewards for doing so CAN be there.  But as may others have said, you're basically playing a lottery where you can slightly shift odds in your favor.  Some hate that because you can never get the ""perfect"" gear.  They think that with enough work and investment you should get the perfect piece.  On the contrary, I like that you can never get the perfect piece, but rather keep trying and trying and eventually a piece comes out slightly better than the last and it's an upgrade.  In other words you are constantly getting better gear and working towards perfect but you'll never get there.  I actually like it that way.  Lastly, the theory crafting and ""builds"".  For me, Wolcen hit that sweet spot between D3 and POE.  D3 is too straight forward.  There's basically one right way to play your class.  And POE, well, we all know that one.  In D3 I usually play my class as the meta for the season.  In POE I give up and look up a youtube video.  In Wolcen, I make my own build.  I play around, test and tinker my way to something that works.  It's in the sweet spot where it's not so overwhelming that you just borrow someone else's work, but its not so straight forward that you can only play the game one way.    I recommend this one, but do you research.  Read all the other reviews and make sure you know if this game is for you.  I'm posting what I like about it because maybe someone is thinking about the game but can't find anything good about it buried in all the reviews about how bad the bugs and balance are.  I'm not saying those reviews aren't valid because they absolutely are.  I'm just saying through all the problems there is quite a bit to like about the game."
63480332,english,0,424370,"Currently a buggy mess. Played into act 2 and had to restart, where it sent me back to the beginning of the game at level 25. Lost all my waypoints and quests. Wait until they fix this up and lots of people say it's stable."
84770747,english,1,424370,"I have about 108 hours into Wolcen now. There is still a lot of game breaking bugs that shouldn't exist at this stage and the campaign was so bugged that I had to play the last mission 7-10 times in a row because it bugged out. Its almost to the point the campaign feels unbeatable solely due to bugs.   That being said, I freaking love this game. I wish I could come on here and say ""its not worth the money, don't buy"" however, I cant because at the end of all the bugs is a game that has so much promise and a very engaging and fun play style for the ARPG genre.   I wont talk mechanics because you can look those up on youtube. I just wanted to be one of the honest reviewers and say, this game has play value and replay value even with the overwhelming amount of bugs and sometimes crashes (for online play).   All in all, if you are a big fan of ARPG's and want a new one to play. I can fully back that this game is worth the money. I won't try to hide its problems from the bugs. (I cannot stress enough that there are tons of bugs and am purposely being repetitive, because I dont want to be what made you comfortable purchasing the game and then not be able to overlook the bugs)  The ONLY gamer I would say that should heavily avoid Wolcen are those who are only after an ARPG for the multiplayer experience. Please do not buy if you are not intending on playing solo and trying multiplayer occasionally to see if its running decent for the night.  I am the type that will get in discord and discuss what I am finding, doing, and experiences with my friends who are also playing solo and I believe that is the type of player who will find this game to be great even through its issues.   Long repetitive ""review"" over. Hope that sheds a slim amount of light on why its listed as mixed reviews."
64157392,english,0,424370,"I normally dont write bad reviews. But this is an exception.   Today patch 1.0.5.0 dropped. What a desaster - these devs obviously have no clue what they are doing. Bleeding edge needed a nerf, no question, but they nerfed the WHOLE passive tree. They altered different skills and descriptions completely which are not part of the patch notes.   I have played 133hours since release, accumulated ALOT of gold and affinity, have 4 chars with over level 50, 2 over 70 and ALL chars earnings where ERASED to 100.000 gold each and 10.000 affinity. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? Whole progress of last week was completely wiped. Also running projects were canceled (guess what, these costs are gone too), items disappeared (quality, rarity upgrades).   When i played the game over the last 4 years since closed alpha, i had high hopes for this one. But today and after 230hours, i applied for a refund. Enough is enough.  This game is a broken, buggy mess. And the nice graphics doesnt help either.  I am done with this."
48380992,english,0,424370,"Vapourware. Buyer beware. The devs of this game would rather send threatening private messages trying to dissaude you from making negative comments, than actually communicate positively with their community.

With these guys, it's always ""next week"" but next week never comes. Literally been a year with no updates, on a 3 year old EA product, with little to no marked improvement during that time.

128140687,english,1,424370,"I have one MAJOR gripe with this game so far.  And that's with the limited tiny space for stash inventory. The stash inventory space amount is way too tiny for the average player.  It's extremely frustrating.  Every time I visit the Stash Inventory chest, all I want to do is log the hell off, because its so annoying. Each Tab for Stash inventory should be at least 4x to 8x as large from what it is now. People like to stash weapons and armor for other characters they create but cant because of the EXTREMELY limited stash space given. In games like this, Stash Inventory should be MUCH MUCH more, because this game depends on players, to collect items throughout their game play and you cant do that, if the player is hindered and limited in the Stash Inventory. This needs to be fix ASAP.  This is a Great game to play, and I do recommend people to play it if they like games like, Path Of Exile, Victor Vran, Grim Dawn, Lost Ark  So on and so forth.   Also IMHO, the game looks better when its dark,  because everything else glows really awesome. When you first start the game, everything is so bright, but then at a certain point when you complete a certain mission and go back to the main town, its dark and it looks really really nice. ( I like it a lot).  I was forced to play in OFF-LINE Mode, because the online mode would not let me log back on the next to when I wanted to continue the game. I made it to level 18 in online mode. I logged off because it was really late. When I logged back on the next day to continue, the game would not let me continue as all I got was a black screen instead.  So I was forced to start all over again from level 1 via OFF-LINE Mode.  Also I wish I could sell the skills instead of installing the skills I don't want. This game forces players to install the skill first in order for you to sell the extra skills for Primotial. Which is very annoying. I SHOULD be able to sell the skills if I don't want them.   I have more stuff to say,  but I will continue to play first before I add onto this review. Again, This overall is a great game to play for those who have not played it yet. It just has a few things that are very annoying.   Thanks for reading."
107917693,english,1,424370,"[h1] Solid ARPG Experience [/h1]   [b] History [/b]   This game has come a long way since its Early Access days. As reflected in the Steam user review ratings, it has been a rocky road for Wolcen Studio and their flagship title. I've played it off and on since very early in its development. I've seen it go through some major changes and overhauls. The game we have today resembles the original very little. At one point you could even build your own house to display your trophies. It seemed that Wolcen didn't know which direction to go.    They wanted a dark and grim fantasy world ARPG. Hardcore gamers themselves, they wanted to make what they thought Diablo 3 should have been, a lofty and admirable goal. It took them some time to figure out what the fans wanted, but they did, and now it finally shows. This is one of those titles that would have been better off waiting for full release rather than making it available in early access, since current ratings reflect earlier stages of the game. It's a win for players, but the devs take it by way of long-standing negative reviews that remain long after they become irrelevant.    What we ended up with here seems like a compromise between the dev's vision and what the fans wanted. The game is much more like D3 than the devs would probably like to admit, right down to the voice actors and their lines. [url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2478830/] Carla Tassara [/url] ,who apparently does all the female lines in every video game now, is still ""unstoppable!""   [b] Current [/b]   A little history out of the way, the game is currently a solid ARPG experience that fans of the genre are sure to love. If you were disappointed by the early state of the game, now is a great time to dive in and start working a build. A big endgame update is on the way this month, offering 4 new game modes, and I'm excited for that.    What makes Wolcen different from D3, Grim Dawn and PoE? The classless build system. You choose a starting weapon and from there you can adapt your build however you like. Stats are determined by items, equipment and gear. You get your 10 attribute points per level, and passive skill points, to allocate however you like. Certain gear set-ups allow you to hybridize and optimize across different skill sets. You can use both magic and melee if you want. And you can switch it up at any time. This allows for an unprecedented level of freedom in your build. So far I've made a Void Witch, a Toxic Assassin, a Blood Baron, a Holy Crusader, a Pyromancer, and more, some of them from the same character.   Skills and abilities have real impact, they feel nice and weighty, very satisfying to play. Certainly there is a difficulty curve between mobs and bosses. Clearing mobs is no indicator of your ability to take on a big boss. While I haven't had to grind over already tread paths, the option is there if you need it. If you falter at the bosses, it is 100% your build, which is easily remedied by grinding and/or trying something different. The latter is not easily achievable, if at all, in other games in this genre. In Wolcen, you can switch up gear and tweak stats a bit, and voila! a whole new class to try without starting a new character.   The game looks amazing, built on CryEngine, it is more detailed than any top-down isometric I've ever played. It is truly stunning to explore the different environments. The gameworld is a work of art, and the 3D models for everything from gear to actors are no less aesthetic. This is a labor of love and it truly shows.   If you tried it before and walked away with a bad taste, try it again, you will be pleasantly surprised. Wolcen is a must-play for any ARPG fan.  *My ReShade preset [url=https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/11817/] Wolcen Grit RTX [/url]"

94006446,english,0,424370,"I came into it initially positive, but largely unsure of what I was getting myself into. I had a few thousand hours in PoE at this point and had recently burned out on D3. Suffice to say, the initial experience was very good - in fact, I'd say this game is honestly ahead of the curve of the current crop of ARPGs. It looks and feels like a next-gen ARPG in the vein of PoE2. I was very impressed with the game overall...right until I finished the main story. The story starts out alright, continues to be alright with some questionable plot twists, and then completely crashes and burns because of Heimlock. Not spoiling anything, but he's the most bullshit character ever written and the last 20 minutes of the story drove me continually more and more insane until the ending made me scream and still remains my favourite thing to rant about to anyone who will listen.  Beyond that, my experience up to that point had been very good. The ability system works well and allows for decent customisation, but there are some egregious cases of absurdly powerful combinations. Combat is very dynamic with an emphasis on using every one of your skill slots for a purpose, and dodging is just nice to have. Bosses are...mostly well designed, more readable, more convincing and more involving than some of PoE's bosses, but also easier to cheese. I did however find fault with targeting being horrific especially for melee, I continually found myself either running circles around what I wanted to attack, or being unable to stop attacking a target to interact with something or attack the thing next to it; it just never does what you want it to. Pacing feels a little weird, as there are groups of enemies predictably spaced out with considerable distance between them throughout every area, and on top of that enemy variety feels lacking with a lot of mooks wearing different shirts. There is also a distinct lack overall in abilities to use which hinders the variety in playstyles, The passive skill tree is a nice idea implemented poorly, with a mess of passives that seem to have no distinct rhyme or reason to what stats they give you or where they lead, often with notables that contribute very little to your build in comparison to just dumping points in random passives that lead nowhere. Oh, and Aspects of Apocalypse exist. Don't get hyped for them, they're almost completely useless after you beat the main story, because they don't scale with your character. All your stats are set to 0 when you activate them and your gear has no effect, so you'll rapidly outgrow their capabilities and they'll serve only to give you a temporary HP boost if you're in a bad spot.  Endgame feels like a pointless exercise, which may sound rich coming from someone that played D3 and PoE, but hear me out. You are to rebuild the city of Stormfall by way of constructing notable building projects and launching Expeditions, which are three randomly generated dungeon stages that can be modified for greater rewards by spending a small sum of gold or using a map item. Completing them grants Productivity which is scaled by your finished city projects and the difficulty of the expedition. There are a large number of projects to undertake which either grant you bonuses directly, like increased gold and magic find or unlocking an extra ability slot, or open up greater crafting options and new shops. The problem is...I can't find a point to any of them. There is no real goal that you're working towards other than ticking all the boxes on the Stormfall map. D3 wasn't much better so I can't say much there, but PoE is in a different league (haha) to Wolcen. Where Wolcen asks you to just pootle around doing whatever until you get bored, PoE tantalises you with bossfights, extra story, unique items and of course, better and more loot. For a time it was a big deal working your way to the centre of the Atlas to fight and beat the Shaper, and if you wanted to get that far you had to grind your map progress, push yourself and refine your build to perfection. In Wolcen...there's no drive. You can stay fighting level 40 enemies forever if you want, because there's not much reason to go any further. Maybe if you're an obsessive completionist you'll find fun here, but I've already burned out on it very rapidly twice over.  Lastly, a note on Bloodstorm, bugs/performance and ongoing development: I've played through the game twice, before and after Bloodstorm, and burned out on Stormfall restoration shortly after starting it both times. Bloodstorm is a...rather underwhelming update that adds a league-style mechanic to the base game and expeditions that's slightly neat but feels mostly inconsequential, and includes a new side story completely unrelated to the absolute bullshit main story that I doubt will ever be addressed. Supposedly it included a lot of performance updates and bugfixes, I've never had any noticeable issues with either in the past or recently but I've seen a lot of reviews slamming the game for terrible optimisation and game-breaking issues, so YMMV. As for development...I bought and played the game a year ago, and so far it seems the side story, league mechanic thingy and some new areas are the only new content they've brought out. There's been some tweaks to the passive tree and updates to abilities, as well as the aforementioned bugfixes, but otherwise it seems to have been fairly stagnant and I wouldn't hold out hope for things to suddenly turn around.  TL;DR, it's a decent game for a while, but is shallow and trying desperately to cover up its lack of development and refinement. Worth buying on sale if you need an ARPG fix, but it doesn't feel like it rewards your time investment in the end. It just feels like the developers dreamed up a vibrant world full of characters and lore and spent all their budget on voice acting and visuals, then realised this alone wasn't going to make a game and the remainder of the time and budget was spent piecing together an ARPG. Also screw Heimlock, all my homies hate Heimlock."
48979517,english,0,424370,"Reasons for my thumbs down and I refuse to re-review this game with any other ratings. Wouldn't doubt if I was perma banned after leaving my review.  - Devs are passive aggressive and very rude. - Numerous promises made to implement different mechanics or ideas into the game. - Updates are extremely slow and they dont give you any sort of information when they occur. - Same promo material gets recycled over and over. - 3 Years of early access and the game is pretty much in the same state. - 20 bucks for 1 hour of game play in early access is not worth the cost. - Same content keeps getting ""reworked"" time and time again.

69078465,english,0,424370,"[b]3rd December update: Fabled patch 1.1.0.0, Bloodtrail. Tons of things have been reworked, added and there seems to be significant differences. But performance seems to have been downgraded, game stutters, audio disappears, there's still multiplayer lag, visual bugs and glitches, progress stopping bugs and glitches and worst of all, loss of progress in offline mode. Better luck with the next patch. And any kind of communication from the developers is still non-existent. I don't think they're even considering cakes.[/b]  Publishing $20 extended soundtracks when your game, which was promising, is in a rather sorry state, lost most of it's players faster than DC it's audience after the Martha/Moustache fiasco, is still fuller of bugs than a medieval rat catcher's straw bed after a week of work, has an almost non-existent and pointless endgame and your communication with what's left of the playerbase (your loyalists) on all fronts is in the ""Let them eat cake"" area is an absolutely brilliant business decision. Best guess? You're trying to upstage Sean Murray in a few years time? Yes/No/Maybe?  With that out of the way, should you buy this game in it's current state? Short answer, no. There's nothing on offer here that you can't get in Path of Exile, Grim Dawn or even Last Epoch, which is in early access, but cheaper and with a more responsive team behind it.  After 90 hours, and some time spent in the endgame (up to lv139 expedition, no point in going any further), the expeditions became boring. The town building aspect the game features in the endgame is a good idea and fun in the beginning, but once you realize most buildings have no actual effect on the gameplay and those that do don't really change anything, it becomes a wasteful time sink. As does the ""crafting"" system the game features. It's hilariously expensive, ineffectual and has more in common with Konami's gambling machines than any actual crafting. The loot drops and upgrades are less epic than the reception Epic Games Store recieved when it opened it's flimsy doors, legendaries are underwhelming and unique items are almost completely useless apart from a few which are almost mandatory for useful builds.  The game features a passive skill tree which will be immediately familiar to any Path of Exile players with a few extra twists. That's a lot of skills and possible variations. Too bad most of them are useless and using them will effectively gimp you in the endgame, thus forcing you to use the same skills and builds (or at least similar) everybody else does if you want to progress to harder expeditions. The summoner builds were grossly underwhelming, with horrible AI and terrible scaling, but this seems to have been addressed in the latest patch (1.0.14, May 13th). Active skills are based on enneracts that are buyable in town and drop as loot from monsters. Skills can level up and have modifiers which you can mix and match, but not all the modifiers seem to actually be working, even after a few patches.  The combat controls are wonky, that's the best way to put it. There's something off with them and there's a visible delay on skills firing off. You can see the on-screen button getting pressed when you press the keyboard button, but it sometimes takes a few presses for the skill to actually register. ARPG combat is usually fast and frantic, but targeting in Wolcen really doesn't help with that. There were times when I clicked on a mob and the character never did anything or went to pick up loot which was near the mob I clicked. I even witnessed a character unable to attack a mob because he was in the middle of it and I had to ""move out"" of the mob to attack it. There's a dodge mechanic in the game based on a stamina system that's equally wonky due to animation locks and the mentioned skill delays. There's a very noticeable difference in difficulty between normal mobs and boss fights and it's somewhat ridiculous and poorly balanced, no matter what your build is.  Champions of Stormfall (the endgame) rewards for finishing expeditions is abysmal, even the high level ones. There's no gold drop scaling with higher expedition levels. Or any scaling that actually has any effect. I've found items with a high level difference between them, but no actual improvements on their stats. Oh, and there's a thing called mandates that you can do instead of expeditions. I think I clicked on one, once, in another dimension? Grinding out the town building part is tedious with no promise of any substantial or even noticeable rewards. Experience gains also drastically slow, to a snails pace, somewhere around lv 70, maximum level is 90. There's some serious grind involved getting to 90 (badly padding out the game in lieu of non-existent endgame?), like working in a mind melting office job.  The game also touts something called the Aspects of the Apocalypse, ""...one of the 4 Celestial incarnations available, each of them offering 4 different skills, and one devastating ultimate"". I've used it exactly once and it was part of the story. It was supposed to be something useful, useable and fun. It came out as useless, underpowered and completely forgettable.  The only redeeming quality, if I can call it that, is the game's visuals. They're really top notch for today's standards, but the performance is all over the place. I've had serious FPS drops on an RTX2070, 32GB of RAM, i7 and an SSD.  There were, there probably still are, a lot of good ideas for this game, but it went haywire somewhere. The main game page still has ""...regular updates and seasonal events..."" and a long term commitment statement from the developers. They've done a couple of small updates (which are around 3GB in size, go figure) which are purportedly fixing bugs and they've laid out some kind of a longer road map (catch-all term in the gaming industry nowadays), but there's a lot of work here in the controls, balancing, itemization, scaling and getting some goodwill back from the larger part of the community. The ethereal 1.1.0 that the developers promise is a long way away. The review will be updated if something actually changes.

In 90 hours, I managed to get ""Pick up 1 million gold"". That's a loooot of hours the developers intended for you to play this game. There's three achievements for getting to level 30, 60 and 90 without dying. Since the experience gain flutters out like a candle in the wind past 70, getting to 90 without dying might prove a slight problem. The others are pretty much self explanatory and no real problem. One is bugged (at least it still was when I got it in 1.0.9, there's been a few patches since), Princely Patronage, it popped when I only built one building, not all three required for the achievement."
64199029,english,0,424370,"As I said before, I came back after the Arise Patch for a rework of my review. So this was updated at 9/11/2021:  I did a whole new campaign playthrough as a summoner character. I finished the campaign at level 38, played 5 random dungeons after that, but since my previous progress was saved, there was no reason to keep grinding for the irrelevant city-building mode of the endgame. So I played about 10 hours in the new patch.  Summary: it still looks decent. The controll for range characters are ok, but please don't play melee, it's a mess.   Now that almost all technical hurdles have been solved, the real problems of the game come to light. There is still no motivating item system. I hated it when any red items were dropped (legendary), because I always knew that they didn't contain any character development or interesting properties. I only found 11 uniques in my 82 hours and since I picked up every single one I can say that they are all full of interesting to read but completely incomprehensible properties and I didn't find a single unique that made me stronger. That's why the uniques lie unused in the box. Even after more than 80 hours I usually can't tell from the itemstats if this one makes me better or not. There are simply too many incomprehensible properties and virtually no development through the items.  For whom is Wolcen in this state suitable? For people who love ARPGs but have already tasted everything else? No, because a new saison of Diablo 3 or a new character in Diablo 2 are simply much more fun. Diablo 3 plays several scales better, especially for melee characters, and Diablo 2 has such an iconic item system that every unique drop creates a moment of joy. Ergo, I can't think of a target audience.  Is it still possible to make Wolcen a success? From a developer's point of view, I think so, since they now have a reasonably stable technical base. But since the developers don't publish a roadmap, that shows that they have understood the real problems, I don't see enough insight here. Maybe you should buy the game to finance a 2nd part which will take care of the problems of the 1st part right from the beginning.  Yes I will comeback after the next content patch release for an updated review."

180612086,english,0,424370,"Wolcen is a mess of a game. I recently picked it up after they announced Online Play was being shuttered. As such, this review treats Wolcen as a singleplayer experience.   Wolcen has a solid foundation. It has decent moment-to-moment gameplay with satisfying combat and movement and decent character progression. The skill tree has an interesting ""rotation"" mechanic, allowing you to rearrange it to suit your needs. Your active skills have modifiers to their behavior that can be freely switched at any time, similar to Diablo 3's skill system. This opens the doors for lots of experimentation and varied behavior in skills. Gear crafting was almost cool, but the complete lack of transparency made it more frustrating to use. Voice acting made the admittedly cliche story much more engaging. The post-game has a cool ""city-builder"" gameplay loop, but it doesn't feel fully fleshed out.  The progression system's negatives begin to show themselves in the endgame. Many mechanics like multiple projectiles don't work properly, pets are an after thought, a loot filter is sorely needed, and leveling past 70 is a snooze without using cheats. Most stats are ""score based"" in their design, meaning they become less effective at higher level zones to artificially increase the difficulty by making your character weaker. Your crit/resistances/dodge rate/ailment application all get less effective the more you progress, bricking builds that rely on them. Enemy resistances also scale this way, with no way to shred them, which makes life leech less and less effective as you progress. You also cannot swap weapon sets, or save loadouts for skills/transmogrification, which would have been a great QoL addition.  There's a lot holding back Wolcen technically. The final cutscene of the game fails to load, skipping you to the credits. The UI doesn't always behave, where you can't pick up items or select certain UI elements, sometimes locking you in a menu. Animations are rough around the edges. The difficulty of the campaign needed to be cranked up a ton. It just got boring quickly even on max difficulty, despite the scenarios and maps being fairly well done.   For most people, I don't recommend picking up Wolcen. If you're morbidly curious, or starved for ARPG content, it's good value when discounted under $10."
134648264,english,0,424370,"The new company that took over from the old one had a great chance to create some momentum for themselves & the game. Finally completing the story mode after 3 years is not something to be taken lightly, especially after inheriting the original devs' mess.  Several years of dev ignorance & being passed onto a new team, Wolcen had the opportunity to give us something to play for some time before Diablo 4 launches. They had opportunity after opportunity to blow us away. They still have not.  Everything bad I remember from Wolcen launch version is still all I see in Wolcen 2023. I started fresh with a new Offline toon - deleted the one I hadn't touched since February 2020 - and nothing has changed, nothing has improved.  The general consensus is that the latest patch that includes the elusive Chapter 4 somehow made the game even worse than it already was. Existing bugs still exist, and they've managed to create more new ones. In short: it's an absolute disaster. But I wanted to see it for myself.  I stuck with Offline mode because I recall the online servers being a complete mess, and people are still reporting game-breaking bugs left and right today. No thanks. Not that Offline mode is much better. When you imagine playing offline, you think of zero lag and much faster response time because you're no longer subject to online ping. Right?  WRONG! The godawful input lag of about half-a-second I remember from February 2020 is STILL present after 3 years. Spell casting is still slow and sluggish regardless of your increased attack speed, and general movement is still like walking through thick mud. Optimization is still the sheets.  Then you have STILL the amateur mistake of a fully uncovered zone map. It completely ruins your sense of Exploration AND wastes your time by almost forcing you to walk around in circles, because you can't tell if you haven't been to a certain map location before. And if you're the type of gamer who likes to explore every inch of the map to see what you can find & use as you level up, it's a HUGE problem.  And then, everything I hated about Wolcen launch version still present in Wolcen 2023: ITEMIZATION.  Nothing is worth farming, every item in the game is a BORING stat-stick with not a single interesting affix to speak of. Skill damage increases over time the more you use it, and you tweak it further with various nodes you unlock during the skill levelling process. And that's all in regard to skill customization.  What the different versions of Wolcen team always fails to grasp is: In games like this Loot-hunting is half the fun, finding exciting new items and affixes that potentially alter your personal play-style and increase the Fun factor. Take that away, and you lose half the fun, because gear choices hardly matter.  Furthermore, it completely kills Replayability. There's nothing worth farming, so you have no reason to keep playing. You complete the story mode once and then you toss the game in the trash, which is exactly what I did 3 years ago when I completed the incomplete story. And what I just did once again, for good.  Thankfully I bought the game for 20 bucks when it was still called Umbra and it was during its alpha phase, when it had the most potential with its rotating camera view & awesome unique elemental staff attacks - both of which were removed from the game in the transition to Beta & mediocrity. I feel sorry for those who paid full price for this, especially long before today.  I feel even more sorry for all the early Kickstarter backers who were promised open-world exploration, a fantastic character creator, in-game housing, and lots of other great features. None of which survived the transition to Beta & the live game. Basically, we got RIPPED OFF.  Such a damn shame, tons of potential. Looks fantastic, great skill graphics, gorgeous level design & crisp textures, all Wolcen needed is a dev team with a clue. So many years later, still fresh out of that."

Which at this point is not a good prioritisation."
81633347,english,0,424370,"Like many, I will begin by saying I really didn't want to put this as a negative review. I picked it up at the later end of the beta, beat the beta with a friend, and decided that the game had potential. Well, it surely did.  So, my first impressions of the game were that the graphics were good, animations were a bit clunky or stiff, but the gameplay was decent. At a core it combines elements from Torchlight (damage types apply effects), Diablo 3 (arcade feel, modifiable abilities, numerous questionable design choices), and Path of Exile (Gate of Fates is the same massive unlocked stat tree, classless, abilities are functionally similar), slapped with an original stat system that worked like many other ARPGs out there. I had no real problems with some of this, but did it improve over time? No.  Upon release there were mass server issues, which basically meant the game was unplayable online. This wouldn't be a problem if the game allowed transfer of characters between offline/online. It doesn't. Never has, likely never will. I understood both of these issues to a degree, since the game exploded in popularity. I won't count that against the game, as it the problem was resolved in a time that I would consider acceptable. Still, there was a lot of negative stigma that came with this. As for characters, it's an anti-cheat measure. To be honest, I don't care for it. Grim Dawn has become my favorite ARPG by far, and my favorite game overall. I can play with my friends whenever I want, and offline whenever I want. And if I go into a pub game, I can accept someone may have item edited something in. But if I see it, I can leave. If you're hosting, you can just boot ""cheaters."" This annoys me since I have to play with an online character if I ever want to do multiplayer, and boom, I get a server in Ohio and have to deal with 79 ping 24/7. Not too high, but high enough to be noticeable. Are people going to be annoyed if this was allowed? Yes. Am I inconvenienced and annoyed? Yes. So either way, there's no real winning for the devs.  So I kept playing once everything was fixed, and proceeded to the endgame. There's no new game+, but there is Champion of Stormfall, which is a 3 stage dungeon crawler mode with the option to roll modifiers. Upgrade a city with massive amounts of resources and craft. Pretty basic, but this is where the game has (had, perhaps, since the game was just updated) massive balancing issues. I began to climb the rungs of the ladder into higher and higher levels, noting that gear level was dropping at monster levels rather than mine. This might matter in other games, but here, loot just became bland and mindless. The better majority became useless, and soon I found item level was essentially pointless. All that mattered were item modifiers, and good luck rolling what you wanted. Crafting materials followed a Path of Exile styled re-rolling system, but with even more RNG involved. Slotted gems were supposed to guarantee attributes of that gem type, but eventually I found that even that didn't matter. But after finding a red shield with good rolls, gear and dying also became irrelevant. Mechanically speaking, the game before Bloodtrail was beyond busted in terms of balance. I'll go more into detail about that below comparing the game then to now, but I quit once I reached the last possible level tier before coming close to max level.  So I reached about 90 hours, and that was when I quit. I looked back at the game, and began to think. I had built a character full tank (100% investment in the toughness attribute, all red in Gate of Fates), and was able to do enough damage to lag the game. I looked into what others had said, and why the game was mixed. Bugs were without a doubt the foremost issue. I can't offer anything there, because until Bloodtrail, I hardly experienced any, and as such, I will not speak on it unless it happened to me. So what were my problems, besides the loot above?   Abilities and damage were just years apart from each other. There's one thing for an ability being good, but enemy scaling in this game was dreadful. Bosses obtained millions and millions of HP, on top of modifiers. In the end game, I feel everything came down to Mark of Impurity. When a monster died, it had an option to detonate for damage based on its HP. The mark also had an option to spread on death- and this is where the ability was disgusting on anything. A tank could use a dagger to unlock the ability, throw on Juggernaut, and detonate whole late game waves and bosses in one combo. With enemies at level 170~ and a level 60-70 character, a boss could be one shot by pulling any 5 minions into the area, marking one, and then killing it when the boss was close. Has this been addressed? Yes. Mark of Impurity now deals weapon damage. But after running through the game with everything globally re-adjusted, everything just felt bland. After consecutive nerfs to ailment damage, mark, shifts to Gate of Fates, playing through the game again just felt bland. I tried doing a lifesteal dual wield build, and to cobble together something from it, but values are just incomprehensibly low now. Investing one point in agility gives 0.1% attack and casting speed, with 10 attribute points per level. So it went from one extreme to the other, where one everything was just too explosive and sometimes satisfying, to changes feeling so minute that the difference between Bleeding Edge (a rotating axe spell) and Wrath of Baapheth (Kratos style advancing chain blades) was ""do you want to walk forward and deal 250 damage, or stay still and deal 240 damage?"" This just dulled down the overall feel and made nothing feel like it mattered. Leveled up? 4% more HP and 0.5% global lifesteal as a major node.   This is already a wall of text near the limit, so here's a cut down summary:  The devs reacted a bit late to this problem, and Bloodtrail wasn't the solution. They tried, but the game was just in a mediocre spot. They released a massive balance patch, but it didn't change the basic issues the game has. There an essay I could write on strange decisions (the tough enemy modifier, crit scaling down with player level), but all of that's wasted. I was patient, and I wanted to like this game after it was patched. So I watch for an update, and then here it comes. Bloodtrail. I hoped for a new act for the story, but hey, a revamp of almost all stats in game, player and enemy. And behold, one whole playthrough and I don't feel like playing anymore. What was Bloodtrail, really? A Path of Exile league. OId characters became legacy, and new ones were needed to play it. For me, it even added more bugs as the final boss decided to leap into the void twice in his second stage, forcing me to quit to the main menu and reload. And new crashes for no apparent reason, along with glorious audio bugs that basically muted the game. I beat it deathless in my second run, and I'm done waiting for fixes. It's time to watch Last Epoch, and hope it doesn't turn into this.  I know this is a lot of negativity, but I will admit, the game doesn't feel like it was hollow like some assembly line cast metal piece. It felt like it had some heart put into it. So if a dev ever reads this, I want them to know that you did make something interesting. Even if the animations feel like those Chinese YouTube mobile game ads (sorry), the writing may feel it a bit cheesy at times, the art style was good. Enemies were well done, and each faction was visually distinct. Sound design was fine, and environments were pleasing most of the time. This was far from a dumpster fire, and there's people out there that still like your game. They might still get hate like they did before, but it's far from deserved.   This game's just not worth it, and it's not heading where it ought to be, and so I'm heading to other options."
66716231,english,1,424370,"I wanted to take my time before publishing a review of this game. It is now April 5, we are multiple patches in, and I have a lvl 78 character who is working on their last upgrade for the endgame city. I love ARPGs and play almost all of them to their endgame.  TLDR: Fun combat, great visuals, nice campaign, but a shallow endgame means this title does not have the longevity you might expect from the genre. Lots of potential, but it hasn't achieved its best yet.   Bugs: I have only encountered a few bugs in the game. Nothing I encountered was game breaking. I see lots of people struggling with issues on the forums and reddit, but by some small miracle I've avoided most (except those that impact talents and skills).  Combat: This game is slower and more deliberate than POE or D3. I find that combat is heavy. This leads to well designed boss fights that I found exciting and interesting. The addition of a stamina bar for dodging (complete with i-frames) is welcome to the genre. It allows mechanics to be designed with this resource/skill in mind. It is not your typical run and gun ARPG as both POE and Diablo have become. Combat has a weight and rhythm to it that you do not often see in an ARPG. I loved this change of pace, but this is just my preference. Further into endgame you can develop into a faster clearing build, but bosses still take effort.   Graphics: Beautiful. This game puts all other ARPGs to shame visually. I love the style, the atmosphere, and the levels. I like that skills are apparent without being overbearing (like POE). I always know what is happening on the screen.   Story: I can't believe I am saying this, but the game has a pretty decent campaign. ARPGs aren't known for their plot, but Wolcen does this very well. I think the game is worth the price for the campaign alone. I really enjoyed my run through the game and I took my time. I felt invested in the story which is antithetical to ARPGs.    Bosses: This is personal preference, but I love the bosses in this game. It reminds me of early Diablo 3 where the boss fights were mechanics driven and took a long time to complete. Act bosses are standouts. Endgame bosses are fairly repetitive.  Skills and Talents: This game has more depth than Diablo 3, but is much simpler than POE. Skills level up, get stronger, and unlock talent points to put into skill modifiers. This allows skills to morph like in POE, but in a more streamlined and easy to grasp fashion. Unfortunately, there are not many viable builds out there at the time of this writing. However, the groundwork is there for a deep skill system.  The talent tree is POE lite. There is a skill tree similar to POE, but each tier of skills can rotate to allow more customization. This is an awesome feature, yet not many builds are late game viable and the potential of this character system is not reached.   End Game: Here is where the game suffers most. End game shows glimmers of brilliance. I love the city building, but it will be too much of a grind for most. The end game functions similar to D3 rifting, but with the ability to use POE style map modifiers. Neat set up, but pushing endgame content to get to the top tier of loot can take a long time. This isn't bad, but it will likely feel like a grind. I can understand how people can get bored with end game in its current state. The lack of terrain, monsters, and bosses adds to the grind. In short, I enjoy the combat so much that it didn't bother me, but this is strictly preference.  Loot: The game has failed in this department, which will hurt it in the long run. Most great end game items are crafted through a POE lite crafting system. Materials are rare and spamming them is required for good items. Uniques are not interesting, most loot is purely vendor trash, and my best items I created myself. Without great loot to chase, the end game will lose its appeal long term. Trading doesn't exist so the economy just doesn't matter. This needs to be addressed to give the game longevity.    Overall: Wolcen is a very pretty ARPG. The combat is different from other ARPGs enough to be worth a play through. The campaign is great and the bosses are interesting. End game is lacking at the moment, so you won't sink thousands of hours into this game. There is so much potential here and pre-COVID-19 I thought the team was getting into a rhythm of patching out bugs/tweaking things. It has slowed down since mid-March, but that is to be expected with the current climate. The team did a great job with the game, but it is not a polished AAA title. It has rough spots, struggles with build diversity, and lacks a motivating end game. The systems have great roots and I expect this game to grow into a great game in the future. Right now, play the campaign and anything you get out of end game is gravy."
72772316,english,1,424370,"[h3]Two words my friend: (no, not [i]""No refunds!""[/i]) [i]""Growing Pains""[/i].[/h3]  Yup, that's the essence of what Wolcen was, and actually still is. It was born in pains and even now, after years of development it still crawls in pain. Unbalanced, unfinished, incomplete. Passives working randomly or not working at all, content missing, various bugs still present: from bad positioning (loot drops under surface) to hits not conecting opponents and so on.  Ok, now you are probably thinking [i]""Dude mistakenly pressed 'I recommend' instead of 'I don't recommend'""[/i]. No, my friend - it's not a mistake. I really do recommend Wolcen. Why? Didn't all those faults spoil my fun? No, they didn't. In fact I am having a hell lot of fun.  I don't know why but I really like this game. Perhaps it's because of its visual side? Wolcen is one of the prettiest action RPGs on the market. It's physics gives you the feeling that your character is really connected to the world and not just hanging hovering in space. Sceneries are beautiful, lots of various characters, mobs and so on. Everything made with a high detail polish. Character customisation for instance - is of the greatest: lots of armor parts in dozens of variations ready to put almost any color combination you want (different paints drop as loot).  Hack and Slash is about two things for me - combat and loot. Wolcen offers a great combat - especially magic. Spells are just awesome. Their power, animations and effects - game gives you the best in it's genre.  Then what about the loot? It's right there. Perhaps not a variety like in other H&S but it's good. Wolcen focuses on rare and legendary item builds (think of it like blues and purples from WOW or Borderlands, the difference lies in number of its abilities). There are also uniques but these are a bit different. They are not a build openers like in Path of Exile where you create a whole build around one item. Here they have their unique abilities but in fact they are just a nice addition to the game, nothing ground breaking. There are no set items at present in Wolcen and I think it's good. Why? Two reasons. 1st - I don't like being limited in selection of abilities offered by set items (after all it's my choice what to use, right?). 2nd - Sets feel very 'final' to me. When you finally complete one, some emptiness comes and you start to think ""Well, so it's done"".  As I have mentioned before, the content is still incomplete. Right now the main campaign fits in 3 acts and they are quite long. At the time I'm writting these words we're pending the next big content patch (hopefully) that is supposed to add next chapter to the game and various optimisation fixes. Personaly I can't wait to it.   In the meantime there is the end game and it's content is not so shabby (compared to other games). In Wolcen it comes in two forms: Mandates and Expeditions. The first one is just a single mission, a random map with a simple task (usualy to kill a number of opponents) that is rewarded with an item, some experience points and gold. Expeditions are more complex. They offer you a fixable level of difficult resulting in better loot drops and amount of experience and gold reward.  There is one more thing in the end game - a micromanagement of the town. You can raise new buildings and they will open new features and enhance character options. Resource that is used for buidling is called Productivity and comes from doing Mandates and Expeditions. It's a nice addition to the game but nothing extraordinary (rather a gold sink and a grind machine for completionists).  Current Metacritic score for Wolcen is something around 60% but most of the bad reviews focuses on technicals - weak optimisation, various bugs resulting in crashes, freezes, poor performance etc. I know that from my own experience, I've also struggled with crashes, memory leaks and so on but in the end I kept coming back to Wolcen. It has this indefinable fun factor that adds ""Just one more map/level/mission!"" thing. Game isn't flawless, actually it has few strong downsides but.. I still like it."
63730788,english,0,424370,"I'm not going to sit here and bore you with the server issues there's plenty of review stressing this.   unfortunately alot of the review tend to skip alot of core gameplay issues that  needs to be addressed , my review is going to touch on a few things that ruins the experince of this game for me personally.  1. Balance issues * so to start i want to touch on the stats balance. first off i can safely say ferocity and toughness is just flat out better in every way. leveling wisdom for ailment status chance is okay but it feel more efficent to just stack ferocity and ignore that stat all together. agilty is extremely weak with only giving attack speed. the attack speed you get tends to be underwhelming considering vast majortiy of your damage is coming from skills and makes usign a right click build (in most cases) feel clunky and not worth it at all.  *class balance feels really bad. SPELL CASTING class set ups feels extremly weak (in part with the way wisdom work in this game) the class as a whole does not scale very well at and the spells available simply just isn't that good.   Melee Rouge feels very weak as well. the amount of point you need to put into agility for your dagger to be useful is way to many and hoestly never truly feels useful. You take ton of damage which forces you to pour points into toughness and in turn take points away from agility making the agility stat just that more useless.   Warrior class is very much overtuned and more specifically Bleeding Edge is the only skill you need to plow the story and currently my late game my level 60 is still strong enough to walk thru level 70+ enemies.  it seems the devs has put alot of work into the melee warrior build with most skills feeling good to some extent unlike a good portion of rouge/spellcaster skills.    2. Skills and UI issues and game clunkiness  * I want to start off by saying that this isn't the case for every skills but for quite a few the skills simple just doesn't work. go into your game now and use sovereign shout with the modifier that stuns and try using it. IT DOESN'T FUNCTION at all (at least for me as of 02/18/2020). I'm sure you can find many more skills like this that has this issue. * Tool tips is another issue. quite a few simply do not give you enough/lacking information.  A skill that comes to mind is Duskshroud when you add the Friendly territoy ( it adds a curse effect to the skill) modifier to the skill it tells you the duration, the chance and the stack but it doesn't tell you what the curse actually do. As a new player you wouldn't know what it does without looking over reddit or a friend. * Unresponsive skills/Hotkeys. i've died a mountian of times in this game simply because my potion hotkey ( Q Key by default) doesn't respond or respond late. in some extreme cases i died with full health. only after i died the potion went off and i was down. only happen once so far but still this shows how unresponsive it is. I find myself clicking skills 3-4 times before they trigger which makes playing the game very frustrating. * Lucky for me i haven't ran into it but charaters being deleted is a issue my friends has run into. I don't know if this has been patched or fixed but just know that this exist quite commonly.   In Conclusion, i personally can't justify spending 40 dollars on this game in its current state. 19.99-24.99 maybe or if you just want to support the company. otherwise the game is sadly a buggy mess that in my opinion would be a decent beta released title, not a full release title.  so as of (02/18/2020) this game in a no for me."
111059876,english,0,424370,"I played this game at launch (2020) and it had some good ideas, but unfortunately it was plagued by bugs. Fast forward to 2022, I gave this game another shot and while some areas improved, unfortunately the game still seem to be a mess.  The graphics is probably one of the best in the ARPG genre, but gameplay wise its lagging behind a lot of the competetiors (Path of Exile, Last Epoch, Grim Dawn, Lost Ark just to name a few). Overall only buy this game if you know what you getting into, otherwise I would suggest to play the other main ARPGs."
132986006,english,1,424370,"If you re not looking for endgame content that'll last forever then, yes, Wolcen is a really nice experience from its start to the end of its current storyline.  The content is still minimal, so this is not a game you can get lost sinking 1,000's of hours in right now. However it's definitely fun, the combat system offers what the other aRPG's do not.  The developers keep breaking their promises and keep going into silent mode; except for a monthly post that often doesn't bring anything really concrete on the table but empty promises.  So if you end up buying the game I'd suggest you to get it during one of its sales."
42030496,english,1,424370,"I read the reviews and I particularly gave attention to the negative ones. It almost made me not purchase and experience the game, fortunately I did and I’m enjoying this game more than my experience with other ARPG so far.. I’m loving the graphics and also the bright environment which I think is one of the factors why I prefer this than other ARPG particularly PoE. looking forward for the multiplayer update!"
189462141,english,0,424370,"Ultimately, I can't recommend Wolcen.  In its current state, the game is as finished as it's going to get, bugs and half-baked storyline and all.  There's a history here: My understanding is that this game was, at launch, a buggy mess. A very *pretty* buggy mess, but still a mess. The devs made a lot of promises while overestimating the scope of the work to create and fix the game.  The released a final patch and then cut and run.  They posted a final update in Maty 2024 indicating the shutdown of multiplayer.  This may not be a direct scam, but it's a close as you get the classic Early Access tale of a developer not following through.  The current state of the game is playable. The story is very engaging, but fizzles out near the end (guessing because they ran out of money) so you get a sudden ""six months later"" epilogue (which is the endgame) in one of the most pivotal moments of the final act.  Combat, mechanics, are okay. Not amazing, I would say feels pretty clunky by PoE2 or D4 standards.  If you can get it for $4 and want to play single-player, that's probably worth your time, but right now the most valuable piece of this product is as a cautionary tale and a ""Remember Wolcen?"" among ARPG fans."
100843543,english,1,424370,"I purchased Wolcen when it was still Early Released and i refunded it.   Fast forwarded to now when the game was already in full launched, I decided to give it a go one more time. Honestly because I was bored waiting for other ARpg since I just finished everything else in my list.   I must say it's been fun journey to finished the solo campaign.   The good thing about Wolcen is they give you the feeling of being kickass. Think of it as Dynasty Warrior (if you ever play one) but in Diablo II format.  Sure it won't be as depth as Grim Dawn or Diablo II. But I still think it is fun to play.   Personally I think this game deserve a little bit more positive rating. After Diablo II and Grim Dawn set the bar so high, I understand why players want only the best since they gonna invested hours in it. But I feel like Wolcen is build for something slightly different, be it intentional or not. It is type of ARpg that you can just start, play for half an hour and exit. Fast pace and action is what I think the main attraction here.   Now I know people compare it a lot to PoE and LE. But I do feel Wolcen stand on its own.   The perfect ARpg might not exist. Diablo II is one of my favorite but obviously I could find a thing or two that might be improved, in my own opinion. With Wolcen, I think they should go with pre-determined class instead of open options (you'll know what I mean if you try the game) but that doesn't mean its a deal breaker for me. It just the route the Developer take and to be honest it is nice to see breath of fresh air of stats other than the traditional strength, dexterity, physical, and magic. I think most of people have complaints because they asked for something groundbreaking and fresh but cry foul when it doesn't suit their expectation.  If I may draw a comparison, this game might be better than Torchlight III (given how much I love Torchlight II) and that is something. At the very least you will feel the battle more ""engaging"" as I am short of words to describe it. I found this especially true with melee character. Every hit connect with enemy feels badass. Even compare to Diablo II Ressurected (which is not apple to apple considering how old the mechanics of D2R already). Can I suspect the player that doesn't like this game is mostly ranged or magic type of character ? Because with Wolcen I always ended up playing melee regardless my initial intention. It just feels more satisfying.   All in all, at the very least you can enjoy the graphic. Sure the game crashed sometimes. During my many hours of run, I crashed 3 times. But luckyly no equipment are lost and believed me it was fine. I honestly experienced more crash with D2R with less hours of gameplay. Luckly none of equipment is lost on both games otherwise it would have been a deal breaker.   Will I invested all of my time to play Wolcen compare to other ARpg ? Highly unlikely. I know I will come back to D2R or GD if there is nothing new and I just want to be nostalgic. But to play Wolcen one run after real life work at the end of the day is really fun. Imagine it as playing relaxing game after hours of Dark Souls (what am I talking about, obviously some of you find Dark Souls relaxing).   Oh I forgot to mentioned you can customize your own character and equipment is detailed visually. You can equip different glove of the left and right hand. As well as different set of shoulder protection. My only complaint is that why not make all the way into shoes as well so that shoes doesn't have to come in pair anymore ? But seriously, some items are just imbalance, at least in my experience. You get lots and lots of weapons, armor, shoes, etc etc but i feel i don't get enough sash. Sometimes i think i am stuck with my equipment from the start until several acts in the future before i found the better replacement. But maybe that just me.   The visual of the character is pretty much like Warhammer 40k. So if you like Warhammer 40k homage, then you'll settle just right on. I definitely have no complaint on it. I just wish we get to have two handed gun, like riffle or something because we got handgun and bow&arrow while some enemy have sniper rifle on them. Now why is that ? And also, why not put crossbow as well ?   Overall, I recommended the game. Full disclosure, I got it on discount. I think it's worth it."
61347017,english,1,424370,"I have recently purchased the game. Haven't finished the 1st act yet but even now I am very happy with the game.   Graphics looks great although is the least important thing in games (imho). The game itself is very dynamic and although I don't have newest PC (i5  3.5GHz, 8GB Ram, GF 970) I have constantly 60fps.  I like skill tree which is similar to Path Of Exile one...although easier to manipulate and diverse your path. I very much like how you level spells and chose what modifications (increased damage, area, cooldown etc it should have) It let you modify it more to match your playing style.   The story is interesting although as I have mentioned I haven't finished whole 1st act yet it is very promising.   I love the idea of building own house...yes not the most important thing in Hack n Slash but I love the idea. It gives another reason to go and drop stuff  (and it reminds me good old Ultima Online).  There is no trading yet but I hope it will be implemented.  Only disadvantage I see is description of items...at least at the beginning.  There is no info about whether weapon is 1 or 2 handed which may be confusing a bit at first. Rating of items works differently to how I thought it should- sometimes 3 star item has worse stats than 2 star item. I found some information somewhere that it is not to compare items but to say how good rolls of stat on item are...not sure here really). Stats of items could be clearer.  There are small bits that needs fixing but overall I would highly recommend the game. Can't wait for the release day."
172231670,english,0,424370,They're shutting down the multiplayer functionality of the game instead of giving enough of a damn to give one last update for the game to run peer-to-peer or through some other method that doesn't require them hosting the servers themselves.  Don't make your multiplayer portion of your game entirely reliant on your own hosted servers if you don't know if you can host them indefinitely; it's practically worse than planned obsolescence.
90317210,english,1,424370,"Summery:  The game is absolutely playable and fun. I had 2 crashes within 120 hours of gameplay and a few minor bugs which didn’t bother me at all. It's an absolutely awesome looking and sounding ARPG with almost no limitations regarding character builds. I would totally recommend the game at its current state and price for all ARPG, H&S and RPG lovers.   Hint for Newcomers: Don’t give too much attention to the bad reviews. Most of them were disappointed bakers from the kickstarter project “Umbra”. Which is justifiable because they didn’t get what they payed for. But Wolcen is NOW a good looking completely fun ARPG. Don’t get confused by the two campaigns. Just use “Blood Trail”. It’s the same as the “Lords of Mayhem” campaign but without the bugs and including the improvements of the Blood Trail patch and the following patches. The “Lords of Mayhem” campaign is meant for old “legacy” characters only.  Hint for those who want to come back: Delete all characters which you had before the “Blood Trail” patch was released. Start from scratch with the “Blood Trail” campaign and enjoy. Since I did this: (almost) no issues during 120 hours of gameplay.  Pros: -	Dynamic gameplay -	Awesome graphics -	perfect sounds and sound design regarding positioning and quality -	no class limitations -	lots of skill variation possibilities -	well sized skill tree (wheel) -	almost infinite endgame -	the first real fireball I saw in an ARPG which is actually useful in the endgame ^^  Cons: -	linear level design -	not challenging except the boss fights -       the apocalyptic form is almost useless -	Endgame: o	becomes boring  by the time and there is no specific threat or super boss o	Not enough players for a random multiplayer session atm o	Repetitive expeditions/seats"
74096451,english,1,424370,"Overall a quite decent game with really nice graphics but not near complete with some minor to major bugs, alas I have faith that WOLCEN Studio will not disappoint in the long run. Do keep in mind that it will take some time for the Developers to finish and polish this game so if you're impatient then put the purchase on ice for now.   *I MAINLY PLAYED OFFLINE*"
63390281,english,1,424370,"I was dissappointed in my purchase of Wolcen in early access almost 2 years ago. But after setting it down and forgetting about it for a good long while, suddenly i was seeing videos pop up on youtube about all of the great changes happening to Wolcen and so I gave it another try.. Wow, have they come a long ways. I haven't had this much fun in an ARPG in a good long while, and now, a day before release and having seen all of the stuff they have planned for endgame, and moving forwards is outstanding.   The gameplay is the best part for me. The attacks feel ""weighty"" and very satisfying to use. I love the hybrid system that they have in place where I can use any combination of spells, physical attacks, ranged, attacks, etc to tailor my ""willpower dumping, rage generating, rage dumping, willpower generating"" cycling of gameplay. And that was the reason why i had so much fun leveling to 20. Whenever i found a new spell or powerful new weapon, I wasn't limited to the ""Class"" i had chosen or the playstyle i had used up till that point. I could very easily pivot and incorporate this new skill or item into my gameplay and completely switch things up. This kept things fun, fresh and interesting, and I can't wait to play the full game tomorrow :D  If you liked anything about the diablo franchise, torchlight, Path of Exile, titans quest, etc etc, definitely go watch some videos on Wolcen and give it a try. I can only speak for myself, but I have spent more hours in the Diablo games than any other (World of warcraft doesnt count, haha), and I absolutely loved my time in the beta.   Hope this helps, and good luck on your leveling journey to those of you who have already purchased the game :D"
46690896,english,1,424370,"i'm not exaggrating, this is the new diablo, wolcen take off where diablo 2 left off, not because of similarity, but because it is so damn satisfying to play this, AND the upcoming beta stuff is incredible, it will revamp the game quite noicely.  Why is this thing so good?  Everything in Wolcen is simply too fun to use, even the normal left click attacks are well made, and they have different combinations, like; pistol and sword, that's right you can actually do that, you can even get an upgrade called 'Titan' on the skill line and equip two-handed weapons as if they were one handed(yay! like in d2 barbar!), so you can use a two-handed giantass axe with a pistol like a steampunk knight it all looks so damn fine.  The glorious cryengine makes everything even better.  Entire thing looks so beautiful.  Wolcen is also super ambitious, currently it is officially known as singleplayer but the multi is in tech_beta which you can opt-in for it in the settings and try it with your friends, it obviously has bugs time to time but overall it's very promising.  Speaking of Tech_Beta, it is only for testing, it has limited gameplay, but, even with limited game the reworked spells, how they look, better looking weapons, bigger axes and stuff it all just looks so awesome..  Wolcen has a great future, and i genuinely think it will be the next Diablo 2. And in my opinion it is a great honor that many people think of wolcen as good as diablo 2 was.   Edit: Well, this aged poorly."
63755684,english,0,424370,"I really wanted to recommend this one, I really did... I had a blast with it the first couple hours, experimenting with build ideas, finding new spells, and abilities, and was even getting into the mediocre story... Then shortly after Chapter 2 started the entire game fell apart.  I want to start by saying that this game has potential, and I do like it, and I would tell you buy it in a heart beat if you're reading this months after release, and you know they have fixed the problems. I'm gonna start out with the good.  THE GOOD: - Amazing Doom/Warhammer/Diablo art style, and theme. - The most refreshing take on character skills/talents in an ARPG, or better yet RPG i've seen in a while. - Unique, and thought out spells/abilities - Limitless potential for builds. There's literally room here for anything you can think of. - Feels like the first next gen arpg on the market. (for what is actually done.) - If this studio pulls their shit together Wolcen will give the big boy arpgs a run for their money.  Now lets get into what is unacceptable about this game, and why I wont be recommending, or playing it until things change...  THE BAD:  - This game has an absolutely unacceptable amount of game breaking bugs for it to be considered a full release let alone a 40$ one. This is 1st/2nd year early access level.  -  I can't make it through a single stage without getting stuck on the floor defenseless, or without the audio cutting out. The enemies are either one punch chumps, or bullet sponges from hell.   - The difficulty ""curve"" is more like a roller coaster. One minute thinking you have a decent build to the next wanting to respec, but not being able to due to the extremely low drop rate of the currency you need to respec while leveling. I get wanting end game respec to be expensive, but while leveling the rates should be WAY lower. A skill/talent system this big takes time to get used to, and find a viable build. You should be able to fix mistakes without feeling like you are being stopped by a paywall that doesn't actually exist.  - The entire game is severely unbalanced. I've seen some builds literally go god mode on this game while others make completing the game literally impossible, and with the insane cost to respec, you better hope you do your homework, or you'll be grinding before you're half way through the story. This also isn't just due to imbalance either...   - A serious chunk of the passives just don't work period, and this doesn't help the fact that there's virtually no information in the game about what each stat does there really is no way to take chances, which I think defeats the purpose of a game like this.  - If you do play, and end up making it to the end of the first chapter, and getting your angel/mech suit thing, don't pick the reaper/chaos one, because it doesn't work. I spent an hour in the chapel/holdout stage shortly after getting it watching my character jump around the screen while that horrible computer crashing audio skip blasted my ears, only the finally be stuck casting a spell for another 2 minutes, only to be dropped dead on the floor.   - There are some awful UI bugs as well. Items being dragged under the gem window, or not being able to directly drag armor from the gem vendor window back to yourself without having to drop it in your bag first, having to click a few times here, a few times there to get the ui to respond, Oh and on Ultrawide resolutions seeing editor lighting/animation cuts off the side of the cut scenes.    All in all the 15 1/2 hours I spent with this game felt like I was working QA, or playing a new early access game. Just didn't feel like it was even to a beta stage. Late alpha at best. This would be fine if this is what the studio was selling, but it isn't. This awful habit the industry has picked up has got to stop, and it doesn't matter if it's the big AAA studios, or the underdog. I don't care if you're a small studio, or not. It's a outright deceptive practice. If development didn't go as planned, and you have backers to satisfy then do the right thing, and take the hit. Release it as an early access, make some in game goodies for the loyal fans, and release it when it's ready.  Regardless of all of that I really do hope I can come back, and change this review, and I hope the devs apologize for this launch instead of just blaming the ""server load"". That's obviously an issue, but that seems to be the patsy in this case. It seems to be more of a coding nightmare/lack of QA that is really the cause of this games issues right now."
132944580,english,1,424370,"I had this game on my wish list since it came out , but after the it came out the reception wasn't great so I didn't buy it. Over the years the game got lots of updates and it was on sale multiple times but due to mixed reviews I never pulled the trigger until it was £7.70 and at that point I though if its crap I won't even mind, but I can tell you all that is not the case. I don't know when the game got to the state it is now but I don't think there has been a better time to play it, I put 50 hours into the game before I wrote this review mostly because a lot of people are still complaining and I just don't know why? This isn't a game that you will play for the rest of your life, the campaign was a little too short I can agree with that but apparently more is to come this year and the Champion of Stormfall mode will keep you busy for a good while and its miles better that silly rifts like you get in Diablo III , to me this is one of the better ARPG's I've ever played , it actually took me away from playing Diablo II Resurrected which is not an easy thing :P all in all get it especially when the priced at £15 - £20 , you will get your moneys worth especially if you get into the Champion of Stormfall Mode :-)"
129647782,english,1,424370,"Review after finishing chapter 3 on Offline mode: If you are after a isometric action rpg with tons of loot and skills, you will enjoy this. I had a bloody fantastic time playing the game. I finished the main campaign after around 38 hours. Apart from rewarding game play it comes with excellent production values including the music, voice acting, great sound effects and graphics. (The story is even okay with a nice bit of dark drama in the 3rd chapter). I had absolutely no bugs at all during my time. The game was, gratefully, on the easier side for me, though some bosses (especially the end boss) were set at a hard, though not frustrating, level.  Especially good were the ""hunts"" side quests where you make decisions along the way whether to make rare drop rates increase at the expense of making the enemies harder. They were fun. The game has suffered a lot of early criticism and negativity, I suspect mainly from early players (who suffered with a lot of bugs) and recent players who are heavily into the game+ where maybe things such as drops and skills are causing concerns. I don't know about that yet as I am only going to play game+ for a short while and wait for the final campaign chapter to be released, so I can replay the whole game again (yes it's that good). However if you are happy to play 40 hours of really great action rpg (yes I will say it..... ""Diablo like"") then this game will not disappoint. EDIT; After playing a few hours of the game+ (Stormfall) I am just realising that there is still a ton of game to be played. You are sent on missions that help you restore Stormfell and these missions also get voice acting and new areas to play.  Bosses are now really something to contend with and you will be rethinking your character all over. I love it. There is just so much content here to still be played.  This game definitely deserves more positive reviews than the mixed review status it currently has.  Further edit: Well my review remains completely positive after finishing the chapter IV content. I have now around 100 hours in the game. The final chapter was different in presentation as compared to the first 3 but still enjoyable. The content was less a campaign and more like a series of missions. But it all concluded the story well and I was not disappointed. The cinematic scenes were top quality. You basically just got more of the core gameplay so if you were happy with that so far you will enjoy this. I still have the end game to continue with and I am still motivated enough to continue for the foreseeable future. This game is a solid 8/10 BUT.... it must be played offline. Online is a complete disaster."
88610662,english,1,424370,"I wanted to play this game since release but waited because of the bad state of the game at release.  I'd been wondering when would be the right time to buy it because despite this, in context they ran out of money for their kickstarter.  Far more important to me though was that someone finally made an ARPG which isn't trying to be a straight Diablo or POE clone.  To me, innovation and willingness to be different is huge, especially in what I think is a stale genre which is ready to evolve.  First and foremost, if you're deciding whether to play this game, my advice is to set your expectations as if this were a brand new game for where the content and polish currently is.  Forget that it came out over a year ago now.  It's a very, very fun game IMO, but think of it as a fresh new game that needs time to grow out still.  I've also only been playing single player offline so far.  So...where is it now?  This is the question and the review I'd wanted to read before I bought but couldn't find.  It's hard to read past all the negativity and complaining about the game still.  The great: The action and gameplay in this game feel INCREDIBLE.  This is the biggest thing for me.  I sadly have not been able to get in to POE despite its popularity and vast amount of content because the game just does not feel good to me.  Wolcen feels almost like a hybrid of a brawler and an ARPG.  The hits have weight, weapons have different swings that you actually need to take in to account when using them.  Simply fighting with your regular weapon swings is fun, where as most APRGs it feels like you click enemies to death and ability spam.  I thought the campaign, story, and characters were *very* well written and I'm honestly surprised.  I actually cared about the characters and where the story was going.  The stats, itemization, and skill tree feel like a work in progress but are currently in a very playable and fun state still.  This is another area where I personally am giving it a ton of bonus points because, again, they have opted to not run your boring standard ARPG stat system.  At every level this game is trying to make it so that theoretically every stat can work with any class archetype you choose, and there are not nearly as many arbitrary limits on what gear or skills you can use.  The game pretty much lets you wear and equip whatever you want, the only limitation is whether you can make it work, and the game tries very hard to give you the most flexibility possible in how you accomplish that.  It is so nice to play a game where necessarily intelligence/wisdom = magic, agile = rogue/ranged, etc........even the skill trees themselves offer something for everyone in the majority of cases.  The graphical quality, art style, and animations are superb.  THE BAD, as I see it: -The worst thing for me is that the tooltips are very poorly worded and there are too many unexplained mechanics.  It's kind of bizarre actually, considering how good the writing is for everything else in the game.  It makes it harder to know what you're getting when theorycrafting or comparing items and skills -Everyone writes about bugs with this game.  I played through the campaign two full times and have been doing their endgame mode here for a while.  It's only crashed to desktop twice for me, and once I had to restart the game because it was acting wonky.  Twice I got a weird graphical bug that meant I had to quit to main menu and load again.  That's it. -*I haven't tried it myself yet* but everything I hear is that there are still some game disrupting bugs when playing MP, and at this time there is no matchmaking.    Conclusion: I love this game.  I hope Diablo 4 takes some notes from this game.  I do not say this lightly.  Part of the reason I'd waited on this game, aside from bugs, is that I was afraid that development would freeze or worse the studio would go under.  Instead, they've started posting development updates talking about upcoming content.  They promised regular patches starting in 2021 and thus far have delivered.  They even were able to hire a couple of extra people to work on the game!  I'm not ready to pause on the game yet but I see myself coming back to this game every time there is new content."
64265366,english,1,424370,"I was (and still am hesitant) to write a review for such a controversial game, but, probably 3 people will ever read this, so here goes...  Caveats: Never played an ARPG before. Saw the hype, took a chance on a genre I have no prior experience with.  PLAY OFFLINE:  I hit up offline first without much thought. I had a great gaming experience all the way up and into end game content. Really enjoyed it.  ONLINE: About 9 days after I bought this thing, I decided to try the online mode. Once there, I started to see why all the negative reviews are popping up. This dev team isn't ready for online, is my guess. I got in after a game update or two, so I missed the worst of it. Had some bugs that blocked progress coming into ACT 3, managed to work around them. That said, they shouldn't have been there in the first place.   So IF... this game looks appealing to you, and you like to play alone, buy it, and run offline mode. You will have a blast. Online is better than at release, but I can't see the future, You are on your own if online play is a requirement for you."
140910444,english,1,424370,"So I really like the GFX, the skills, the enemies, the combat. The voice overs are great, campaign is actually a good story - cut scenes are real nice. I haven't played long yet but i come here as a Veteran D2 Player, D3, D4, POE, Etc.  What I like about Wolcen is that it launched as a terrible failure 3 years ago but the team didn't give up. They have been working diligently for free since then. In an age where goliath companies like Blizzard produce over-priced garbage, i believe in the under-dog studio. Wolcen's team is trying REALLY hard to continuously improve this game with free updates and patches. I think if we stick around this will eventually be a top ARPG - it has all the right stuff to reach that level."
49815946,english,0,424370,"I want this game to succeed, but so far that is just not happening. (Please understand before assuming I'm just crapping on the game, I have a lot of time invested into it on several accounts to assist with testing things pretty heavily.)  For those that just want a short answer; I cannot recommend this game currently.  I helped Kickstart this game back when it was still named Umbra. The vision of the game back then was such a different scope than what we have gotten to now, and not in a good way. The developers honestly became extremely lazy mid-development and just decided to start copying every other ARPG on the market rather than stick to their own style and promises. There are so many aspects to why this game is failing currently even though they have now rushed a beta together to try and save-face.   1. The developers pretty much completely ignore the community.  From the start, they had a website/forums where the initial place to report bugs and give feedback was. This started out ok for the first few months of development but slowly you could watch the forum become abandoned by the developers and team of the game. Massive bugs, exploits, glaring issues etc. all started going completely ignored. When I confronted the lead developer about this, he told me ""we don't really bother with the forums anymore, we use the Steam community instead"". Yes, he literally said that. No announcement or anything on the official site, or even just closing it down, they just let people shout into the void with their bug reports and feedback all of which was completely ignored still to this day. (There are massive bugs in this game that to this day still exist that are reported on the original forums.)  Soon after, they started doing the same with the Steam forums, becoming less and less active and less engaged in the community. And again, it turned into a new place to be, Discord. Where they hardly ever talk, and never listen to the feedback.  2. They abandoned their own game in favor of copying other ARPGs.  During the alpha, the game was focused on being a unique experience for an ARPG while still having the traditional aspects you come to expect in one. This was going pretty solid for a while, we got fairly regular updates with some various new features to check out. However, this suddenly changed when massive changes happened in the team where people were fired/laid off to a point where there was only like 2 people left on the team. We got very little information about what was going on and we got a new update that basically broke the entire game for a while.  They shifted focus on their original ideas at this point to basically just stay afloat. The original alpha act 1 was scrapped and was replaced with a very lacking piece of content. Then some new hires were added and more promises began rolling in.   Fast forward to a few months ago, they completely ditched the entire game. They gave up on their own concepts and ideas, and instead completely copied Diablo 3, in almost every possible aspect. They redid everything, but used all of Diablo's ideas instead of being original and having their own game. You logged into this new alpha and were presented with a new title screen copied exactly from Diablo. The entire game mode available at this point was Diablo inspired. Skills, graphics, animations, loot, etc. were all redone to be more like existing ARPGs. The entire skill tree system was disabled in favor of a 'revamp' which turned into a clone of PoE with very minimal unique parts. New mobs were added that were literal copies of Diablo mobs (models look exactly like D3 things (ie the Butcher), the mob skills were clones of things from Diablo, etc.)  3. Massive game breaking bugs still exist, to this day.  There are a lot of massive bugs in this game that have been there since day one. These bugs have been reported multiple times across all mediums (official forums, official bug reporting setup, official Steam community and the official Discord) all of which just got ignored or simply deemed 'unfixable'.   There is a huge bug due to how the world loads because the developers do not understand how to properly handle thread synchronization. This game loads various aspects of the world during a loading screen in different threads. All fine and great for optimization, however they have no locking or syncing mechanisms in place to deal with the order things complete or when the game assumes it's ready. This means there is chance every single time you hit a loading screen that you will fall through the floor.   Here is a quote from one of the developers from a pm I had with on Discord. This was me reiterating the issue of falling through the floors in the game. (This convo was back at the beginning of the year when they released the Diablo 3 clone version of the alpha.)  ""There might be, CryEngine have a worker thread system to run some things away from the main thread. But tbh, we'r a small team and we'r making such an ambitious game (ARPG are hard..... so many game mechanics & systems... it's great and horrible at the same time as a programmer ^^) that I don't think we'll have time to take a look into this before release""  I'm not trying to out a developer or have any ill-will towards them, but this is a huge problem that wasn't new. It's been in the game from the start and is still there now. You can also cause this bug to happen in other ways by running against walls and other jagged surfaces that are blocking like walls. Eventually you will start to slowly fall into the floor, causing the camera to go absolutely insane while moving. Soon enough you'll fall through the floor or your position will never correct itself until you restart the game.  There are other massive bugs like this in the game too. Such as loot drops falling through the floor or landing up in unreachable places. Potions not reacting properly on the current 'tick' of the game, causing you to die because it'll trigger the cooldown but not heal you until the next tick and so on. This are massive glaring problems in an ARPG that are not going to fly when a lot more people start playing and finding the same problems.  ---  I really want this game to succeed. We need more ARPGs to exist and help continue to push the genre forward, but right now Wolcen is not that special thing it once was when they first announced it.   Right now, it feels more like a beta test of an unannounced Diablo 3 clone made by fans.   I do not recommend this game for the time being. I highly recommend people save their money until the Wolcen team really gets back into their own grove and starts making their own game.   To the developer I talked with, I'm sure you'll see my name and recognize me based on our in depth chat. I mean no ill-will towards you or the team. I want this game to be amazing. But for me, your current direction is not one I feel is going to make this game popular or successful outside of a small niche of people. Please take a step back and realize copying Diablo is not how to make a successful ARPG."
78320072,english,0,424370,"This game is a gross far cry of what was originally sold to backers during the Kickstarter. Originally touted as going to be an open world role-playing game with an isometric view, quests out in the world, exploration, and more. A diablo version of Skyrim. Instead we got a buggy b-rate version of Diablo with an edgy story and art that looks like a tryhard-Chinese version of the Warhammer aesthetic. Absolutely embarrassing."
64256373,english,1,424370,"There were definitely some annoying bugs on release, most all of them have been fixed (at least the one I personally encountered) but beyond that its a really fun next gen ARPG."
66703156,english,0,424370,"Wolcen is like a dish that's made with an excellent recipe using the finest ingredients.  The problem is that the dish was taken out of the oven way too soon. Most of the customers left the restaurant after being served a half baked mush and the confused chefs don't know if it's too late to put the food back into the oven.  [h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1] - Gorgeous visuals and decent animations - Environments are detailed, however could use more map variety - Servicable voice acting - Fun combat system - Dynamic class system, which allows your char to respec into anything and change your playtyle while in the city. - Certain skills are a lot of fun. - Story is alright up to Act II.  [h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1] - Act III is horrible - The game is unfinished - No real end content: Item and monster go up to 187 but you pretty much do the same once you beat the story. - End game dungeon modifiers are ridiculously unbalanced: some of them are too easy, while some of them make a run close to unbeatable  - Certain passive skills don't work as intended, and some of them just straight out don't work"
84692086,english,1,424370,"For months I've wanted to buy Wolcen and have put it off because of the negative reviews and general opinion online that it is a buggy mess. I bit the bullet during the winter sale and so far I have been absolutely blown away. It is everything I was looking for in terms of a new ARPG. The combat feels great and the visuals are pretty. The progression systems strike kind of a balance between Diablo 3 and Path of Exile. The abilities are simplified and accessible but there is an expansive passive skill tree for tailoring your build.  In terms of bugs I've gotten some occasional texture pop-in and glitched audio, but everything has been very minor. So far I haven't experienced any of the game breaking issues that other people have reported, but I'll edit my review if I do later. Either way I've already got my money's worth from this game and I would gladly recommend it to other ARPG fans."
63434878,english,1,424370,"I'm a dad, in my 30's now and don't have much time dedicated to gaming. So when I pick a game, I feel I have to choose it wisely. I'm very very glad I purchased this one. First steam review I've ever done. One of my favorites is Grim Dawn. This is now equal to that and I've only played the first couple of hours.   The graphics, diversity of spells, spell graphics (important to me) and the way the combat feels/looks is just perfect. Really great job, devs. I'm gonna spend a ton of my free time on this one!  EDIT: You absolutely should not purchase this game as of 2.19.2020.  It's important to know that this game is not in a playable/enjoyable state at the moment. My initial review was based on open beta game play after 3 hours. Once launched, the game was quickly taken offline for 3 days due to unexpected database issues due to a massive influx of new players. There are so many bugs that many consider game breaking and it's flat not worth $40.   Bugs that you will encounter as of this review: Loot/Stash disappearing, Item/gold duplication, unable to basic attack certain mobs, end game monsters not dropping any loot, damage modifiers not actually modifying any damage, potential for complete character wipe and completely bricking your game open completing final act boss.   *Before you purchase, please go to the /r/Wolcen subreddit on Reddit and look up the current state of the game. You've been warned. Come back a year from now and I'm sure the game will be great."
57229570,english,1,424370,"[i] DISCLAIMER [/i]: I backed this game back in 2015, played here and there during it's changes, I liked some of the changes and didn't like others. This game is much different in 2019 than it was then, and most of the negative reviews are based on that. As you can see I'm approaching 200hrs played in early access, and I might just hit that mark before release because of how enjoyable I have found the game, especially the recent patches. I'll layout my pros and cons for what is currently available and then my optimism for what is coming.  [h1] Pros [/h1] -[u] Visceral action: [/u] This is an ARPG, and you want to feel the impact of your skills when killing enemies, and I feel Wolcen does a very good job here. I've mostly been playing melee and ranged builds, haven't really dabbled in magic yet, but the attacking skills are hefty and satisfying. I'll also add that the audio for the skills is great, and I particularly love the ""plug plug plug"" sound of the auto-turrets.  -[u] Itemization: [/u] Loot, loot and more loot! What more can you want from a hack and slash looter? Starting out lvl 1 in the campaign each found item is a treasure, wondering if it's an item that fits into what you are planning to play or you find something that completely alters your plan because it's better or build defining in this classless system. Once you start finding rares and uniques the game really kicks up! But once you start finding legendaries, oh boy do the min-maxing demons come out, and I love em'!!! So far in this iteration of the game these red items, basically rares on steroids, are often best in slot, and the grind to get them is a ton of fun. Anything red that drops on the screen is a potential small to huge upgrade for your character or another build, and then sometimes; but as with any game looter, there's the chance that item just rolled all the wrong affixes and is useless.   -[u] Skills: [/u] I mentioned above how I felt the skills are visceral, and you feel their impact. Here I would just like to mention that I feel the current group of skills we have access to (24 in total) are pretty darn good. The animations and artwork of the skills is great, and I do love the rune system that is in place. For those who are reading this review having not yet played the game, so far each skill lvls up to 20 (same as current level cap) and you have 20 points to allocate between the associated runes for the skill. Some runes cost 4 points (minor) and some cost 8 (major), and this will determine how you use the skill compared to another player using the same skill. It's fun and allows for a lot of build variation.  -[u]Passive Tree: [/u] The Tree has 3 rings (2 at the moment) in the first ring there are your basic ""class archetypes""; soldier, sentinel (rogue) and a mage one (forgot the name). The next ring has 6 ""sub classes"" and these are where you start to get builds being defined. The 6 branches of the second ring are the: Assassin (dodging, single target dmg), Ranger (projectiles and ranged attacks), Elementalist? (elemental damage duh), Cabalist (damage over time oriented), Warmonger (physical damage), alongside the Praetorian (tanky boi). Now the really cool thing about these rings is that they are not stationary, so you aren't stuck going in one path or needing to spend 10 points just to get to your desired 2nd ring, you can rotate the rings to set them up the most efficient way for your build!   -[u] Attributes: [/u] You gain attribute points per lvl that can be put into Ferocity, Toughness, Agility and Wisdom. You will find yourself sometimes doing a little mixing and matching to perhaps hit break points, or your build might only require you to dump all points into one. It's dealer’s choice sometimes and is often very dependent on gear you find and certain passives you may have chosen. Wolcen is finding a nice happy, and functional medium blending attributes, passives and itemization together.   -[u] Campaign [/u]: I found the first act to be rat her enjoyable, and the story to be easy to follow and so far, well thought out. The art and environments are great. Not the open world that the game used to have, but I do not find it detracts from the gameplay that much. Looking forward to Acts 2 and 3 on launch (hope they have a bit more content than Act 1), and the following Acts that are to be FREE DLC.   -[u] Soldier of Fortune and Wrath of Sarisel: [/u] So these are the current endgame content for the game. [b] Soldier of fortune [/b] you get to push higher and higher monster levels with the incentive of increased loot drop quality and quantity. You can add modifiers to these runs to make it more difficult but increase the reward. in SoF loot drops from everything, but you don't get the ""reward"" until you've completed 5 runs.  For [b] Wrath of Sarisel [/b], when making an SoF run, once you add all the modifiers you can lure ""tainted"" monsters that will chase you down and do what they can to kill you. These guys are basically assassins that can really mess you up. These runs are a mix of speed and kill runs, as you want to clear mobs as quickly as possible to kill the bosses so you can get a high rank at the end of the run, I believe that the higher the rank the better the loot (doesn't always seem to be the case). However, these runs offer loot that doesn't drop elsewhere. Loot from these runs can roll affixes like a Bow allowing you to use the melee oriented Bladestorm (Whirlwind). This affix might be cool and interesting, but maybe not useful. But finding a shield or a sword that allows you to use spell casting skills as a melee character can be build RE-defining.   -[u] Social/Trading: [/u] The big thing though is you can trade anything and everything with your friends. Even if you found something while playing solo, you can give that to your buddy who is just starting out. I don't mind a system like this, I prefer it over nothing, or something so limited its frustrating (D3 trading...blech).  [h1] Cons [/h1] -[u] Skills: [/u] some skills I found we very slow to cast, like Arrows Wail, which is hail of arrows type skill, and the casting time for the skill seems a bit long as enemies tend to be able to close the gap during the cast time. This may just be due to my lack of play time with the skill and build style as I've mostly been playing melee builds. So, take that with a grain of salt.   -[u] Lag and Loading: [/u] Right now Wolcen seems to be pretty CPU intensive, generally once in-game it isn't too bad, but sometimes when starting a run or going to the next level it takes too long and some monsters show up and slowly start beating on me to the point I end dying at the start.  -[u] Bugs: [/u] It is early access, there are bug. My review is very long now so go look in the forums for the bugs.   [h1] Future Content: [/h1]  For this I would really suggest going to their website ([url=store.steampowered.com] https://wolcengame.com/ [/url] to see what they have planned as I have gone on quite a bit so far and I would just be copy-pasta-ing everything anyway.  If you like Hack and Slash ARPGs the likes of Diablo, you can find enjoyment here. I'd recommend picking it up if it goes on sale before release (January 2020 if they are still on track!), if it doesn't then maybe just wait until it is released if you don't feel like being limited to lvl 20 (lvl 90 is the cap on release).  Current state, I give this early access version a 7/10. Again, I'm giving this a 7/10 as an early access game. I'm not giving a fully developed and launched game a 7/10 because that is not what that is...sometimes people seriously forget that when reviewing or reading reviews of early access games. I hope to update this on release, and I hope I can give the fully released version of Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem a 7/10 or better!  Thank you for your time, Flyhumpy"

168131604,english,0,424370,I understand abandoning a project. But not allowing your players to enjoy multiplayer? Peer to Peer or releasing a server API. Instead just nothing. Big lol.
172377285,english,1,424370,"I have a little history with Wolcen ,i tried it a few years ago and my computer had some problems,here on steam this is my second experience with this game.   Unfortunately my review comes at a time when developpers announced their plan to end the support for multiplayer and endgame content however there's enough content in the single player campaign and to be honest i was interested only in that. The after grind is not for me and there are better alternatives for that.  If you never heard of this game there are similar games like Path of Exiles or Diablo series,this can be a great choice if you're interested in action rpgs with dungeon crawling and loot-based progression.  I really liked the dark fantasy theme and visually the game is a feast for the eyes and for my surprise the voice acting was great for this kind of game. After some browsing i discovered popular voice actors from games i played before like dragon age or witcher 3.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311461899  In terms of gameplay everything was smooth with no major issues or bugs.. the movement was fluid and the dodge/roll responsive. With a huge arsenal of spells and combinations of talent trees you can create a unique character, featuring a classless system Wolcen doesn't lock you into a specific class !   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311376207  Another mechanic i enjoyed was the Apocalyptic Form, this transforms you into avatars with unique and powerful abilities ,there are multiple avatars you can unlock each with its own theme. Beyond the cool factor and amazing visuals there are strategic advantages during though battles or boss fights.  At this point in time i can only recommend this if you're looking for the single player content, for a great price during a sale of course.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311467285  Pros: - Great story with twists and betrayals - Voice acting  - Visuals  Cons: - If you want more than single player campaign,read the negative reviews  My review score  Story - 9 Gameplay- 8  Graphics- 8 Sound - 9  Overall - 8.5"
63504300,english,0,424370,"Right now the game just feels unpolished and I cant tell if its because of the servers being under strain and things feel laggy or its just the way the game is but combat often feels unresponsive and choppy, attacks dont connect the way you expect them to not to mention the unit collision can make things super frustrating at times.   There is also a problem of skills not giving you enough information about what they actually do and how they scale and all the information given is usually very vague such as ""increases damage dealt by summons"" but it doesnt give you a number and from what I can tell you cant see it in the stats of the summons either. Status ailments are also hard to keep track of since there is no indicator on an enemy telling you what they are afflicted by and how many stacks youve put on them and similar things happen all over the game with things being very obscured and unclear for no real reason.  Last of all is just a personal complaint since I am going for a summoner build but the AI for the summons is ridiculously bad 70% of the time they just sit behind me and do nothing, the charge command for the zombie summons rarely ever work they either get stuck on you, each other, the terrain or on thin air. there is also nothing in the game that tells you if your summons scale of things like youre status ailment chance or if they calculate their own stats separately from yours. You also completely lack any form of indicator of how many summons you currently have so you have to manually keep track of them at all times which feels like a huge step backwards from every other ARPG ive played.   TLDR: I do enjoy the build diversity and experimentation the game offers you but I can not recommend it as it is now because the unresponsive and unreliable combat system holds it back.  Edit: There are alot of really butthurt people commenting on this review deciding to ignore the fact that the game is getting more and more negative reviews by the hour and that the game is not flawless and that alot of the problems are personal opinion and thoughts. Neither am I attacking or discrediting the devs in any way and I know they are working to improve the game but that doesnt mean i will recommend the game until these issues are addressed."
65543844,english,0,424370,"Update: I have re-downloaded the game as of August 7th ([u]after 5 months[/u]) and here are some of the things i noticed.  [b]Bugs, bugs, and more bugs.[/b]  I started a new character to see what has changed.... 1. The server capacity is only at 1k now, so anytime it goes over the limit, the server will shut down.(yes wolcen lost 98% of the player base, so they downgraded their servers to the limit before release.) This is what happens with a bad launch, or releasing a game that was not ready. When will gaming companies learn? First impressions matter and you can't redeem yourself after a bad launch. 2. As i played through the beginning of act one again, there was an audio bug of squishy corpse noises that wouldn't stop playing and it was annoying as hell to the point where i had to go to settings and turn the effects volume off. 3. Things disappeared in the chests. 4. Offline character randomly deleted. 5. I still sometimes get stuck in objects, but not as often as i did before. 6. Playing as a ranged character, the hit boxes are still janky or sometimes it doesn't register. 7. I got stuck in a loading screen for 10 minutes after ACT 1 transitioning to ACT 2. 8. There is still some latency issues here and there, but it definitely was not as bad as before. 9. I wasn't able to test online because i couldn't find anyone online to play with... everyones gone, what do you expect. But last i played the LAG was BAD. 10. While going through act one, sometimes the quests don't register and i got stuck in a map and had to go through the other maps again for the quests to register correctly.  WILL UPDATE AS I PROGRESS FURTHER OR FIND NEW PROBLEMS.  [b]SKILLS AND BALANCE[/b]   Will update when i'm higher level.   [b]Armor and Weapons[/b]  1. Legendaries are still useless... 2. Seems as if armor doesn't make as much of an impact as your passive skill tree.  Will update more as i progress.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This game lost 127k players within the first month of release. That should tell you how terrible the developers are at making decisions. They make decisions to satisfy them and not the player base. They do not listen to feedback and usually deletes them.  If you even look closer, the people who have the top reviews didn't continue playing after they reviewed. Because after the game released, the first patch destroyed the game, the second patch nerfed skills and took ALL players hard earned money away whether you were a cheater or not, (because they couldn't catch who did or did not cheat), which caused mass amount of players to quit since they lost their hours upon hours of grinded money.   The last time i played wolcen was a few weeks ago, ever since they've completely nerfed everything, and haven't balanced the skills, the game has become unplayable. They'll keep nerfing skills people find a good build on to help clear the maps faster.  The game itself was already very grindy if you didn't cheat, but now they've nerfed all skills and made the required materials to upgrade items 2 - 4 times more is just ridiculous.   I just wanted a game where i could enjoy hack and slashing mindlessly and enjoy the loot drops, but rare loot drops are almost non-existent at this point because of the nerfing.   If diablo lets players 1 hit everything and clear through the map fast and enjoy their way of grinding, why can't the developers of Wolcen do it? The answer is, they don't want players to have fun.   The result: they've lost 95% of the player base as of today. You will not find anyone to be able to play with because majority of the people has quit. Personally, I'm not going to go back and waste my time on the game anymore till a year later when they've finally fixed the game.   Wolcen studio, here's an advice: to keep your player base, LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR WISHES. Don't DELETE US AND BAN US FROM DISCORD BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE OUR SUGGESTIONS.  I wouldn't be surprised if their servers are not up anymore in a month or two. Wolcen studio has destroyed themselves and the player base. Do not support them and give them your money. Who ever is making all the decisions in this game should be fucking fired."
70830944,english,0,424370,"Great looking game, great feeling game.  The issue I had is that the game provides you barely any numbers for your spells and abilities.  Descriptions such as ""Your attacks may cause lightning to chain foes""  No proc chance, no damage number for the lightning, just fucking guess.  So I thought, you know what they got a great game here, fun to play, they just gotta fill in some blanks.  Was I dead wrong!!! They are making an expansion!?!?!?!  They didn't even give you fucking spell descriptions yet, and they have the godamned nerve to make an expansion!?  WTF is wrong with these people.  Pro tip, some player love to know what their characters abilities do, we don't need act 4 to this mess, just fix your game please!!!!"
97110792,english,0,424370,"TLDR: Wolcen at this current point in time is still half baked. They have made good progress since launch, but it still has a very long way to go. As of right now, endgame is bugged and the story is not finished yet, and due to this i cannot recommend this game. THIS DOES NOT MEAN, I WANT THE DEVS TO GIVE UP.  I want to love this game. The foundations that the devs have laid are quite solid. Skills are fun to use, changing builds is super easy, the transmog system and dye system is super easy and you can always keep yourself looking good, and the endgame systems they have set up promise a good time.   Thats the problem though, the games foundations are solid, and the ideas are good, but there are too many bugs and issues holding the game back. During my play through (most of which was done co-op with a friend), we experienced a couple of bugs through the story, one of which forced us to replay an entire section (thankfully an earlier section) because his character did not get the completion flag to trigger on his account.  Another bug we encountered that was VERY annoying, was in chapter 3. we were experiencing a really weird bug where our characters and animations were all moving/playing in full speed, but it was as if our characters were getting stuck in the floor and the game was having a hard time trying to figure out where we were, thus forcing us to move in super slow motion, EVEN WHEN NO ENEMIES COULD POSSIBLY BE DEBUFFING US.  Then we have the issues with endgame, currently there is a huge bug where if you are in a mandate OR expedition, sometimes when you open your inventory, skill screen, or passive screen, it boots you out of the mandate/expedition completely and kills the portal, completely resetting your progress. It is completely random WHICH screen does it when it decides to happen, but it happens frequently enough that i have only been able to complete 3 mandates and 2 expeditions.  I have also encountered bugs in expeditions that render the boss immune to all sources of damage, hits simply not registering at all. I know this is a bug, as the boss was not IN a damage immune phase. no numbers were even popping up, yet their model was flashing as though it was getting hit and my internet connection was perfectly fine. (on top of that, i was able to fully recreate the issue in offline mode where internet is a non-issue)  Then we have the story. The story just started to get interesting in chapter 3, annnnnd it ends on a cliffhanger.   Due to all of the issues stated above, i cannot recommend this game to anyone quite yet. I ABSOLUTELY DO ACKNOWLEDGE that the dev team has made progress, good progress, but its not done yet, and i do hope that they continue to improve upon, and expand what they have.  I want this game to succeed, as stated in the beginning, i love all of the ideas they have, its just not ready yet."
67819670,english,0,424370,"I have spent 465 hours on game and I feel like I am in position to let you know if you should buy it or not.  Short answer - Do not buy it!  The lack of communication from these developers is outstanding. We dont know the roadmaps, nor what is being fixed or worked on. They seem to neglect priority of fixing servers completely which are very broken and dsyfunctional for multiplayer experience.  The neglect is very obvious even in their own discord channels which are being polluted by dupers and real $ sellers. And they really dont do anything about it. (And on funny note after helping and twitching for their community they banned me without a reason).  The dupping in wolcen is disaster. To this day nothing has been done. But can you blame dupers not really... The whole crafting system as one friend put it to me, is worse then winning a national lottery. Without dupers selling gears you would never be able to craft perfect or close to perfect gears. The whole crafting system is one massive joke.  The game is alpha state there is very little content to do apart of experimenting with builds and griding level 90. In order to reach level 90 you would need to spend around a year in game, its worse then grinding in MMO.  I could go on but just take a look at bug reporting section or jump on discords and you will see how the game has failed the community and declining very fast.  The only good thing was the story and single player experience till you finish it but its not worth the price they ask, nor your time. Just wait for diablo. These guys made something unique but they executed on it poorly. They dont know how to manage community nor they know how to run servers."
186158338,english,0,424370,Developer couldn't complete this game and abandoned it. Just becasue they released it and called it 1.0 doesnt at all mean it was. Then very shortly after announce another arpg. Took customers money and threw them away. Don't fall for it again.
32153912,english,1,424370,"So....I had originally given this game a poor review but after sinking some more time into it I have begun to really really be excited about it.   Realize that if you get the game now there isnt too much content. That is the one thing I would want to impress on anyone thinking of getting the game now. It is still early access.  ~~~AS OF NOW~~~ ~~~~~THE GOOD~~~~~ I am in love with the skill set of a few of the characters. The POE-like style of the skill tree is fantastic...but unlike POE you dont have to follow a straight line with it. There are very few restrictions in terms of where you can go. Keeping in mind that there are only half of the tree available at this point and a lvl 20 cap I am pretty hyped about what else I can do in the game.  The skill graphics are dazzling. I dont use that word very often but I will in this case. I am really enjoying the way it is all put together and having a ton of fun grinding already.   It seems to be getting updated and patched regularly.   I really think this will give POE and D3 a run for their money and Im happy I found it early on to see how it gets develped over time.   ~~~~~THE NOT SO GOOD~~~~~ Content. I really wish there was more to do in the game. Ive been grinding away at capped level hunting for really mediocre gear (the usual progression of white gear, blue gear, yellow gear) and it seems that yellow gear is as high as its gotten. I suppose this isnt as much a complaint as it is a desire for more.  Bugs. The game crashes for me occasionally and has quite a few random movement bugs. It is a little clunky in a few ways but again...it is early access and is to be somewhat expected at this stage.  ~~~~~IN THE END~~~~~ Would I recommend you get this. Yes. I would not expect a very polished game though. If you want to get into a great game early and see it all come together over time...this is it.  I am really excited to see what becomes of this game and look forward to some sleepless nights~"
63701725,english,0,424370,"passive nodes that don't work, passive nodes that are overtuned, stashes and characters disappearing, and all the server downtime, but what are the devs' top priority?  Banning everyone who duped gold using a bug that was reported YEARS ago.  The attributes nerf coming out of the claimed ""beta"", cause let's face it this game is still in beta, is just one of the many unbelievable things this release botched. Defensives removed, leveling makes you weaker, and adding attributes tops off what you are focusing on (crit, att speed< ailment chance or hp/shield), but weakens the rest? What?  Apparently game is as playable as it was 4-5 years ago, and they spent this time transferring it to another engine and rewriting some code so it fit the engine, and no progress was made in making the game actually work. Then again, this sounds so absurd so do your own research about this if it makes or breaks your purchase.  The game looks fun and plays quite well at the starting stages and despite alot of build whining online you can make any build work all the way to the end of the campaign, because killing bosses is really learning their mechanics more than a dps race  before the reality kicks in that your build is worthless in endgame (yes i played lightning mage and later found out more than half my nodes, mostly the spell damage ones, do not work)  Oh, and did i mention that certain endgame mechanics (i.e the Dark Market) bricks your game?   Story is what you would expect out of an ARPG, something demons/devils, something angels, character is blessed/cursed and is called to action etc etc.  You will have fun for the first few hours, in awe of the graphics and the unique rotating skill tree. If you are willing to spend the game's full price (34 SGD for me) for ""a few hours of fun"", then go for it.   Otherwise, dont even look at this game. I heard Grim Dawn is on sale."
73283758,english,0,424370,"I've Been Tricked, I've Been Backstabbed and I've Been Quite Possibly, Bamboozled!  C'mon WOLCEN Studios, it's 2020, man. You guys know better than to do this to us. We're so hungry for a good ARPG, and to not be able to make this pre-beta game actually full release quality after 5 months post-launch, and AFTER you've already taken our money is an absolute disgrace. ""But we're working hard to fix the bugs!"", yeah, we get it. But that's what closed alpha/ beta tests are for, to get the bugs worked out...instead, we unwittingly paid you a whopping $39.99 to beta test your game. Launches like this, and dodgy attempts at quelling the outrage with empty promises of patches and content really make me miss the good old days of buying a physical game at a store. It was a tangible summation of painstaking hours of coding and testing that was crisp, clean, and very rarely had game-breaking bugs. Developers tested the hell out of their product to deliver something to the gaming population that they were proud of. WOLCEN Studios, what do you have to be proud of with this game?"
64627880,english,0,424370,"So 200+ hours into the game, and  to be honest I hate writing reviews, but I can't keep my frustration at bay any longer. It has all been said before. The game is utterly broken with all the bugs. Some of the bugs I don't mind but for me the crazy frustration are things like backtracking through an entire map just to kill the last rat and then go ALL the way through the entire map to kill the boss. Not a bug, just an insanely hair ripping experience. Did they fix the life regeneration of bosses in 1.08. NO they didn't, welcome to another boss that instantly heal destroying the run. Most of the time when you get one shotted you will have no idea where it comes from, and it will happen often on higher levels unless you are crazy geared, or using some broken skills/exploits. The game is not optimized for dodging and many times you have no chance to avoid the attacks, dying while you panic press the button that suppose to save you. I play offline on a very good gaming rig and yet I die over and over again to retarded programming, it is beyond frustrating. Planning to do a lot of crafting, well not in Wolcen. The crafting materials are the most uncommon items in the game, and even with help from the marked you will chew through your very small stack of materials in mere seconds most likely not getting what you want. I do love the game, because it could have been so good, and yet they choose to put a beta on the marked most likely due to financial reasons, and yes it was a smart decision money wise, because people were hungry for a new hack & slash and bought the unfinished product but it could have been so much better. On one side I hope they will get it all fixed in time, but on the other side I also hope they take the money and retire so I can uninstall this @#@# from my hard drive, especially since I don't have any hair left."
142638044,english,1,424370,"Thoroughly enjoyed this. I was playing this concurrently with Diablo 4 and found myself playing this more. I played as a sorcerer in offline mode and nothing felt like a grind as it does in D4. Combat is fun and the spells have decent variety. I had the most fun with 3 summons and an OP annihilation beam.   You can pause the game unlike D4, which is super handy as i have a toddler running around and i can simply resume where i was without getting killed or logged off. All in all i am satisfied and will replay this. It was an absolute steal for only 10 dollars.  in comparison I paid 150$ for D4 ultimate edition and am mostly disappointed, i should have just watched the cut scenes online and called it a day."
179202736,english,0,424370,Not even the will to offer local co:op or dedicated servers to play with friends. They just shutdown the servers and ripped money from alot of people which bought a online co:op game to enjoy. Thanks for the Scam.
45904456,english,1,424370,"As you may have noticed, this is a very polarizing game. By buying it, you have access to an early version of the game. You want an full-fledged experience right at this moment? Then don't buy it now. You want to support a possibly great game and provide feedback? Then go for it. The devs have taken the risky steps to recreate almost entirely the underlying systems that define the game (every dev dreams of this) and from what I have seen during the (short, technical) beta, it paid out. The game looks sharper, the gameplay way more responsive and this is a very good base to build content on.  Now do I recommend this game? This is clearly too soon to say. Diablo 3 was looking pretty good during beta and see where it is now. There are many game design choices that can kill a game beyond just core gameplay. We have no idea how loot or build dynamics will play out in the endgame, or the amount of content we'll have. And we will probably not know until late in beta or after release.  I'm leaving a positive review (for now) and I urge you to ignore trolls who still don't undertand what Early Access is meant to be. Now to WOLCEN Studio, don't disappoint ;)"
75628623,english,0,424370,"As a primarily ARPG player coming from Grim Dawn and Diablo 3 , I will try to review this game on it's ARPG parameters equivalent.  Graphics : Hand's down the best in any ARPG. Graphics are extremely beautiful. Locations are varied but very linear, similar to Diablo 3.  Core Gameplay : Now , the skills we use in this game are similar to Orbs from Path of Exile (POE) , called Enneracts in this game. This skills have their own modifiers when you level up however some of the modifiers are pretty bland and boring.  Modifiers such as ""Increased damage"" or ""Increased critical hit chance"" adds no variety at all. Such modifiers should come with unique weapons rather than an modifier upgrade itself. Right now the meta is ailment stacking and almost everyone runs this play style for maximum damage.  UI : UI is pretty standard ; however translation and description of skills could be better. It is extremely confusing to know which skill scales with either attack or casting speed.  Combat : Fast and engaging , stylish and satisfying.  Character building and development :  There are no fixed classes so you can play a hybrid of pretty much anything ; This is detrimental to the long term success of the game BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS DEEP AS PATH OF EXILE. There is really no variety in class building / theorycrafting in this game. Veteran ARPG players likes to spend an hour or so to theory craft their builds but this is not possible. Also, if you intend on playing a summoner build , hold off for now because SUMMONS DO NOT SCALE WITH ANY IN-GAME PLAYER GEAR ; there is only 1 unique item which increases their damage and that's about it. The Gates of Fate ( Similar to Path of Exile's Skill Tree) is not expansive enough. Re-spec in this game is really , really cheap so I don't see a point in starting another character.  Storyline : It's the best in any ARPG and the cinematics are top-notch.  Itemization : Itemization is good but can be better, There are no set items in this game. It is pretty much a tried tested and proven Diablo 3 where you insert various gems in your weapon and armor slots. You can however re-roll the type of sockets and rolls on your items with certain end-game materials.  End-game : Copy and pasted from Diablo 3 rift dungeons. , At the end of the dungeon , you get loot and that's about it. Atleast in Diablo 3, you get to upgrade your gems but there isn't any legendary gem socketing in this game. You unlock the ""Champion of Stormfall mode"" , where you send out mercenaries to do missions and the only way to complete the timer is for you to do dungeon runs. So it becomes an insane , insane dungeon farming loop and it's similar to Diablo 3 , POE and Grim Dawn.   Bugs : I did ran into gamebreaking bugs that needed me to restart this game ; this is totally unacceptable as this game has been out for 6 months or so. Bugs included : Unable to move on to the next location and not able to teleport back to town. I experienced one game crash.   Final verdict : 5/10 , get it on sale or discount. This game will be at it's best in another year or so. There is a huge issue within the community regarding some of the features advertised during it's early access and was not implemented during release , and when you consider this game has been in early access for FIVE YEARS , they should have done better. It's a cash and grab in my honest opinion. Wolcen has a long , long way to go if they want to challenge Grim Dawn , POE , Diablo 3 , Torchlight 2 and even Last Epoch. You're better off spending money on Chronicon / Grim Dawn if you love ARPG's."
95337898,english,0,424370,"Imagine ordering a pizza from a new place. Some time later a  manager calls you and tells you, that a pizza will be delivered a bit later, as they are overworked.

101719096,english,1,424370,"I avoided this game up until a few weeks ago (when it went on one of its sales) because of the mixed reviews. I was craving an arpg, but felt like I played most of those that I wanted. I noticed the the reviews were still mixed but going up since the release and looked into it more as the devs seemed to be still active and trying to turn the game around. I decided to take the leap, and honestly, I'm glad I did. Although this is definitely not the best arpg I've played, I had a good time playing through the story and currently doing a little end game content. That being said there are definitely some criticisms, but it does appear that the devs are keen on fixing most of the issues I have in future patches. Even with only having a fun time going through the story, I played around 30-40 hours, which alone was good enough to justify the 20 something dollars I paid, although maybe not full price. Here are the list of positives and negatives for me:  Positives: -Best graphics in an arpg so far -Combat is satisfying and and fun -Story I thought was pretty good and kept me interested (people are mad about the ending, but I don't mind the cliff-hanger knowing they plan on adding it later especially when I got a lot out of what was already there) -I like the passive talent trees -I also like that you can customize each skill to fit different builds  Negative: -I wish there were more skills available. I was a little disappointed with the limited selection despite how customizable they are. A part of me was also disappointed that you can basically get all the active skills you will use for the rest of the game really early, as you can just buy them. -Uninteresting gear. I've had a few legendary and unique pieces of armor and weapons so far, but none of them were really that interesting, just better stats than the other gear, with sometimes a small twist on something with the unique armor. I would really like to see this area fleshed out more in future patches. -Although I'm enjoying the end game so far, I can definitely see it getting stale in the near future (particularly with no really interesting gear to ""switch things up"").  Neutral: -I know another gripe of people were glitches in the game. I know this will vary between systems, but I had only 3 glitches that I noticed, one of which was a crash. The other two were minor. It seems like they did a great job cleaning them up, at least from my experience. -Kind of mixed on having the skills completely determined by the weapon. I wanted to make a pally type character only to realize I couldn't use some of the skills I wanted to do (although I did google and find out there is one shield that allows spells with a shield, but it still kind of bugged me). I also had a rogue character that I feel would be perfect with 1 or 2 of the spells, but can't unless I don't duel wield daggers (have to do one dagger with a catalyst in the other hand), which makes it feel like it isn't the rogue anymore.  -No Act 4. Currently, the story leaves you on a cliff-hanger as I mentioned. I don't find it necessarily a bad thing as I it makes me want to stick around to see what happens. That being said I understand people's point that it is a full game and it should have already been in it.  Overall, it was definitely worth the price I paid ($24 I think) (on the fence at full price). It has its issues, but the devs seem active and I hope they truly make this into an even better game."
91562161,english,1,424370,"So, I managed to beat this thing.  I should probably note my perspective on this is perhaps a little unusual, because I NEVER knew of the kickstarter. All I knew going in was the game had a rough launch, but had been getting patches and updates, until I saw it on sale sometime after Bloodtrail came out and though ""Hey, why not?"" So a lot of the controversy around this game I was mostly unaware of.  So coming into this somewhat blind and well after the fact? What's here is not half bad. It's basically Path of Diablo 3, taking clear influences from both games. Like Diablo 3 you've got highly modifiable skills, but a giant passive skill tree like Path of Exile etc.  That said the game manages to put a few of it's own twists on things. The skill tree for example, can have parts of it rotated, Want to use nodes form opposite ends of the tree? No need to use a bunch of skill points to path across, just move the tree a bit so the parts you want are closer together. In fact I'd argue flexibility in character building is this game's greatest strength. most passive skills in this game cover broad categories, think ""any elemental damage"" or ""any physical damage"" rather than ""fireball"" or ""swords"" so for whatever build you've got going, there's probably a few different skills that will work with it, and since skills learn abilities that change their damage type, skills that generally wouldn't fit a build can be MADE to do so. Elemental affliction on a melee fighter? Sure, why not?  The biggest drawbacks I can think of, controversy aside, is the game is short. I beat it in about 15 hours, I was skipping most of the little side dungeons, but really there's not much in the way of side content here. There is an endgame called Champion of Stormfall which looks decently involved, though I haven't dabbled in it much as of this writing.  While the game has a reputation for bugs, I haven't really encountered many in my playthrough. mostly it was texture pop in and maybe some animation issues early on, odd, but nothing show-stopping. The devs HAVE been patching since launch, though people keep saying it's buggy, so I'm not sure if those reviews are simply outdated or if this is a ""it works on my PC""(tm) thing.  Finally i'll note for better or worse this game is VERY edgelord in presentation. It looks like the devs played some Warhammer, saw everyone's massive shoulders and said ""here, hold my beer."" whether that's annoying, awesome or both is up to individual preference.  So... yeah, overall, not bad! I maybe wouldn't say to rush and buy it now because this thing had a rough history and there's plenty of solid looter-rpgs out there without that hanging over its head. but if you don't care about that or are feeling curious? By all means give it a shot, you might be surprised."
131164238,english,0,424370,"Because of the new update I decided to give the game another chance. Turns out it remains incredibly frustrating and I really can't recommend the game to anyone.  First of all, the game lags throughout. Even with a very low ping this is very noticeable. It takes up to five seconds between clicking on the merchant and opening the menu. With a ping of 30.  The lag is also clearly noticeable in combat, especially when using a healing potion. In the HUD, you can clearly see how the empty life bar is filled, then falls back to its original state for a fraction of a second, only to be filled again. It's so much fun when a fatal hit kills you thanks to this lag.  Speaking of death, once you die, you have three respawns. Resurrecting is only allowed for a short period of time and the game always respawns you at your corpse. Once you revive, you are immediately vulnerable to damage again. This can (and will!) lead to you being revived in a poisonous cloud and dying again immediately.  The game has no animation cancelling. Short explanation what animation cancelling means: If you are in an animation (e.g. casting a spell), but then suddenly want to dodge an attack, the spell is canceled and the character dodges. This function does not exist in the game. Meaning  that every animation, no matter how small and unimportant, is played to the end before a new input by the player is accepted. There are constantly situations in battles where the game tells you that you should dodge an attack, but you can't because you're already casting a spell or your character has to finish his walking animation first.  In the end, the game feels extremely laggy and unresponsive.  After almost three years we finally have the last chapter of the story (lol). Of course, at this point I have no idea what it was about and just skipped through the dialogs. I just dont care anymore. So i cant review the story But looks visually nice, like the rest of the game.  The gameplay of the last chapter, however, I can review. And it is a disaster. There is hardly any pure story gameplay compared to the other chapters. Instead, the mechanics of the previous endgame have been reworked to stretch out the gameplay of the last chapter as long as possible. Instead of going from area to area like in the previous chapters (and all other diablo likes games). You now have to research the next story mission on a map. To advance this research you now have to empty random dungeons. Basically the research of new Missions take for example 3  turns, and one dungeons is a turn.  You can accelerate the research and unlock other buffs by other researches, but these also take turns. This was the old endgame and it is obvious this was reworked to rush out the story chapter. If you have finally researched the final boss, you can now research debuffs for the boss. These are enormously expensive (gold and other resources) and are done by the same research mechanic. So you invest a lot of gold and time to weaken the boss, run dungeons, get better gear and try to enjoy the gameplay. But there are two huge problems:  1) At some point, the game forces you to start the fight. You have no other choice. Several battles with different tasks follow. And hopefully you knew exactly which debuffs you were researching. Because: 2) If you die in this battle (because you weakened the wrong attack or a buggy mechanic killed you), all your progress is gone. All buffs and debuffs are deactivated, your gold is gone of course and you are back to square one. Now you have to waste a ton of time again, have to spend hundredthousands of gold again and hope you get him the next time.  Yeah it could be cool rogue lite feature, if the gameplay would be fun. But sadly it isnt. Its frustrating. I gave this game many chances. But the gameplay issues since day one, the chapter 4 mechanic that just an insult and Diablo IV and Path of Exile on the horizon i dont think i will every enjoy this game.  And i didnt even mention the bugs (and there are so many!), the boring gear system, the uninspred skills and the pseudo deep character progression."
60421532,english,1,424370,"Played for more than 12 hours, unlike some others. I have only purchased the game in the last 3 days so I haven't gone through the massive wait also like some others who would be salty about that now. Just like Diablo there is a very toxic community who seem to 'dog' the game and spoil things for others. Maybe that's just the hack n slash community.  Whats awesome, ie what I wish other games had including Diablo that I spent 1000's of hours playing: -Hypnotic wheat animation, I've already spent moments running around in it just for relaxation purposes. -Music that reminds me of Baulders Gate, that I also spent 1000's of hours playing -Leveling like I've never seen before. Some aspects are familiar but then something different. -Skills are just found and can be learnt by any class. -Tumble for everyone. -Voice for all. No more reading. AND did I hear Minsc (Jim Cummings)? I hope I did. -Random Treasure chest spawn locations. Can;t guess where they will be at the moment. So gotta look around. -No limitation on who can wear the armour you find. -STEAM PUNK theme. Love that, time to move forward in time. Why don't sequels do that? start why back when and move forward after a few releases. -Some old familiar mechanics but also some new. about 50/50. Now I am interested but not completely lost. -Loving the varied weapon sound effects. I can it the same thing a few times and get different sounds from my sword.  Now those complaining about the time for release. Kinda reminds me of waiting for Diablo 4 or Linage. This team is a lot smaller. Remember when Diablo 3 came out. People said it was coonie/goonar rubbish but it got patched and patched and worked on. Just like assetto corsa when it came out as well. Patience is key these days. No games come out like Baulders Gate these days that are awesome on release. Makes me thing that waiting 2 years after the release is better when I think about it. Release is more like early access these days.  I hope this review is ok with mentions of other games."
39909780,english,0,424370,"* A year later.... + some, They finally shiped a update ""the new junk"". Gave it 1hr and will unfollow this crap.   ___________________________________________________________ I love the genre and see tons of potential in this, but for now there is way too little content to recommend it.  I know its alpha but almost two years in early access you should be able to show a bit more content. 20hrs in I got 3 level 20 chars with good gear and basically just farm for nothing.  My concern is that it been in alpha since 2015 and first ETA said it would go beta in 2016 (from Kickstarter). Even then they stated four years of preperation and all the storyline etc was done.  Open to change the review once I feel that I can recommend the game to others but for now just add it on your follow list."
105779535,english,1,424370,"cool game. visually amazing, worth it if you like games like diablo or path of exile.  Just beware that you have to play this game in offline mode otherwise its pretty much unplayable due to only 25% of your attacks actually hitting and lag walking all over the place, this will probably never be fixed either.  Your progress is also wiped when you switch to offline mode.  So if your reading this it might be best to put it in offline mode right away when you start."
71380132,english,1,424370,"I am torn with rating this game. Its has huge potential but also some severe problems.  Pros: - huge skill tree (you can develop your character just any way you feel like) - Interesting feature to build up your ""city"" to support and aid your hero - awesome graphics (including battle animations)  Cons: - laking endgame content (especially loot: no sets and highest tier items are the worst in game) - not very engaging team of developers (they like to nerf skills and create the most useless unique items possible showing that they dont understand their own game in that respect) - due to the afore-mentioned there is a severe limit on character development possibilities (yes you can chose any skills you like but in actual fact only very few builds really work well)  I will give this a thumb up simply because I hope that the developers will eventually create meaningful set items and fix many of the useless skills.  Dont buy this game yet. Put it on your wishlist and wait for the problems to be solved (and a sale) !"
63860641,english,0,424370,"After playing Wolcen for nearly 50 hours, reaching level 70 and Expedition level 103, I feel that I can finally share my opinion on this game with others.  Wolcen is a beautiful game full of potential, but ultimately unpolished in it's gameplay elements with very little to no originality. it isn't to say no effort was put in this game, but these efforts weren't put where it mattered the most.  Let's begin with the good stuff:  Visuals:  The graphics and environnements are gorgeous. The ship graveyard in the intro is simply amazing. The Spells and Skill visual effects are also very good. The character model are quite decent and the transmog (fashion) system is quite simply what games these days treat as standard. Finally, the enemy models are clear and a quick glance will let you know what you are up against. Zones are also distinct from one another.  Audio:  The audio is good. The music is good while it isn't memorable. The voice acting is solid for the most part. Finally, the sound effects of weapons/skills/spells sound impactful. The gear drop as various cue for different rarity and items type and it is quite clear what drops on the ground based on sound only.   Boss Fight (during the story) :  While heavily inspired by Diablo 3 upon release, the boss fight are multi phased encounters with various mechanics, patterns and overlaps to master. You will most likely die and struggle at some point or another on your first run through each of them. Ressource management is key and mechanic anticipation essential. I had a good vibe of the Inferno d3 level of difficulty (minus the enrage mechanics on all boss) and that was perhaps the best thing d3 did on release.  and now, for the not so good:  Gameplay:  While the gameplay in a Arpg isn't necessarely very deep, in Wolcen it is straight up braindead (outside the boss fight which represent 1% of the game). You spam a main skill and plow through mass of enemies without a second thought. you dodge from time to time and that's about it. Base skill cast speed is ludicrously slow and it is painful to cast a buff that last 5 second and look at a 2 second animation that stop your movement dead in it's track.  While skills are visually nice, very few ends up being fun to use along side one another. you to use 1 of 3 types of skills. A range weapon/dagger allow for rogue skills, a melee weapon allow for melee skills and a staff/catalyst for spells. No real class, no real skill mixing, that's pretty much it. You play what your weapon gives you. Enemies don't get smarter and are basically scaling hp/dmg sponges.  ARPG Grind Loop:  This one is perhaps my biggest dissapointement with this game. There are no meaningful, build defining items in this game. Quite simply all items do, is buff certain stats. The end. You would think unique items (which seemed very interesting at first) would have an impact on build, since they allow sometime the use of other class skills, but no. They don't scale past level 40 (campaign ends at level 40 ish). They are so rare while leveling that you will never use them. you use rare items and the ''legendary'' (rare with 1 or 2 extra stat buff). Max level requirement tops at 60 and the items get stronger (a few extra numbers). They had some good ideas with the end game unlocks, where you unlock feature by starting projects and completing them by playing. Sadly, it doesn't equate to much more than a few features unlocked which barely improve a meaningless, shallow grind, just a tad better.  Identity:  Now this one is sad. This game, while definitely full of passion, doesn't have a strong identity. It's Diablo 3 mixed with Path of Exile. You get a few good bit of both game, without ever getting very deep in what made those other 2 unique. The gear design is very diablo 3-esque (which is just stupid considering how much better d1 and d2 design is), the skill tree is a less developped PoE version, mainly providing number change rather than gameplay change. There is a ascended form (big immortal high cd low duration form) but it's actually useless and clunky about 99% of the game. it feels like a concept that got abandonned near the end of developpement but left in the game because there was so much time investement in the visual design of the system. Ultimately, Wolcen fails to bring any form of authenticity to the ARPG table, which is severly lacking in my opinion.    I will skip over the many gamebreaking bugs of the few days as I think the dev did a decent job at fixing them while probably being under pressure to meet a deadline release date imposed on them by the publisher. Wolcen was a fun experience for a few hours, but I cannot see myself come back to it any time soon. Unfortunate for a game that was 4 years + in production."
71195108,english,0,424370,"Like everyone's saying, this game's just... meh.  It's not special, it's not interesting, and while it's pretty, it's also buggy as heck.  The game truly lost out on what made it so unique during development too, gradually becoming more and more generic and soulless.  This isn't just seeing the past with rose tinted glasses, as it had problems at every stage of development, but back when I bought this game it really did have an innovative skill system where you could do literally anything you wanted to with mixing and matching your abilities.  Now it just has a few distinct weapon classes that determine what skills you can use and the only way to go out of them is to change your weapon or to be lucky enough to get gear that lets you cast something else, because your skills sure won't let you by default.  More importantly, it's just horrendously balanced, with several skills being pointless, and the story really is just... so default and boring that it's painful.  I know ARPGs don't tend to have the best stories in general, but they could have at least tried to keep some of their initial story's concepts.  I'd avoid it for now, honestly.  The first hours seem to suck in new players, but a lot of people end up feeling a hollow experience in the end."
95060401,english,0,424370,"I've read numerous reviews and some of the more recent reviews stated that a lot of bugs had been fixed. I trusted those reviews and honestly have to say that I am very disappointed in this game.  The Pros:  As I first started playing I was liking Wolcen. The graphics are astounding.  The storyline is engaging and drew me in even further. The implementation of skills are unique and don't lock your character into a single playstyle. The soundtrack is nice and the voice acting is superb.  I thought that since the main aspects of this game were well implemented that this had to be good news and that the developers must have learned from their mistakes and finally fixed their broken game.  The Cons:  Offline characters are separate from online characters. You cannot cross over from offline to online or vice versa. Offline is the only true way to play single player.  If you want to play single player while using an online character then you are forced to flag your game as private.  But nobody plays multiplayer in the first because it is a shit fest of lag and skills not doing damage to NPC's.  There are no side quests. You must follow the storyline. The only semblance of side quests are when you enter a sub-area of the static questline and every time the only goal is to kill all the npc's. These 'side quests' are identical in every zone. Every. Single. Time.  The gold collecting pet gets lost and stuck. Several times I had to backtrack to attempt to get it unstuck. If it did not work than I had to restart the game and I ended up losing all progression through that part of the map and was forced to restart from the previous Town Portal/Waypoint.  The monsters and bosses are mindbogglingly simple. There is no threat of dying and if even you were to come close then you just use a health potion and your life meter is instantaneously refilled. Then the health potions are easily refilled as you kill more NPC's. It's really easy to NOT perish.  As a Summoner my army would sometimes just simply stop attacking NPC's. Fortunately/Unfortunately the game is so embarrassingly simple that I was able to solo each encounter and afterwards my army would return to attacking NPC's again. This bug could prove to be fatal if they game had any semblance of difficulty because there are achievements that you can attain for not dying.  When looking at items in your inventory you hover your mouse over them to see the stats, as is with most every ARPG. Yet more than half time when I would open my inventory hovering over items would do nothing and closing and reopening did not fix the issue. I mean all it ended up taking to fix this issue was  to simply click inside the inventory and the hover function would return to normal. Not game-breaking but still very annoying.  There are invisible walls that blocked my path even though the map showed that these areas should be easily navigated.  I can't imagine how many more bugs I would have encountered If I had decided to continue playing. Each of the bugs on their own merit are not game breaking (except for the Summoners army bugging out) but it is the sheer numbers and frequency of recurrence that killed all mediocre enjoyment I had.  edit: Corrected several spelling mistakes. Game is still garbage."
63474438,english,0,424370,"Don't buy the game yet, way too many bugs as it is. I made it all the way until act 3 before the game decided to reset my character's story progress from the beginning. Kept all the gear/levels, but now I have to grind through the story once again.... Feels bad man, especially since the later areas are super repetitive."
68533935,english,1,424370,"This is one of the harder reviews I have ever had to do. Wolcen is a complete mixed bag of emotions, fun gameplay, lack of polish, and frustrating bugs. It's an ARPG, which means at it's very core, I am probably going to like it.  I'm a well traveled dungeon crawler as my first game was Champions of Norrath on PS2. Sacrilege to those that started with the Diablo series, but I simply missed D2 in it's heyday. My favorite ARPG of all time is Diablo 3 with Path of Exile following closely behind. I have well over 700 hours into Diablo 3 with over 300 hours into Path of Exile (my most played Steam game).  I value exciting, visceral combat above all else. The game being nice to look at doesn't hurt either.  This is why I find myself recommending a game that is honestly, a bit of a mess. Wolcen launched with a shit storm similar to Diablo 3's launch. Nobody could log in and bugs went wild. Full disclosure, I had the game on launch and elected to play offline. At the time of this review I am sitting at 35 or so hours of gameplay. ALL of those hours were offline which saved me a ton of headaches.  Wolcen does a lot of things really well. The game is just flat out gorgeous. I have spent a lot of time in the transmog screen perfecting the look of my character. My character in Wolcen looks 10x better than any character I have ever made. In any game. Particle effects are gorgeous. The environments are destructive and look great. This is the pinnacle of graphics in an ARPG.   The combat is really, really good in Wolcen as well. The game manages to have the weight and fluidity of Diablo 3 without being a complete rip off. Diablo 3 combat is structured around using resource gaining abilities to then use resource spending abilities. Wolcen instead goes for a tug of war resource system where you use willpower abilities to transfer into rage abilities and vice versa. It's fun to play with especially when you start getting gear and passive nodes that speed up those transfer times.  Gear in Wolcen is middle of the pack. It's not the stupidly simply itemization of Diablo 3 where you simply look for green arrows and it isn't the extreme complexity of Path of Exile. I feel like Wolcen strikes a solid balance in the middle ground in itemization...which the game tends to do in general.   Nobody plays an ARPG for it's campaign, but I'm happy to report that Wolcen probably has the best campaign out of modern ARPG offerings. It's fairly well written and the voice acting isn't bad either. It's quick and once it's over, you don't have to deal with it again. You stay in endgame mode much like Diablo 3's ""adventure mode."" Perfect.  So that's all the good. What's the bad?   The endgame is lacking right now. It exists, but it's incredibly repetitive. You blast through what are essentially nephalem rifts from Diablo 3 and build upgrades for the main city which gives you certain bonuses like an extra skill slot or higher magic find stats. That's about it. The maps get boring fairly fast and the developers made the poor decision of having the end of the run boss spawn in a static location. When you fill up the kill meter the boss should spawn on top of you like it does in D3. Instead you have to back tread in the instance that you already passed the boss area or fight through meaningless hordes to get to the boss area. It's sloppily done.  The game is a fairly buggy mess as well. As I already mentioned, I played exclusively offline. Which means I avoided probably 90% of the problems. Players that played online reported stash wipes and even entire characters vanishing. These are the kinds of bugs that would cause me to uninstall the game immediately. Thankfully, they never happened to me. Instead I came across crashes, graphical glitching, campaign missions not properly triggering cut scenes, passive nodes that either do not work as intended...or just don't work at all, and chests in impossible to reach locations.  The game just doesn't feel like it is a complete game. Everything just kind of feels half baked. In the end, you have to ask yourself what you are looking for in an ARPG. If you want a game with hundreds and hundreds of hours...this likely isn't it. After 30 plus hours I just didn't have the drive anymore to do another three expeditions. I ultimately went back to Path of Exile. This seems like a non recommendation, but it isn't. I thoroughly enjoyed my 35 hours in a $35 game (I bought it when it was on early access). It's a game with a pretty solid foundation that needs a lot of repair work and added content. Hopefully the devs don't give up on this game because I think this game could be something special this time next year."
83081451,english,0,424370,"Singleplayer experience first playthrough at launch was ok, and quite fun. Even though many talents were not working and a lack of viable builds. End game was boring. Dropped the game.  Online was riddled with bugs I heard, and the fact that 100,000 plus players dropped the game within weeks says it all.  Came back after Blood Trail. Played an online character, bugged campaign within 30-40 mins, could not progress. How the developer still release broken/buggy content is beyond me. Dropped again.  STILL NOT RECOMMENDED."
129787478,english,1,424370,"I completely gave up on this game back when it released in 2020. It has come a long way and game play is much better and frankly, fun. Give it a second look. There is a lot of fun to be had here,"
65699557,english,0,424370,"ARPG, mix of diablo and Path of Exile I would not recommend this game for 2 reasons: 1) Too many critical bugs 2) It's just a simpler version of PoE If you read this in 1+ years and think they PoE is too complex for you, it might be worth trying Wolcen, but look at the patch notes and be sure they have fixed all the crashing bugs before you buy!  The passive skill tree in Wolcen is a simpler version of PoEs but it is too simple. After figuring it out, there is really only a few choises to make, and the rest is given. The active skills work in a similar was too D3s skill runes system, and (opposite of the passives) this works better than D3! The story is nothing spectacular, but it's not bad ether. Good enough for an ARPG.  It feels like a mix of diablo and path of exile, where diablo have the AAA UI and story, and PoE have the gameplay,  Wolcen have more AAA feel than PoE and more gameplay than diablo (or rather, i expect it will have after a few updates)  Bugs bugs and more bugs: It's another title that looks good on paper, but is about 1 year too early for release. The bugs are many, but the game killer bug is that when you play the endgame content, you have to play 3 dungeon levels in a row, but if the game crashes no progress is saved. This means you can play for 1-2 hours and then the game crashes as you turn in for reward and you have wasted 1-2 hours for nothing. If it wasn't for the gamebreaking bugs, i wouls have recommended this game for all players that like ARPG and thing PoE is too complex.  A good first try, but not good enough :)"
50772177,english,0,424370,"The devs seems to still struggle in figuring what they want to do with their game and also can't seem to focus on one thing at time, which has lead to countless delays and the game being redone from scratch twice since the early access started 3 years ago.  It feels like they don't really know what they're doing at all... instead of focusing in completing the core features of the game, like adding new acts and skills, they go around adding random stuff that is totally pointless to bring at the current state of the game... Who the hell cares for a Housing system or an Arena, when the game is STILL under development, our characters don't even have access to the complete passive skill tree, and our characters will get wiped every now and them??? It's like they can't really decide what they want to do with Wolcen at this point, and I wouldn't be surprised if they simply gave up on this game.  If you're looking for a cool ARPG, then I recommend you to look elsewhere, because this game will take forever to be finished at this pace... if it ever gets finished.  Wolcen: Lords of Delay is a more fitting name for your game.  Update:  I just received a warning from one of the developers saying I was being ""disrespectful"" on a forum post where I shared my feedback and disagreement on preventing you to use spells without equipping spell catalists on your character... I heard people getting their feedback posts getting ""shot down"" by developers, but I thought they were being dramatic or even trolling to piss the devs off... that was until it actually happened to me and I got this warning message saying I was being disrespectful in my post.  I advise anyone that is reading this game to stay the hell away from this game, because the devs are either insane, or just don't care for honest feedback from people wanting to help them to make a better game and just wants to be praised for whatever crap they do to their game.  I'm officially done with this game, and I advise people to stay away from it, to avoid stressing yourselves up."
69958089,english,0,424370,"Despite the fact that the game underwent ALOT of reiterations, the final product unfortunatly is no longer what made the game unique in the first place on top of being a technical disaster in many ways.  Wolcen, formerly Umbra initially managed to get quite some attention with a broad skill system on top of the still existing talent wheel system. Though the wheel system in its core concept is still present, most nodes mostly just consist of simple stat bonuses that offer no noticeable benefit. There are a few nodes that actually do something to enhance your playstyle but these are quite rare and should have been added in a big quantity instead.  The ability perk system was another system that used to alter spells to a point where they totally escalate like launching 8 fireballs in a cone instead of now just having a slow missile that's not even great. The game should have embraced that level of craziness instead of being the sterile game that it is now.  Another major OOF is the removal of the open world. Umbra used to be open world so you could travel through the world with few up to no loading screens at all. That is completely gone. It's now a typical isolated area style of game where zones are being split by portal like doors and passages. A shame.  The story is okay'ish. It's not really special as it's basically: bad god wanna invade the world and control everything and (of course) you are the guy who will prevent that. However, also here is a big OOF: the story is not complete. There is a big chunk of content cut from the final part of the game as you can see that Stormfall changes during the final act while it has no context at all and we don't even get to fight the true bad guy of the story. Based on what is left of it inside the game, the best part of it was yet suposed to come but apparently they went out of time and hat to make a choice.  Artwise the game is gorgeous. The environments are beautiful and the music is pretty epic. Nothing to complain about here.  Now to the ugly part - the bugs. The game launched in a partially unplayable state. The multiplayer completely died for days and the singleplayer mode was riddled with bugs in all possible ways. From duplication exploits, over non-functional passives and skills up to losing all story progress for no reason. This went on for days and even today the game still has alot of things to flesh out.  But the true reason why they get my thumbs down... the only true reason: where the heck is the Driller?! (that's a joke btw)"
109249112,english,1,424370,"At launch, this game was not so great -- bugs, server issues, poor balancing, and ultimately an unsatisfying end game progression. But by now (early 2022), the game is everything I want out of an ARPG -- polished, wide variety of interesting skills, intricate yet not PoE-level-complex passive skill tree, fluid and challenging combat, and L O O T. Lewd loot to ogle at. It's almost silly how much time you spend picking up loot and examining it to see if you got something good, and almost every run you do get something that's at least worth chucking in to the crafting system.  There is a lot to do here yet, and I could see myself sinking a few hundred hours in to this yet.  Compared to other ARPGs: -Grim Dawn with expansions has a ton more content. Progression is slower, compared to the almost frenzied pace of finding upgrades in Wolcen. I like the combat and skill systems about equally. -Last Epoch is a long way from done, but shows a lot of promise and could be as good -Diablo 3 set a nicer standard for fluid combat with MMO elements like CC and party buffs and defensive skills becoming important. But the loot system in that game is F tier; this game is leaps and bounds better. -D2R is very grindy and there's no crafting and a very simple skill system. The appeal is mostly in the trade economy and the large player base. -Path of Exile is absurdly grindy. I love the skill system and variety of scenery and content in the endgame, but the pacing of finding gear upgrades gets slow and I lose interest.  If you like ARPG games, I think this is one of the best ones out there right now."
23826474,english,1,424370,"This game looks extremely promising. For an alpha its pretty stable and has actually a lot of content to offer. I really like, that I may explore the world while there are actually no quests to do (the available quest line will take you 1-1,5 hours to complete). There is a quite a lot of different loot to be found, so are skills. You will definitely get a few hours off the alpha at the current state.  So lets take a look at the game. I will concentrate more on the good things because its still an alpha. The first thing you will notice after starting the game is the quality of the graphics. Powered by the cry engine, the game creates really nice environments. The day-night cycle adds a lot of atmosphere. Running around in a pitch black dark forest is quite nasty. The lighting effects are really nice and add a lot of quality, especially to the magic effects.  Looking at the combat mechanics, this game has a nice system with two differents ressources. One of them is umbra and is more the ressource used by spells. The other one being rage which is filled by using certain spells or just by attacking. Both ressource balance each other out, if you use your umbra your rage increases and vice versa. This way you always have the possibility to use skills which is really nice. It also requires you to keep track on your ressources so you know which skills you may use at a certain time. Skills level up when used and may either be upgraded by increasing their power or optimising their cooldown / ressource cost. The character levels up by experience, you get attribute points and passive points when reaching the next level. The passive points allow you to strengthen your character in diffent ways (like your magic or offensive capabilities). The passive system is just your basic +% or +X to crit/something system. It would by more interesting if there would be synergies between the different trees or anything else which expands the system a bit.  I will update my review from time to time to reflect the changes the dev implements. So far the devs put out improvements on a regular basis and at a quite impressive pace. At this moment i can absolutely recommend this game!"
95332098,english,1,424370,"Wolcen is a solid and mostly conventional ARPG, but with some quirks that make it stand by itself. The interesting gameplay angle for me is how skill use is handled. Instead of using a singular resource like Mana to cast skills or spells, as is common in ARPGs since Diablo, there are two connected resources: Willpower and Rage. Using one builds the other. So, depending on the selection of weapons and skills/spells you're using, it's possible to use skills indefinitely (albeit potentially limited by cooldowns).   You won't be popping magic potions to enable you to use skills - rather, you will use one type of attack or skill which drains Willpower to deal damage while building up Rage, and then use another type of attack or skill to discharge that Rage, which frees up Willpower again. This means that you're actively being incentivized by the design of the game to use a good variety of skills and even to cross-class, rather than being rewarded for sticking to one skill tree, focusing only on one or two active skills, and sinking the rest of your points into passives (as some other ARPGs unfortunately fall into). This keeps your skill use varied and keeps combat engaging, by preventing you from falling into the trap of building a ""boring but effective"" character.  Graphically and in terms of audio design the game is great as well, and there's some stand-out voice acting from some of the major characters in the story. The story is suitably epic to keep you engaged in it for at least the first playthrough. Besides the story, if you like your build a lot and want to keep playing it after the story ends, there's a post-story mode which allows you to generate infinite random missions while using the resources you gain from this to build up a base, which in turn improves your ability to generate more interesting missions, find or craft better gear, etc. Personally I prefer to replay the story with a different build entirely than to grind away at the same character endlessly, but the option exists if you want it, which is great.  EDIT: Actually never mind, endgame is pretty fun with my current build, so I'm doing that too.  (Minor aside: most of the higher-tier pauldron designs are completely ridiculous, but you can put glamors on your armor pieces for free, so it's not a major problem.)  A lot of the negative reviews you'll see are about bugs which have been mostly addressed, or disappointment at the way that the development has been handled. Legitimate issues for sure, especially for those who have been following the game since its early development; apparently it was supposed to be an open-world game and became a more conventional Diablo-like as time went on. But I wasn't following the development and most bugs seem to have been addressed by now. If like me you're coming in fresh and don't have specific expectations on how the game should be, but just want a familiar Diablo- or Torchlight- or PoE-like single-player ARPG with a few unique gameplay twists in a fresh setting, Wolcen is a great pick."
61709639,english,1,424370,"Updated for release: Despite some initial (now seemingly resolved) issues with server uptime, stash disappearances, and player progression rollbacks, Wolcen is still an amazingly fun ARPG.  There is still some work that needs to be done to bolster the multiplayer aspects and perhaps polish up the character trees a bit, but overall the foundation they are building upon is rock solid.  Character customization is rare in ARPGs so I welcome it, I love the ability to mix abilities and playstyles, and I even enjoy the story so far which is rare in games of this ilk.    Some players are upset with the challenges the game and team has faced and while their frustration is understandable and I too have been disappointed at times, we have to remember that this is not an enormous team and that it is no small thing to build a game of this quality and studio around it; things will take time.  That's my opinion anyway.    I discovered Wolcen originally in 2018 and loved the concept of it, but unfortunately soon after my initial introduction to the game the team scrapped the build and rebuilt the entire game from the ground up.  There was a significant delay of about a year as the game was developed, which precipitated much of the vitriol you see in some reviews from the community.  Some players felt they were short changed on the original concept of the game, which I can understand, but I personally was willing to give them a second chance.  I'm glad I did.  The game has truly be entirely re-designed and conceptually reworked; it now boasts a steampunk aesthetic, cutscenes, and a more coherent story than before.  Thus far, I've been having an utter blast and praise the developers for taking such a big chance and sticking to their vision even with all the pushback from the community.  Well done; going to play this one extensively!"
60663993,english,1,424370,"Currently at the time of writing, this game is in beta, and it is feeling quite good. Pretty smooth playing and the controls feel good. I've had a few hiccups and bugs, but this is expected and therefore I'm not concerned with it as I can simply just go and post on the Wolcen forums.  I do not know the history of the game or what was sold to people, but as an ARPG, I'm happy.  It is less complex than PoE, and more complex than Diablo 3, which for me is perfect as I cannot deal with the sheer complexity of PoE builds at this time in my life, but wanted something a little bit more than Diablo 3 in terms of build variety.  tldr: the game looks good, it feels good, it has bugs, the devs are working on it, it is overall enjoyable and pretty affordable."
135010202,english,0,424370,"Other reviews have (rightfully) discussed all the bugs, so instead I want to cover the absolute mess that is the over all game design up to and including Act 4.  The marketing tells you skills can be customized with 16 different modifiers each, however almost all of them consist of ""deal 15% more damage"". Most skills don't have any meaningful choices beyond ""Summon one less minion but more damage.""  For a classless game, you're still restricted on what skills you can use by your weapons. Unfortunately there's no main-hand spell weapon, so it's impossible to cast spells with a shield. The weapon restriction is a bigger issue than it might seem since it highlights how few skills there actually are in the game. There are 12 Warrior skills, 13 Rogue skills (Daggers get to use Warrior and some Rogue skills, so they are an exception) and 18 Mage skills, of which 4 are summon-related. Since you can slot 6 skills at a time, there's not much real choice unless you go for a hybrid build.  The rotating passive wheel is a much better idea in practice. It actually heavily restricts freedom since you are still bound by what sections are adjacent and the devs decided that different sections (Warrior, Mage, and Rogue) should never be next to their related sections, so you have to path all over the place just to make a simple Two-Hander build, for instance. And there are so few sections in total that if you want to be a Warrior character and survive early you better build around Block since that's your only option in the second ring. Thankfully pathing is not expensive, but that leads to another problem where you end up with so many passive points that there are no real choices to make in your build, though I guess that's fine because most passive nodes are pretty boring anyways, including the big notable ones.  Speaking of being better in practice, it's amazing the ""Resource Opposition System"" survived Alpha, much less a single proof of concept. Playing a melee character and want to use your sweet shield charge ability to engage enemies? Better hope there's crates nearby to generate Rage, because by default you lose ALL of your Attack resource after combat. The only way around this is to build your passive tree around rushing to a specific 3rd tier node that causes your Rage to regenerate instead of your Willpower. I don't know if I can think of a worse way to handle this, to be honest. If skills are going to be locked behind your weapons, have your weapons decide your ""equilibrium point"". All melee? Rage regenerates and Willpower fades away. Half and half? Have them balance out to 50/50. Even hybrid builds are made super clunky by this since if you don't have the necessary resource and you try to use a skill, your character does nothing. Why don't you auto-attack when out of resources since that generates? Instead, when you need to be teleporting away from danger, you're just standing in middle of it.  Entering Act 4 as someone who never played Wolcen before now is super confusing. The story goes from climax to immediate cliffhanger to your character suddenly showing up at the city from Act I and being VERY concerned about an NPC you met once at the beginning of the game. No explanation for the time gap or even what happened, and apparently no other characters are even worried about whether or not the Big Bad is still roaming around? I get that part of the point of the story is that you are supposed to figure out as a player what happened to your character, but last time you were in the (single) main city, the entire thing was falling apart and it was filled with refugees. Then you get to Act 4 and everything is fine  all of a sudden and no one even mentions what happened to make things better.   Also, the (Act 4) voiced dialogue constantly differs from the on-screen text dialogue, and in three back-to-back conversations seconds apart, a captured enemy was immune to pain so you had to send for a specialist alchemist to get a truth serum, then when you go to send for the guy, instead your only option is for your court alchemists to work on a solution for the spell that is keeping him immune to pain, then after clicking the button to do so, you are told that the alchemists successfully cleared the no-pain-drugs from his system. Which is it? Spell or drugs? In addition, the tutorials for the endgame systems that are introduced in Act 4 clearly haven't been updated since its release, since they tell you to start Infrastructure projects that don't exist and congratulate you on successfully completing a project that wasn't even an option, much less one you did.  While some of the issues are baked into the DNA of the game, many others are either bugs that have existed since launch 3 years ago or design issues that they could solve in a single patch or even caught by a single QA person playing the opening of the brand new act with the sound on and also reading the text.  Ultimately it's clear that the Wolcen devs don't care in the least about their own game, so why should we?  If you're desperate for a new ARPG, it's fine at $10 USD but I wouldn't pay a cent more."
121294575,english,0,424370,"I played it a lot when it first came out. It was a mess then, without a doubt. I came back when they did the Wyvern or Dragon update and it was still a buggy mess.

Uninstall it again. Losing all those items was the last straw of constant bugs and annoyances.  Honestly, I tried. I want to like the game. I really enjoyed the story and the voice acting in many parts of this. The world building was pretty cool and some of the environmental design. However, the game is just always in an unacceptable state and it manages to kill any excitement I have. I was really wanting it to work, but it always feels like it shouldn't have ever left beta. I think there would be less flak for that decision. Devs, I'm sorry. I don't want to be rude or mean, but there's always so much nonsense to deal with each time. I hope things can get sorted out for you lot. I really do.  This was all documented in a private, online game"
137534697,english,1,424370,"7/10 Decent game with very high potential but the team of developers are either not many enough to go up the ladder or they don't care about it anymore.  Pos: * Good RPG elements for a Hack&Slash game with one of the most intriguing and complex skill build i have ever seen in long time  * Weapons and armour easy to combo with preferred skill combination * Good graphics & skills animation * Similarities to Diablo games but not as evolved and tested as Blizzard's. * Keeps you in front of PC. Cons: * Poor storyline * Mediocre voice acting * The game itself seems to be unfinished, unpolished and sometimes unplayable because of the servers/region * Because i couldn't find a way for transmuting gems or combine it, i realised how useless is to keep it in the stash and how a waste of time was arranging it in the hope later i will have the option to make it stronger ones (if i haven't discovered the way to do that but there is an option, then my apologies...) * Very buggy for a game released 2-3 years ago. That was something totally unexpected and unpleasantly surprised * The Multiplayer option is DEAD! Either very long times to connect with someone or not working at all in specific regions. * The loophole involving rising in level for no reason and doing the same thing over and over again, just to get stronger and bigger is so cheeky and ... disgraceful. Probably developers were having a meeting regarding new content release or DLC's and decided to just give as a way to continuing playing the game but without NEW chapters, maps, stories, viable MULTIPLAYER option or something much more exciting. BREADCRUMBS.  Anyway! I believe it's first time in my life when i give a thumbs up or good review to a game which has more cons than pos's and the reason why is simple. I enjoyed playing it for those few 65h aprox and i still reckon it has a lot of potential with a proper team and funding behind.  I'm not a professional gamer or critic, just writing my opinion in a personal way, describing with my own words the experience i had, not trying to be to fuzzy about specific content. Before buying something i read most of the times reviews by amateurs like me as i do not trust nowadays the professional youtuber's or gaming websites for simple reason that they get payed sometimes for those reviews and this have a tendency to influence the decision about rating the game itself. Always trust the ""little people"" as they will have no hidden interest behind their decisions of rating a game in a good or bad way, at least most of them/us.   PS: Thank you for dedicating some of your time reading all this. Hf gl."
45623922,english,1,424370,I just have one thing to say. I've backed this game for a long time and you all have the oppritunity to replace Diablo in the spotlight while they grab for cash.  Do not fck this up. Think about the game from the players POV and it will be gold.
111259378,english,0,424370,"[b]Do not buy, this game is unfinished.[/b]   Chapter 3 of the game ends with a ""To be continued"" and it hasn't been continued yet. Apparently it was released unfinished 2 years ago, with chapters 4 and 5 ""to come"". So far the developer seems to be only adding ""endgame content"" (killing the same monsters on the same maps over and over again without any reason or purpose) to a game that doesn't have an ending. Safe to assume it will stay unfinished. Very sad, since what exists of the story is fun&engaging and the world is cool."
93931359,english,0,424370,"I had high hopes for this game but the game has been ""out"" for over a year and they still haven't fixed obvious bugs like having to click into the right window for the tool tips to display.

50075926,english,0,424370,"UPDATE 14/2/2020:  So where to begin, I've left the old review up as I believe its important to see the behaviour of the developers and mods, and also the treatment of people who backed and funded their game. But here we are and it has actually released... sort of  So as expected its now just 3 acts (not the original promised 5) and the game is much much smaller in scope, no overworld areas at all, not even anything as open as D3 has. Now this in of itself is not a huge deal, I enjoyed aspects of D3 (post ROS) maps don't need to be big seemless affairs like say Grim Dawns, but it is a loss to the original vision of the game (imo)   The builds feel more limited and generic, there are signs everywhere of where they have wholesale stolen ideas (even visuals) from other games and titles, now generally they are done pretty well but it has like zero originality. The visuals feel like Warhammer/40k rip offs mixed elements of Tyranny. The skills and skill system feel like Lost Ark and D3 had a baby (but not as good as either yet)   The targetting is still wonky even after all these years (was an issue in original alpha I presume its related to cryengine not liking isometric games) the jolts in quality can be seen all over the place in terms of a rushed release. Sometimes you'll be happily killing stuff smooth as you like and it all clicks and you'll be like 'hell yeah this is fun' then suddenly your targetting messes up or a hitbox doesn't register or you click on something and it just refused to accept it exists (etc etc) and your ripped out of the moment and just feel annoyed that they have come so close to making something good but haven't... yet  Now for the positive bit, I will hold my hands up it is much better than I expected but then I expected it to be total garbage so take that however you want. I already own the game if I didn't I don't think I'd buy it now based on what currently exists so my thumbs down will remain. BUT if your a diablolike loot game fan there is fun to be had here just expect and unpolished buggy poorly optimised mess... before I go some highlights of awfulness in the current release version  - Character models are horrific ugly and bad - Servers are a joke, expect to attempt multiple times to connect online - And when you do connect expect random weird disconnects at times that just throw you back to the menu without any error message or warning - Expect weird messages like 'Your client timed out' and yet you can still happily play on regardless - I can already see aspects where they are going to insert their grubby cash shop and squeeze the players for money  - Balance is an utter mess both of mobs and player skills to numerous to even detail - Numerous skills simply dont work as intended - Story is so cringe inducing it feels like an emo 16 year old with a penchant for Warhammer fan fiction wrote it - Various bugs that freeze you out of the game, chuck you back to the menu or ctd even in offline mode - As of writing this servers have now been down 3 days with no end in sight due to unforseen issues, my personal theory is a major flaw or bug has been picked up they aren't telling people about cause seriously it does not take this long to roll back a database.  Now none of those are game killers but considering the developers track record of how they deal with issues and criticism yeah if money is an issue I'd hold off on this one till a few months time, its currently unstable and deeply flawed with a bad group of developers who have managed to salvage something half decent from a mess of a kickstarter and then proceeded to nearly kill it at birth with an awful launch... grats  Also see below for old review and all the features promised in kickstarter that don't exist at launch.  OLD REVIEW:Terrible terrible scam of a game... don't believe me go check out the old details on their own website for a game that used to be called Umbra.  Stay a while and listen adventurer.  Once upon a time some ambitious developers promised us the pinnacle of ARPGs, it would have full open world maps, customising everything right down to what hilt we would have on weapons, player housing and an innovative dungeon system where you build dungeons for others to challenge, a headline feature called apocalyptic form that offered a new way of making your characters unique. They kickstarted the game got lots of money and promised lots of features.  Fast forward to today the game has been scrapped and started again TWICE now, every time the goals and ambitions of the project get more and more narrow, as of the current beta they dont even have a female character model its something (and i quote one of the developers directly here) they ""Hope to add back in at release""  The list of broken promises, half truths, outright lies, bad PR, bad communication, contempt for their fans is honestly to long to go into. Just recently a forum member discovered by judiciously reading the terms of service on the new beta (or alpha v2.0 as i like to call it) that they intend to implement a microtransactions cash shop for 'just cosmetic' items. This was never in their plans, in fact as early as late last year the lead developer stated they ""Had no intention of having a cash shop"" yet here we are with them preparing to have one just like POE does, except In a full price game. Note the conflict here with the huge level of customisation they promised in the original kickstarter.  Whats more the recent beta (alpha v2.0 in everything but name) is more limited and simplistic than the original alpha we had 2 years ago. Of course go to the forums and you'll see the usual white knight brigade saying how 'its a beta if you dont like it leave' except this isn't the beta I or many other backed, they did a total 180 on us and changed the whole scope of the project to some generic Diablo rip off with boring mechanics and a cash shop. Features like housing, dungeons all that is gone never spoken of, who knows it might get implemented some time around 2050 at this rate.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY wait till they release it (so never most likely)"
96311004,english,1,424370,"I wasn't there at launch of this game so I have no animosity towards this title unlike others. My thoughts are from a single player offline experience.  Pros   -Incredible Graphics with highly detailed Items and landscapes.   -Awesome combat system   -A compelling story with epic villains.   -The boss battles   -Large variety of Landscapes and villains   -Runs quite well. Can't think of single problem I've had.    -The overall aesthetic is just awesome, a blend of Warhammer 40k and Dark Fantasy.    -Great character progression.   -Extensive campaign. Cons.   -Not a fan of having separate characters for offline and online play.   -Extensive campaign.

50524556,english,0,424370,"This review may change...  At this point the game completely changed from something unique that was promising, to a Diablo clone. I had high hopes for this and about a year ago it was good. They shifted direction so much that it's not even remotely what the vision used to be. I'm still hopeful but to be honest it's probably just gonna be a failed Diablo clone with the direction it's going.  Update:  I'm sorry but these people don't know what they are doing. I've had this game for a long time and in the beginning it had so much potential with cool new ideas, beautiful artwork, open-world exploration, a skill tree that seemed to have limitless customization and a lot more than I'd rather not get into considering most of all of that is completely gone and replaced with some cookie cutter wanna-be Diablo clone and it's depressing. I don't recommend buying this game to anyone considering. Wait until it is fully released IF it ever is fully released. They have scrapped everything original about this game and restarted with nothing to write home about.  Update#2: Still trash. Nuff said...  Update#3: Still trash. These people really just screwed themselves. Should have stuck to making something new and not cloning other games. Kinda sad..."
92514356,english,1,424370,"Over 70 hours of gameplay on the clock, so thought it time to review this game.  TL;DR - This game is an excellent example of an ARPG/Hack-and-Slash. It may have its origins in a Diablo/Path of Exile clone, but it is far more than that and I'm actually preferring it to them. It's great fun and probably worth the full price. End game is best in class as far as I'm concerned - Fully realised with an actual purpose.  So, I've just completed the main game and now into end game. I'm still having a blast. Really glad I finally tried this game in spite of the negative reviews. Those reviews seem to stem from the history of a poor release and early bug scene but I can't presume to know everyone's motives. And it is a situation I couldn't blame them for either, but one I luckily avoided arriving a year late. I have encountered some bugs but they haven't been significant. It does feel like this game needs some further polish and tweaks, but again nothing that detracts fundamentally from the great game play. Players asserting this game is 'dead' are entirely unfounded, with the evidence of recent patches and regular development updates and the simple fact I am actively playing a great ARPG with friends.  It has to be said Wolcen is very obviously taking a great deal of its game mechanics directly from Path of Exile and Diablo 3. But this isn't surprising or novel. Beyond that Wolcen has its own vibe and some great little mechanics of its own. Wolcen is the most graphically beautiful APRG I've seen yet and the Cryengine works great in here. The astonishing graphics here made me realise one of the main reasons why I never completely got into Grim Dawn (in spite of playing for a couple hundred hours). Going for a classless system is interesting and I've always liked it since the days of Dungeon Siege. At the very least it stops me from feeling I'm playing another copy of some pool of classic builds. I would really have liked there to be a much greater diversity of character appearance choices to counter this because there are fundamentally no more than 5 looks per sex currently - which is ridiculous considering how easy this would be to implement. The active dodge gives the game a surprisingly enjoyable extra dimension I wouldn't, on paper, have expected to be this fundamental. It immediately brings a level of tactics and skill generally absent from ARPG games. But it also makes you feel your character more dynamic. The skills are varied, impactful and fun - some of them have real oomph to them. The ability to modify each one in fundamental ways is an excellent game choice reminiscent of Path of Exile's support gem design. One thing I have noticed so far is the game seems to encourage variability in skills and attack strategy. This means I'm using the full skillbar of 5 actions frequently in each encounter which stops the feeling of spamming one super skill continually many other ARPGs seem to fall into. Collecting them in loot drops and levelling them independently of your character is again very PoE but works well. It also avoids the frustrating trap of having to find items that will cater for the skills you want that PoE creates (although I wouldn't argue with you if you felt that was a feature). The items I have to admit I'm still getting used to, but the lack of a straight armour class stat is interesting and opens up the item collection in interesting ways. The almost direct rip off of the talent tree from PoE I just can't argue with because to me it is currently the best way of implementing this. The literal twist to it works great too. I also love the fact that this game is not built on the depressing requirement to play through 3 times to reach the end game. It was always a lame way of hiding a lack of content and story. The Boss fights so far have been some of my favourite in any ARPG. They've challenged me in the exactly the right way. The phases and pacing of the bosses have been brilliant, and pushed me to move and use space tactically. Giving characters three in-combat revives (Revive tokens) is an excellent way of preventing the frustration of an insta-kill or a simple mistake ruining the flow and experience.  The ability to modify and paint your character's gear is pretty inconsequential but is a nice touch and does, to some extent, make up for the lack of character appearance adjustment at the beginning. I also love the 'God-mode' or Avatar of Destruction. It isn't essential, but it is a heck of a lot of fun! The voice acting is generally pretty good and the dialogue is sharp and witty - some of it made me laugh out loud.  My criticisms are generally minor. Obviously they do need to prioritise fixing the bugs and improving stability - but again, I appear to arrived at the point where playability is no longer seriously impacted by any. I think there may be too many trash mobs making general progression at times seem a bit too easy. This is countered by the sprinkling of interesting elites with equally interesting abilities which at times require rapid adaptation. Despite all the interactive terrain features I would like to be able to go into more buildings and access more land features. I would also favour a little more sideline areas to make the progression feel less linear, but it's not a major issue here and there are plenty of side dungeons scattered around. Grim Dawn would be a good comparison for great map design. Overall the story campaign is very linear with virtually no side quests. Again, Grim Dawn would be a good example of how to do an interesting quest structure. I was surprised at how quickly the first two tiers of items (normal and magic) became completely obsolete, but this may be just be amnesia of every other ARPG on my part. The vendors really need to shut up after a while!  The long-term lastability of Wolcen will essentially rest upon the end-game, and I may check in again to update my review once I've played end game for a while, but basically the main game is in my opinion solid."
84601932,english,1,424370,"With a little over a couple hundred hours in game, I can recommend this one BUT, and a big but, be aware of what you're getting.  If you've read any of the other reviews then you're aware that the game is a buggy mess and the balancing issues are a work in progress, so I won't go too much into them; everyone else already has.  Considering the game has almost been out for a year and some bugs that I encountered on day one are still in the game is alarming.  But improvements have been made to both bugs and balancing so I guess there's something to be said for that.  Just read the reviews and make sure you can tolerate the game in it's current state.  That being said lets talk about why I like this game.  It's Beautiful.  No other ARPG can touch it on that one.  Also, it sounds great.  I crank the volume up high when I'm playing.  Combat feels great.  When you consider that the main point of an  ARPG is to go around slaying monsters by the thousands, then you want it to feel good while you do.  And Wolcen does just that.  It truly looks, sounds and feels great to spend hours slaying monsters.  Some reviewers have commented that the end game is redundant and boring but then again so is D3 and POE in that regard.  Again, in an ARPG you just slay monsters over and over again and in Wolcen that feels better than others.  Admittedly I think they could spice things up in the end game, but it's not that bad.  Another point that reviewers often gripe about is the crafting.  It's plenty in depth enough and the rewards for doing so CAN be there.  But as may others have said, you're basically playing a lottery where you can slightly shift odds in your favor.  Some hate that because you can never get the ""perfect"" gear.  They think that with enough work and investment you should get the perfect piece.  On the contrary, I like that you can never get the perfect piece, but rather keep trying and trying and eventually a piece comes out slightly better than the last and it's an upgrade.  In other words you are constantly getting better gear and working towards perfect but you'll never get there.  I actually like it that way.  Lastly, the theory crafting and ""builds"".  For me, Wolcen hit that sweet spot between D3 and POE.  D3 is too straight forward.  There's basically one right way to play your class.  And POE, well, we all know that one.  In D3 I usually play my class as the meta for the season.  In POE I give up and look up a youtube video.  In Wolcen, I make my own build.  I play around, test and tinker my way to something that works.  It's in the sweet spot where it's not so overwhelming that you just borrow someone else's work, but its not so straight forward that you can only play the game one way.    I recommend this one, but do you research.  Read all the other reviews and make sure you know if this game is for you.  I'm posting what I like about it because maybe someone is thinking about the game but can't find anything good about it buried in all the reviews about how bad the bugs and balance are.  I'm not saying those reviews aren't valid because they absolutely are.  I'm just saying through all the problems there is quite a bit to like about the game."
63480332,english,0,424370,"Currently a buggy mess. Played into act 2 and had to restart, where it sent me back to the beginning of the game at level 25. Lost all my waypoints and quests. Wait until they fix this up and lots of people say it's stable."
84770747,english,1,424370,"I have about 108 hours into Wolcen now. There is still a lot of game breaking bugs that shouldn't exist at this stage and the campaign was so bugged that I had to play the last mission 7-10 times in a row because it bugged out. Its almost to the point the campaign feels unbeatable solely due to bugs.   That being said, I freaking love this game. I wish I could come on here and say ""its not worth the money, don't buy"" however, I cant because at the end of all the bugs is a game that has so much promise and a very engaging and fun play style for the ARPG genre.   I wont talk mechanics because you can look those up on youtube. I just wanted to be one of the honest reviewers and say, this game has play value and replay value even with the overwhelming amount of bugs and sometimes crashes (for online play).   All in all, if you are a big fan of ARPG's and want a new one to play. I can fully back that this game is worth the money. I won't try to hide its problems from the bugs. (I cannot stress enough that there are tons of bugs and am purposely being repetitive, because I dont want to be what made you comfortable purchasing the game and then not be able to overlook the bugs)  The ONLY gamer I would say that should heavily avoid Wolcen are those who are only after an ARPG for the multiplayer experience. Please do not buy if you are not intending on playing solo and trying multiplayer occasionally to see if its running decent for the night.  I am the type that will get in discord and discuss what I am finding, doing, and experiences with my friends who are also playing solo and I believe that is the type of player who will find this game to be great even through its issues.   Long repetitive ""review"" over. Hope that sheds a slim amount of light on why its listed as mixed reviews."
64157392,english,0,424370,"I normally dont write bad reviews. But this is an exception.   Today patch 1.0.5.0 dropped. What a desaster - these devs obviously have no clue what they are doing. Bleeding edge needed a nerf, no question, but they nerfed the WHOLE passive tree. They altered different skills and descriptions completely which are not part of the patch notes.   I have played 133hours since release, accumulated ALOT of gold and affinity, have 4 chars with over level 50, 2 over 70 and ALL chars earnings where ERASED to 100.000 gold each and 10.000 affinity. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? Whole progress of last week was completely wiped. Also running projects were canceled (guess what, these costs are gone too), items disappeared (quality, rarity upgrades).   When i played the game over the last 4 years since closed alpha, i had high hopes for this one. But today and after 230hours, i applied for a refund. Enough is enough.  This game is a broken, buggy mess. And the nice graphics doesnt help either.  I am done with this."
48380992,english,0,424370,"Vapourware. Buyer beware. The devs of this game would rather send threatening private messages trying to dissaude you from making negative comments, than actually communicate positively with their community.  They don't update, they don't give dates, they recycle the same promo material over and over and just make empty promises that are never fulfilled.  With these guys, it's always ""next week"" but next week never comes. Literally been a year with no updates, on a 3 year old EA product, with little to no marked improvement during that time.  Always an excuse with this team.   Save your money & take it elsewhere."

128140687,english,1,424370,"I have one MAJOR gripe with this game so far.  And that's with the limited tiny space for stash inventory. The stash inventory space amount is way too tiny for the average player.  It's extremely frustrating.  Every time I visit the Stash Inventory chest, all I want to do is log the hell off, because its so annoying. Each Tab for Stash inventory should be at least 4x to 8x as large from what it is now. People like to stash weapons and armor for other characters they create but cant because of the EXTREMELY limited stash space given. In games like this, Stash Inventory should be MUCH MUCH more, because this game depends on players, to collect items throughout their game play and you cant do that, if the player is hindered and limited in the Stash Inventory. This needs to be fix ASAP.  This is a Great game to play, and I do recommend people to play it if they like games like, Path Of Exile, Victor Vran, Grim Dawn, Lost Ark  So on and so forth.   Also IMHO, the game looks better when its dark,  because everything else glows really awesome. When you first start the game, everything is so bright, but then at a certain point when you complete a certain mission and go back to the main town, its dark and it looks really really nice. ( I like it a lot).  I was forced to play in OFF-LINE Mode, because the online mode would not let me log back on the next to when I wanted to continue the game. I made it to level 18 in online mode. I logged off because it was really late. When I logged back on the next day to continue, the game would not let me continue as all I got was a black screen instead.  So I was forced to start all over again from level 1 via OFF-LINE Mode.  Also I wish I could sell the skills instead of installing the skills I don't want. This game forces players to install the skill first in order for you to sell the extra skills for Primotial. Which is very annoying. I SHOULD be able to sell the skills if I don't want them.   I have more stuff to say,  but I will continue to play first before I add onto this review. Again, This overall is a great game to play for those who have not played it yet. It just has a few things that are very annoying.   Thanks for reading."
107917693,english,1,424370,"[h1] Solid ARPG Experience [/h1]   [b] History [/b]   This game has come a long way since its Early Access days. As reflected in the Steam user review ratings, it has been a rocky road for Wolcen Studio and their flagship title. I've played it off and on since very early in its development. I've seen it go through some major changes and overhauls. The game we have today resembles the original very little. At one point you could even build your own house to display your trophies. It seemed that Wolcen didn't know which direction to go.    They wanted a dark and grim fantasy world ARPG. Hardcore gamers themselves, they wanted to make what they thought Diablo 3 should have been, a lofty and admirable goal. It took them some time to figure out what the fans wanted, but they did, and now it finally shows. This is one of those titles that would have been better off waiting for full release rather than making it available in early access, since current ratings reflect earlier stages of the game. It's a win for players, but the devs take it by way of long-standing negative reviews that remain long after they become irrelevant.    What we ended up with here seems like a compromise between the dev's vision and what the fans wanted. The game is much more like D3 than the devs would probably like to admit, right down to the voice actors and their lines. [url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2478830/] Carla Tassara [/url] ,who apparently does all the female lines in every video game now, is still ""unstoppable!""   [b] Current [/b]   A little history out of the way, the game is currently a solid ARPG experience that fans of the genre are sure to love. If you were disappointed by the early state of the game, now is a great time to dive in and start working a build. A big endgame update is on the way this month, offering 4 new game modes, and I'm excited for that.    What makes Wolcen different from D3, Grim Dawn and PoE? The classless build system. You choose a starting weapon and from there you can adapt your build however you like. Stats are determined by items, equipment and gear. You get your 10 attribute points per level, and passive skill points, to allocate however you like. Certain gear set-ups allow you to hybridize and optimize across different skill sets. You can use both magic and melee if you want. And you can switch it up at any time. This allows for an unprecedented level of freedom in your build. So far I've made a Void Witch, a Toxic Assassin, a Blood Baron, a Holy Crusader, a Pyromancer, and more, some of them from the same character.   Skills and abilities have real impact, they feel nice and weighty, very satisfying to play. Certainly there is a difficulty curve between mobs and bosses. Clearing mobs is no indicator of your ability to take on a big boss. While I haven't had to grind over already tread paths, the option is there if you need it. If you falter at the bosses, it is 100% your build, which is easily remedied by grinding and/or trying something different. The latter is not easily achievable, if at all, in other games in this genre. In Wolcen, you can switch up gear and tweak stats a bit, and voila! a whole new class to try without starting a new character.   The game looks amazing, built on CryEngine, it is more detailed than any top-down isometric I've ever played. It is truly stunning to explore the different environments. The gameworld is a work of art, and the 3D models for everything from gear to actors are no less aesthetic. This is a labor of love and it truly shows.   If you tried it before and walked away with a bad taste, try it again, you will be pleasantly surprised. Wolcen is a must-play for any ARPG fan.  *My ReShade preset [url=https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/11817/] Wolcen Grit RTX [/url]"

94006446,english,0,424370,"I came into it initially positive, but largely unsure of what I was getting myself into. I had a few thousand hours in PoE at this point and had recently burned out on D3. Suffice to say, the initial experience was very good - in fact, I'd say this game is honestly ahead of the curve of the current crop of ARPGs. It looks and feels like a next-gen ARPG in the vein of PoE2. I was very impressed with the game overall...right until I finished the main story. The story starts out alright, continues to be alright with some questionable plot twists, and then completely crashes and burns because of Heimlock. Not spoiling anything, but he's the most bullshit character ever written and the last 20 minutes of the story drove me continually more and more insane until the ending made me scream and still remains my favourite thing to rant about to anyone who will listen.  Beyond that, my experience up to that point had been very good. The ability system works well and allows for decent customisation, but there are some egregious cases of absurdly powerful combinations. Combat is very dynamic with an emphasis on using every one of your skill slots for a purpose, and dodging is just nice to have. Bosses are...mostly well designed, more readable, more convincing and more involving than some of PoE's bosses, but also easier to cheese. I did however find fault with targeting being horrific especially for melee, I continually found myself either running circles around what I wanted to attack, or being unable to stop attacking a target to interact with something or attack the thing next to it; it just never does what you want it to. Pacing feels a little weird, as there are groups of enemies predictably spaced out with considerable distance between them throughout every area, and on top of that enemy variety feels lacking with a lot of mooks wearing different shirts. There is also a distinct lack overall in abilities to use which hinders the variety in playstyles, The passive skill tree is a nice idea implemented poorly, with a mess of passives that seem to have no distinct rhyme or reason to what stats they give you or where they lead, often with notables that contribute very little to your build in comparison to just dumping points in random passives that lead nowhere. Oh, and Aspects of Apocalypse exist. Don't get hyped for them, they're almost completely useless after you beat the main story, because they don't scale with your character. All your stats are set to 0 when you activate them and your gear has no effect, so you'll rapidly outgrow their capabilities and they'll serve only to give you a temporary HP boost if you're in a bad spot.  Endgame feels like a pointless exercise, which may sound rich coming from someone that played D3 and PoE, but hear me out. You are to rebuild the city of Stormfall by way of constructing notable building projects and launching Expeditions, which are three randomly generated dungeon stages that can be modified for greater rewards by spending a small sum of gold or using a map item. Completing them grants Productivity which is scaled by your finished city projects and the difficulty of the expedition. There are a large number of projects to undertake which either grant you bonuses directly, like increased gold and magic find or unlocking an extra ability slot, or open up greater crafting options and new shops. The problem is...I can't find a point to any of them. There is no real goal that you're working towards other than ticking all the boxes on the Stormfall map. D3 wasn't much better so I can't say much there, but PoE is in a different league (haha) to Wolcen. Where Wolcen asks you to just pootle around doing whatever until you get bored, PoE tantalises you with bossfights, extra story, unique items and of course, better and more loot. For a time it was a big deal working your way to the centre of the Atlas to fight and beat the Shaper, and if you wanted to get that far you had to grind your map progress, push yourself and refine your build to perfection. In Wolcen...there's no drive. You can stay fighting level 40 enemies forever if you want, because there's not much reason to go any further. Maybe if you're an obsessive completionist you'll find fun here, but I've already burned out on it very rapidly twice over.  Lastly, a note on Bloodstorm, bugs/performance and ongoing development: I've played through the game twice, before and after Bloodstorm, and burned out on Stormfall restoration shortly after starting it both times. Bloodstorm is a...rather underwhelming update that adds a league-style mechanic to the base game and expeditions that's slightly neat but feels mostly inconsequential, and includes a new side story completely unrelated to the absolute bullshit main story that I doubt will ever be addressed. Supposedly it included a lot of performance updates and bugfixes, I've never had any noticeable issues with either in the past or recently but I've seen a lot of reviews slamming the game for terrible optimisation and game-breaking issues, so YMMV. As for development...I bought and played the game a year ago, and so far it seems the side story, league mechanic thingy and some new areas are the only new content they've brought out. There's been some tweaks to the passive tree and updates to abilities, as well as the aforementioned bugfixes, but otherwise it seems to have been fairly stagnant and I wouldn't hold out hope for things to suddenly turn around.  TL;DR, it's a decent game for a while, but is shallow and trying desperately to cover up its lack of development and refinement. Worth buying on sale if you need an ARPG fix, but it doesn't feel like it rewards your time investment in the end. It just feels like the developers dreamed up a vibrant world full of characters and lore and spent all their budget on voice acting and visuals, then realised this alone wasn't going to make a game and the remainder of the time and budget was spent piecing together an ARPG. Also screw Heimlock, all my homies hate Heimlock."
48979517,english,0,424370,"Reasons for my thumbs down and I refuse to re-review this game with any other ratings. Wouldn't doubt if I was perma banned after leaving my review.  - Devs are passive aggressive and very rude. - Numerous promises made to implement different mechanics or ideas into the game. - Updates are extremely slow and they dont give you any sort of information when they occur. - Same promo material gets recycled over and over. - 3 Years of early access and the game is pretty much in the same state. - 20 bucks for 1 hour of game play in early access is not worth the cost. - Same content keeps getting ""reworked"" time and time again.  Do not buy this game. DO NOT. Until the devs get their head out their a$$"
190762850,english,0,424370,"Developers abandoned the game and it is not finished. DO NOT BUY.  I bought the game years ago to support development with the intention to play it when complete but instead they gave up, took the money and ran."
69078465,english,0,424370,"[b]3rd December update: Fabled patch 1.1.0.0, Bloodtrail. Tons of things have been reworked, added and there seems to be significant differences. But performance seems to have been downgraded, game stutters, audio disappears, there's still multiplayer lag, visual bugs and glitches, progress stopping bugs and glitches and worst of all, loss of progress in offline mode. Better luck with the next patch. And any kind of communication from the developers is still non-existent. I don't think they're even considering cakes.[/b]  Publishing $20 extended soundtracks when your game, which was promising, is in a rather sorry state, lost most of it's players faster than DC it's audience after the Martha/Moustache fiasco, is still fuller of bugs than a medieval rat catcher's straw bed after a week of work, has an almost non-existent and pointless endgame and your communication with what's left of the playerbase (your loyalists) on all fronts is in the ""Let them eat cake"" area is an absolutely brilliant business decision. Best guess? You're trying to upstage Sean Murray in a few years time? Yes/No/Maybe?  With that out of the way, should you buy this game in it's current state? Short answer, no. There's nothing on offer here that you can't get in Path of Exile, Grim Dawn or even Last Epoch, which is in early access, but cheaper and with a more responsive team behind it.  After 90 hours, and some time spent in the endgame (up to lv139 expedition, no point in going any further), the expeditions became boring. The town building aspect the game features in the endgame is a good idea and fun in the beginning, but once you realize most buildings have no actual effect on the gameplay and those that do don't really change anything, it becomes a wasteful time sink. As does the ""crafting"" system the game features. It's hilariously expensive, ineffectual and has more in common with Konami's gambling machines than any actual crafting. The loot drops and upgrades are less epic than the reception Epic Games Store recieved when it opened it's flimsy doors, legendaries are underwhelming and unique items are almost completely useless apart from a few which are almost mandatory for useful builds.  The game features a passive skill tree which will be immediately familiar to any Path of Exile players with a few extra twists. That's a lot of skills and possible variations. Too bad most of them are useless and using them will effectively gimp you in the endgame, thus forcing you to use the same skills and builds (or at least similar) everybody else does if you want to progress to harder expeditions. The summoner builds were grossly underwhelming, with horrible AI and terrible scaling, but this seems to have been addressed in the latest patch (1.0.14, May 13th). Active skills are based on enneracts that are buyable in town and drop as loot from monsters. Skills can level up and have modifiers which you can mix and match, but not all the modifiers seem to actually be working, even after a few patches.  The combat controls are wonky, that's the best way to put it. There's something off with them and there's a visible delay on skills firing off. You can see the on-screen button getting pressed when you press the keyboard button, but it sometimes takes a few presses for the skill to actually register. ARPG combat is usually fast and frantic, but targeting in Wolcen really doesn't help with that. There were times when I clicked on a mob and the character never did anything or went to pick up loot which was near the mob I clicked. I even witnessed a character unable to attack a mob because he was in the middle of it and I had to ""move out"" of the mob to attack it. There's a dodge mechanic in the game based on a stamina system that's equally wonky due to animation locks and the mentioned skill delays. There's a very noticeable difference in difficulty between normal mobs and boss fights and it's somewhat ridiculous and poorly balanced, no matter what your build is.  Champions of Stormfall (the endgame) rewards for finishing expeditions is abysmal, even the high level ones. There's no gold drop scaling with higher expedition levels. Or any scaling that actually has any effect. I've found items with a high level difference between them, but no actual improvements on their stats. Oh, and there's a thing called mandates that you can do instead of expeditions. I think I clicked on one, once, in another dimension? Grinding out the town building part is tedious with no promise of any substantial or even noticeable rewards. Experience gains also drastically slow, to a snails pace, somewhere around lv 70, maximum level is 90. There's some serious grind involved getting to 90 (badly padding out the game in lieu of non-existent endgame?), like working in a mind melting office job.  The game also touts something called the Aspects of the Apocalypse, ""...one of the 4 Celestial incarnations available, each of them offering 4 different skills, and one devastating ultimate"". I've used it exactly once and it was part of the story. It was supposed to be something useful, useable and fun. It came out as useless, underpowered and completely forgettable.  The only redeeming quality, if I can call it that, is the game's visuals. They're really top notch for today's standards, but the performance is all over the place. I've had serious FPS drops on an RTX2070, 32GB of RAM, i7 and an SSD.  There were, there probably still are, a lot of good ideas for this game, but it went haywire somewhere. The main game page still has ""...regular updates and seasonal events..."" and a long term commitment statement from the developers. They've done a couple of small updates (which are around 3GB in size, go figure) which are purportedly fixing bugs and they've laid out some kind of a longer road map (catch-all term in the gaming industry nowadays), but there's a lot of work here in the controls, balancing, itemization, scaling and getting some goodwill back from the larger part of the community. The ethereal 1.1.0 that the developers promise is a long way away. The review will be updated if something actually changes.  Take a peek inside the newly opened [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/thecabinetofcuriosities/discussions/0/2272575584124463561/][b]Cabinet of Curiosities[/b][/url] if you like to walk off the beaten path and only sometimes return to the main roads.

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30168383][b]Follow the Average Achievement Hunter Curator for reviews and useful information on Steam achievements[/b][/url]: One achievement is almost impossible since there is no gold drop scaling with expedition levels, ""Pick up 400 million gold with one character"". In 90 hours, I managed to get ""Pick up 1 million gold"". That's a loooot of hours the developers intended for you to play this game. There's three achievements for getting to level 30, 60 and 90 without dying. Since the experience gain flutters out like a candle in the wind past 70, getting to 90 without dying might prove a slight problem. The others are pretty much self explanatory and no real problem. One is bugged (at least it still was when I got it in 1.0.9, there's been a few patches since), Princely Patronage, it popped when I only built one building, not all three required for the achievement."
64199029,english,0,424370,"As I said before, I came back after the Arise Patch for a rework of my review. So this was updated at 9/11/2021:  I did a whole new campaign playthrough as a summoner character. I finished the campaign at level 38, played 5 random dungeons after that, but since my previous progress was saved, there was no reason to keep grinding for the irrelevant city-building mode of the endgame. So I played about 10 hours in the new patch.  Summary: it still looks decent. The controll for range characters are ok, but please don't play melee, it's a mess.   Now that almost all technical hurdles have been solved, the real problems of the game come to light. There is still no motivating item system. I hated it when any red items were dropped (legendary), because I always knew that they didn't contain any character development or interesting properties. I only found 11 uniques in my 82 hours and since I picked up every single one I can say that they are all full of interesting to read but completely incomprehensible properties and I didn't find a single unique that made me stronger. That's why the uniques lie unused in the box. Even after more than 80 hours I usually can't tell from the itemstats if this one makes me better or not. There are simply too many incomprehensible properties and virtually no development through the items.  For whom is Wolcen in this state suitable? For people who love ARPGs but have already tasted everything else? No, because a new saison of Diablo 3 or a new character in Diablo 2 are simply much more fun. Diablo 3 plays several scales better, especially for melee characters, and Diablo 2 has such an iconic item system that every unique drop creates a moment of joy. Ergo, I can't think of a target audience.  Is it still possible to make Wolcen a success? From a developer's point of view, I think so, since they now have a reasonably stable technical base. But since the developers don't publish a roadmap, that shows that they have understood the real problems, I don't see enough insight here. Maybe you should buy the game to finance a 2nd part which will take care of the problems of the 1st part right from the beginning.  Yes I will comeback after the next content patch release for an updated review."

180612086,english,0,424370,"Wolcen is a mess of a game. I recently picked it up after they announced Online Play was being shuttered. As such, this review treats Wolcen as a singleplayer experience.   Wolcen has a solid foundation. It has decent moment-to-moment gameplay with satisfying combat and movement and decent character progression. The skill tree has an interesting ""rotation"" mechanic, allowing you to rearrange it to suit your needs. Your active skills have modifiers to their behavior that can be freely switched at any time, similar to Diablo 3's skill system. This opens the doors for lots of experimentation and varied behavior in skills. Gear crafting was almost cool, but the complete lack of transparency made it more frustrating to use. Voice acting made the admittedly cliche story much more engaging. The post-game has a cool ""city-builder"" gameplay loop, but it doesn't feel fully fleshed out.  The progression system's negatives begin to show themselves in the endgame. Many mechanics like multiple projectiles don't work properly, pets are an after thought, a loot filter is sorely needed, and leveling past 70 is a snooze without using cheats. Most stats are ""score based"" in their design, meaning they become less effective at higher level zones to artificially increase the difficulty by making your character weaker. Your crit/resistances/dodge rate/ailment application all get less effective the more you progress, bricking builds that rely on them. Enemy resistances also scale this way, with no way to shred them, which makes life leech less and less effective as you progress. You also cannot swap weapon sets, or save loadouts for skills/transmogrification, which would have been a great QoL addition.  There's a lot holding back Wolcen technically. The final cutscene of the game fails to load, skipping you to the credits. The UI doesn't always behave, where you can't pick up items or select certain UI elements, sometimes locking you in a menu. Animations are rough around the edges. The difficulty of the campaign needed to be cranked up a ton. It just got boring quickly even on max difficulty, despite the scenarios and maps being fairly well done.   For most people, I don't recommend picking up Wolcen. If you're morbidly curious, or starved for ARPG content, it's good value when discounted under $10."
134648264,english,0,424370,"The new company that took over from the old one had a great chance to create some momentum for themselves & the game. Finally completing the story mode after 3 years is not something to be taken lightly, especially after inheriting the original devs' mess.  Several years of dev ignorance & being passed onto a new team, Wolcen had the opportunity to give us something to play for some time before Diablo 4 launches. They had opportunity after opportunity to blow us away. They still have not.  Everything bad I remember from Wolcen launch version is still all I see in Wolcen 2023. I started fresh with a new Offline toon - deleted the one I hadn't touched since February 2020 - and nothing has changed, nothing has improved.  The general consensus is that the latest patch that includes the elusive Chapter 4 somehow made the game even worse than it already was. Existing bugs still exist, and they've managed to create more new ones. In short: it's an absolute disaster. But I wanted to see it for myself.  I stuck with Offline mode because I recall the online servers being a complete mess, and people are still reporting game-breaking bugs left and right today. No thanks. Not that Offline mode is much better. When you imagine playing offline, you think of zero lag and much faster response time because you're no longer subject to online ping. Right?  WRONG! The godawful input lag of about half-a-second I remember from February 2020 is STILL present after 3 years. Spell casting is still slow and sluggish regardless of your increased attack speed, and general movement is still like walking through thick mud. Optimization is still the sheets.  Then you have STILL the amateur mistake of a fully uncovered zone map. It completely ruins your sense of Exploration AND wastes your time by almost forcing you to walk around in circles, because you can't tell if you haven't been to a certain map location before. And if you're the type of gamer who likes to explore every inch of the map to see what you can find & use as you level up, it's a HUGE problem.  And then, everything I hated about Wolcen launch version still present in Wolcen 2023: ITEMIZATION.  Nothing is worth farming, every item in the game is a BORING stat-stick with not a single interesting affix to speak of. Skill damage increases over time the more you use it, and you tweak it further with various nodes you unlock during the skill levelling process. And that's all in regard to skill customization.  What the different versions of Wolcen team always fails to grasp is: In games like this Loot-hunting is half the fun, finding exciting new items and affixes that potentially alter your personal play-style and increase the Fun factor. Take that away, and you lose half the fun, because gear choices hardly matter.  Furthermore, it completely kills Replayability. There's nothing worth farming, so you have no reason to keep playing. You complete the story mode once and then you toss the game in the trash, which is exactly what I did 3 years ago when I completed the incomplete story. And what I just did once again, for good.  Thankfully I bought the game for 20 bucks when it was still called Umbra and it was during its alpha phase, when it had the most potential with its rotating camera view & awesome unique elemental staff attacks - both of which were removed from the game in the transition to Beta & mediocrity. I feel sorry for those who paid full price for this, especially long before today.  I feel even more sorry for all the early Kickstarter backers who were promised open-world exploration, a fantastic character creator, in-game housing, and lots of other great features. None of which survived the transition to Beta & the live game. Basically, we got RIPPED OFF.  Such a damn shame, tons of potential. Looks fantastic, great skill graphics, gorgeous level design & crisp textures, all Wolcen needed is a dev team with a clue. So many years later, still fresh out of that."
182251489,english,0,424370,"Imagine selling over one million copies of your game within the first month of release, and you take the money and run four and a half years later, all the while your game isn't even finished. Fuck this company. Enjoy your yacht."
76394952,english,0,424370,"As of 22. Sep. 2020, the game still loses connections, lags, stops working alltogether, especially in coop campaign mode. My wife and I couldn't even finish Act 1 without constant connectivity issues.  Skills don't register hitting despite being on target, coop partner stuttering backwards through the world, getting stuck on random objects..... all part of the experience right now.  Not worth the 35 €."
131169611,english,0,424370,"The last patch still didn't solve some of the worst bugs that have been around since launch.  Inventory disappearing, equipped items vanishing, absolutely terrible performance on end level maps, especially onslaught.  At least the game still receives patches but the devs seem more interested in balancing and level curve instead of game stability and game breaking bugs.  Which at this point is not a good prioritisation."
81633347,english,0,424370,"Like many, I will begin by saying I really didn't want to put this as a negative review. I picked it up at the later end of the beta, beat the beta with a friend, and decided that the game had potential. Well, it surely did.  So, my first impressions of the game were that the graphics were good, animations were a bit clunky or stiff, but the gameplay was decent. At a core it combines elements from Torchlight (damage types apply effects), Diablo 3 (arcade feel, modifiable abilities, numerous questionable design choices), and Path of Exile (Gate of Fates is the same massive unlocked stat tree, classless, abilities are functionally similar), slapped with an original stat system that worked like many other ARPGs out there. I had no real problems with some of this, but did it improve over time? No.  Upon release there were mass server issues, which basically meant the game was unplayable online. This wouldn't be a problem if the game allowed transfer of characters between offline/online. It doesn't. Never has, likely never will. I understood both of these issues to a degree, since the game exploded in popularity. I won't count that against the game, as it the problem was resolved in a time that I would consider acceptable. Still, there was a lot of negative stigma that came with this. As for characters, it's an anti-cheat measure. To be honest, I don't care for it. Grim Dawn has become my favorite ARPG by far, and my favorite game overall. I can play with my friends whenever I want, and offline whenever I want. And if I go into a pub game, I can accept someone may have item edited something in. But if I see it, I can leave. If you're hosting, you can just boot ""cheaters."" This annoys me since I have to play with an online character if I ever want to do multiplayer, and boom, I get a server in Ohio and have to deal with 79 ping 24/7. Not too high, but high enough to be noticeable. Are people going to be annoyed if this was allowed? Yes. Am I inconvenienced and annoyed? Yes. So either way, there's no real winning for the devs.  So I kept playing once everything was fixed, and proceeded to the endgame. There's no new game+, but there is Champion of Stormfall, which is a 3 stage dungeon crawler mode with the option to roll modifiers. Upgrade a city with massive amounts of resources and craft. Pretty basic, but this is where the game has (had, perhaps, since the game was just updated) massive balancing issues. I began to climb the rungs of the ladder into higher and higher levels, noting that gear level was dropping at monster levels rather than mine. This might matter in other games, but here, loot just became bland and mindless. The better majority became useless, and soon I found item level was essentially pointless. All that mattered were item modifiers, and good luck rolling what you wanted. Crafting materials followed a Path of Exile styled re-rolling system, but with even more RNG involved. Slotted gems were supposed to guarantee attributes of that gem type, but eventually I found that even that didn't matter. But after finding a red shield with good rolls, gear and dying also became irrelevant. Mechanically speaking, the game before Bloodtrail was beyond busted in terms of balance. I'll go more into detail about that below comparing the game then to now, but I quit once I reached the last possible level tier before coming close to max level.  So I reached about 90 hours, and that was when I quit. I looked back at the game, and began to think. I had built a character full tank (100% investment in the toughness attribute, all red in Gate of Fates), and was able to do enough damage to lag the game. I looked into what others had said, and why the game was mixed. Bugs were without a doubt the foremost issue. I can't offer anything there, because until Bloodtrail, I hardly experienced any, and as such, I will not speak on it unless it happened to me. So what were my problems, besides the loot above?   Abilities and damage were just years apart from each other. There's one thing for an ability being good, but enemy scaling in this game was dreadful. Bosses obtained millions and millions of HP, on top of modifiers. In the end game, I feel everything came down to Mark of Impurity. When a monster died, it had an option to detonate for damage based on its HP. The mark also had an option to spread on death- and this is where the ability was disgusting on anything. A tank could use a dagger to unlock the ability, throw on Juggernaut, and detonate whole late game waves and bosses in one combo. With enemies at level 170~ and a level 60-70 character, a boss could be one shot by pulling any 5 minions into the area, marking one, and then killing it when the boss was close. Has this been addressed? Yes. Mark of Impurity now deals weapon damage. But after running through the game with everything globally re-adjusted, everything just felt bland. After consecutive nerfs to ailment damage, mark, shifts to Gate of Fates, playing through the game again just felt bland. I tried doing a lifesteal dual wield build, and to cobble together something from it, but values are just incomprehensibly low now. Investing one point in agility gives 0.1% attack and casting speed, with 10 attribute points per level. So it went from one extreme to the other, where one everything was just too explosive and sometimes satisfying, to changes feeling so minute that the difference between Bleeding Edge (a rotating axe spell) and Wrath of Baapheth (Kratos style advancing chain blades) was ""do you want to walk forward and deal 250 damage, or stay still and deal 240 damage?"" This just dulled down the overall feel and made nothing feel like it mattered. Leveled up? 4% more HP and 0.5% global lifesteal as a major node.   This is already a wall of text near the limit, so here's a cut down summary:  The devs reacted a bit late to this problem, and Bloodtrail wasn't the solution. They tried, but the game was just in a mediocre spot. They released a massive balance patch, but it didn't change the basic issues the game has. There an essay I could write on strange decisions (the tough enemy modifier, crit scaling down with player level), but all of that's wasted. I was patient, and I wanted to like this game after it was patched. So I watch for an update, and then here it comes. Bloodtrail. I hoped for a new act for the story, but hey, a revamp of almost all stats in game, player and enemy. And behold, one whole playthrough and I don't feel like playing anymore. What was Bloodtrail, really? A Path of Exile league. OId characters became legacy, and new ones were needed to play it. For me, it even added more bugs as the final boss decided to leap into the void twice in his second stage, forcing me to quit to the main menu and reload. And new crashes for no apparent reason, along with glorious audio bugs that basically muted the game. I beat it deathless in my second run, and I'm done waiting for fixes. It's time to watch Last Epoch, and hope it doesn't turn into this.  I know this is a lot of negativity, but I will admit, the game doesn't feel like it was hollow like some assembly line cast metal piece. It felt like it had some heart put into it. So if a dev ever reads this, I want them to know that you did make something interesting. Even if the animations feel like those Chinese YouTube mobile game ads (sorry), the writing may feel it a bit cheesy at times, the art style was good. Enemies were well done, and each faction was visually distinct. Sound design was fine, and environments were pleasing most of the time. This was far from a dumpster fire, and there's people out there that still like your game. They might still get hate like they did before, but it's far from deserved.   This game's just not worth it, and it's not heading where it ought to be, and so I'm heading to other options."
66716231,english,1,424370,"I wanted to take my time before publishing a review of this game. It is now April 5, we are multiple patches in, and I have a lvl 78 character who is working on their last upgrade for the endgame city. I love ARPGs and play almost all of them to their endgame.  TLDR: Fun combat, great visuals, nice campaign, but a shallow endgame means this title does not have the longevity you might expect from the genre. Lots of potential, but it hasn't achieved its best yet.   Bugs: I have only encountered a few bugs in the game. Nothing I encountered was game breaking. I see lots of people struggling with issues on the forums and reddit, but by some small miracle I've avoided most (except those that impact talents and skills).  Combat: This game is slower and more deliberate than POE or D3. I find that combat is heavy. This leads to well designed boss fights that I found exciting and interesting. The addition of a stamina bar for dodging (complete with i-frames) is welcome to the genre. It allows mechanics to be designed with this resource/skill in mind. It is not your typical run and gun ARPG as both POE and Diablo have become. Combat has a weight and rhythm to it that you do not often see in an ARPG. I loved this change of pace, but this is just my preference. Further into endgame you can develop into a faster clearing build, but bosses still take effort.   Graphics: Beautiful. This game puts all other ARPGs to shame visually. I love the style, the atmosphere, and the levels. I like that skills are apparent without being overbearing (like POE). I always know what is happening on the screen.   Story: I can't believe I am saying this, but the game has a pretty decent campaign. ARPGs aren't known for their plot, but Wolcen does this very well. I think the game is worth the price for the campaign alone. I really enjoyed my run through the game and I took my time. I felt invested in the story which is antithetical to ARPGs.    Bosses: This is personal preference, but I love the bosses in this game. It reminds me of early Diablo 3 where the boss fights were mechanics driven and took a long time to complete. Act bosses are standouts. Endgame bosses are fairly repetitive.  Skills and Talents: This game has more depth than Diablo 3, but is much simpler than POE. Skills level up, get stronger, and unlock talent points to put into skill modifiers. This allows skills to morph like in POE, but in a more streamlined and easy to grasp fashion. Unfortunately, there are not many viable builds out there at the time of this writing. However, the groundwork is there for a deep skill system.  The talent tree is POE lite. There is a skill tree similar to POE, but each tier of skills can rotate to allow more customization. This is an awesome feature, yet not many builds are late game viable and the potential of this character system is not reached.   End Game: Here is where the game suffers most. End game shows glimmers of brilliance. I love the city building, but it will be too much of a grind for most. The end game functions similar to D3 rifting, but with the ability to use POE style map modifiers. Neat set up, but pushing endgame content to get to the top tier of loot can take a long time. This isn't bad, but it will likely feel like a grind. I can understand how people can get bored with end game in its current state. The lack of terrain, monsters, and bosses adds to the grind. In short, I enjoy the combat so much that it didn't bother me, but this is strictly preference.  Loot: The game has failed in this department, which will hurt it in the long run. Most great end game items are crafted through a POE lite crafting system. Materials are rare and spamming them is required for good items. Uniques are not interesting, most loot is purely vendor trash, and my best items I created myself. Without great loot to chase, the end game will lose its appeal long term. Trading doesn't exist so the economy just doesn't matter. This needs to be addressed to give the game longevity.    Overall: Wolcen is a very pretty ARPG. The combat is different from other ARPGs enough to be worth a play through. The campaign is great and the bosses are interesting. End game is lacking at the moment, so you won't sink thousands of hours into this game. There is so much potential here and pre-COVID-19 I thought the team was getting into a rhythm of patching out bugs/tweaking things. It has slowed down since mid-March, but that is to be expected with the current climate. The team did a great job with the game, but it is not a polished AAA title. It has rough spots, struggles with build diversity, and lacks a motivating end game. The systems have great roots and I expect this game to grow into a great game in the future. Right now, play the campaign and anything you get out of end game is gravy."
72772316,english,1,424370,"[h3]Two words my friend: (no, not [i]""No refunds!""[/i]) [i]""Growing Pains""[/i].[/h3]  Yup, that's the essence of what Wolcen was, and actually still is. It was born in pains and even now, after years of development it still crawls in pain. Unbalanced, unfinished, incomplete. Passives working randomly or not working at all, content missing, various bugs still present: from bad positioning (loot drops under surface) to hits not conecting opponents and so on.  Ok, now you are probably thinking [i]""Dude mistakenly pressed 'I recommend' instead of 'I don't recommend'""[/i]. No, my friend - it's not a mistake. I really do recommend Wolcen. Why? Didn't all those faults spoil my fun? No, they didn't. In fact I am having a hell lot of fun.  I don't know why but I really like this game. Perhaps it's because of its visual side? Wolcen is one of the prettiest action RPGs on the market. It's physics gives you the feeling that your character is really connected to the world and not just hanging hovering in space. Sceneries are beautiful, lots of various characters, mobs and so on. Everything made with a high detail polish. Character customisation for instance - is of the greatest: lots of armor parts in dozens of variations ready to put almost any color combination you want (different paints drop as loot).  Hack and Slash is about two things for me - combat and loot. Wolcen offers a great combat - especially magic. Spells are just awesome. Their power, animations and effects - game gives you the best in it's genre.  Then what about the loot? It's right there. Perhaps not a variety like in other H&S but it's good. Wolcen focuses on rare and legendary item builds (think of it like blues and purples from WOW or Borderlands, the difference lies in number of its abilities). There are also uniques but these are a bit different. They are not a build openers like in Path of Exile where you create a whole build around one item. Here they have their unique abilities but in fact they are just a nice addition to the game, nothing ground breaking. There are no set items at present in Wolcen and I think it's good. Why? Two reasons. 1st - I don't like being limited in selection of abilities offered by set items (after all it's my choice what to use, right?). 2nd - Sets feel very 'final' to me. When you finally complete one, some emptiness comes and you start to think ""Well, so it's done"".  As I have mentioned before, the content is still incomplete. Right now the main campaign fits in 3 acts and they are quite long. At the time I'm writting these words we're pending the next big content patch (hopefully) that is supposed to add next chapter to the game and various optimisation fixes. Personaly I can't wait to it.   In the meantime there is the end game and it's content is not so shabby (compared to other games). In Wolcen it comes in two forms: Mandates and Expeditions. The first one is just a single mission, a random map with a simple task (usualy to kill a number of opponents) that is rewarded with an item, some experience points and gold. Expeditions are more complex. They offer you a fixable level of difficult resulting in better loot drops and amount of experience and gold reward.  There is one more thing in the end game - a micromanagement of the town. You can raise new buildings and they will open new features and enhance character options. Resource that is used for buidling is called Productivity and comes from doing Mandates and Expeditions. It's a nice addition to the game but nothing extraordinary (rather a gold sink and a grind machine for completionists).  Current Metacritic score for Wolcen is something around 60% but most of the bad reviews focuses on technicals - weak optimisation, various bugs resulting in crashes, freezes, poor performance etc. I know that from my own experience, I've also struggled with crashes, memory leaks and so on but in the end I kept coming back to Wolcen. It has this indefinable fun factor that adds ""Just one more map/level/mission!"" thing. Game isn't flawless, actually it has few strong downsides but.. I still like it."
63730788,english,0,424370,"I'm not going to sit here and bore you with the server issues there's plenty of review stressing this.   unfortunately alot of the review tend to skip alot of core gameplay issues that  needs to be addressed , my review is going to touch on a few things that ruins the experince of this game for me personally.  1. Balance issues * so to start i want to touch on the stats balance. first off i can safely say ferocity and toughness is just flat out better in every way. leveling wisdom for ailment status chance is okay but it feel more efficent to just stack ferocity and ignore that stat all together. agilty is extremely weak with only giving attack speed. the attack speed you get tends to be underwhelming considering vast majortiy of your damage is coming from skills and makes usign a right click build (in most cases) feel clunky and not worth it at all.  *class balance feels really bad. SPELL CASTING class set ups feels extremly weak (in part with the way wisdom work in this game) the class as a whole does not scale very well at and the spells available simply just isn't that good.   Melee Rouge feels very weak as well. the amount of point you need to put into agility for your dagger to be useful is way to many and hoestly never truly feels useful. You take ton of damage which forces you to pour points into toughness and in turn take points away from agility making the agility stat just that more useless.   Warrior class is very much overtuned and more specifically Bleeding Edge is the only skill you need to plow the story and currently my late game my level 60 is still strong enough to walk thru level 70+ enemies.  it seems the devs has put alot of work into the melee warrior build with most skills feeling good to some extent unlike a good portion of rouge/spellcaster skills.    2. Skills and UI issues and game clunkiness  * I want to start off by saying that this isn't the case for every skills but for quite a few the skills simple just doesn't work. go into your game now and use sovereign shout with the modifier that stuns and try using it. IT DOESN'T FUNCTION at all (at least for me as of 02/18/2020). I'm sure you can find many more skills like this that has this issue. * Tool tips is another issue. quite a few simply do not give you enough/lacking information.  A skill that comes to mind is Duskshroud when you add the Friendly territoy ( it adds a curse effect to the skill) modifier to the skill it tells you the duration, the chance and the stack but it doesn't tell you what the curse actually do. As a new player you wouldn't know what it does without looking over reddit or a friend. * Unresponsive skills/Hotkeys. i've died a mountian of times in this game simply because my potion hotkey ( Q Key by default) doesn't respond or respond late. in some extreme cases i died with full health. only after i died the potion went off and i was down. only happen once so far but still this shows how unresponsive it is. I find myself clicking skills 3-4 times before they trigger which makes playing the game very frustrating. * Lucky for me i haven't ran into it but charaters being deleted is a issue my friends has run into. I don't know if this has been patched or fixed but just know that this exist quite commonly.   In Conclusion, i personally can't justify spending 40 dollars on this game in its current state. 19.99-24.99 maybe or if you just want to support the company. otherwise the game is sadly a buggy mess that in my opinion would be a decent beta released title, not a full release title.  so as of (02/18/2020) this game in a no for me."
111059876,english,0,424370,"I played this game at launch (2020) and it had some good ideas, but unfortunately it was plagued by bugs. Fast forward to 2022, I gave this game another shot and while some areas improved, unfortunately the game still seem to be a mess.  The graphics is probably one of the best in the ARPG genre, but gameplay wise its lagging behind a lot of the competetiors (Path of Exile, Last Epoch, Grim Dawn, Lost Ark just to name a few). Overall only buy this game if you know what you getting into, otherwise I would suggest to play the other main ARPGs."
132986006,english,1,424370,"If you re not looking for endgame content that'll last forever then, yes, Wolcen is a really nice experience from its start to the end of its current storyline.  The content is still minimal, so this is not a game you can get lost sinking 1,000's of hours in right now. However it's definitely fun, the combat system offers what the other aRPG's do not.  The developers keep breaking their promises and keep going into silent mode; except for a monthly post that often doesn't bring anything really concrete on the table but empty promises.  So if you end up buying the game I'd suggest you to get it during one of its sales."
42030496,english,1,424370,"I read the reviews and I particularly gave attention to the negative ones. It almost made me not purchase and experience the game, fortunately I did and I’m enjoying this game more than my experience with other ARPG so far.. I’m loving the graphics and also the bright environment which I think is one of the factors why I prefer this than other ARPG particularly PoE. looking forward for the multiplayer update!"
189462141,english,0,424370,"Ultimately, I can't recommend Wolcen.  In its current state, the game is as finished as it's going to get, bugs and half-baked storyline and all.  There's a history here: My understanding is that this game was, at launch, a buggy mess. A very *pretty* buggy mess, but still a mess. The devs made a lot of promises while overestimating the scope of the work to create and fix the game.  The released a final patch and then cut and run.  They posted a final update in Maty 2024 indicating the shutdown of multiplayer.  This may not be a direct scam, but it's a close as you get the classic Early Access tale of a developer not following through.  The current state of the game is playable. The story is very engaging, but fizzles out near the end (guessing because they ran out of money) so you get a sudden ""six months later"" epilogue (which is the endgame) in one of the most pivotal moments of the final act.  Combat, mechanics, are okay. Not amazing, I would say feels pretty clunky by PoE2 or D4 standards.  If you can get it for $4 and want to play single-player, that's probably worth your time, but right now the most valuable piece of this product is as a cautionary tale and a ""Remember Wolcen?"" among ARPG fans."
100843543,english,1,424370,"I purchased Wolcen when it was still Early Released and i refunded it.   Fast forwarded to now when the game was already in full launched, I decided to give it a go one more time. Honestly because I was bored waiting for other ARpg since I just finished everything else in my list.   I must say it's been fun journey to finished the solo campaign.   The good thing about Wolcen is they give you the feeling of being kickass. Think of it as Dynasty Warrior (if you ever play one) but in Diablo II format.  Sure it won't be as depth as Grim Dawn or Diablo II. But I still think it is fun to play.   Personally I think this game deserve a little bit more positive rating. After Diablo II and Grim Dawn set the bar so high, I understand why players want only the best since they gonna invested hours in it. But I feel like Wolcen is build for something slightly different, be it intentional or not. It is type of ARpg that you can just start, play for half an hour and exit. Fast pace and action is what I think the main attraction here.   Now I know people compare it a lot to PoE and LE. But I do feel Wolcen stand on its own.   The perfect ARpg might not exist. Diablo II is one of my favorite but obviously I could find a thing or two that might be improved, in my own opinion. With Wolcen, I think they should go with pre-determined class instead of open options (you'll know what I mean if you try the game) but that doesn't mean its a deal breaker for me. It just the route the Developer take and to be honest it is nice to see breath of fresh air of stats other than the traditional strength, dexterity, physical, and magic. I think most of people have complaints because they asked for something groundbreaking and fresh but cry foul when it doesn't suit their expectation.  If I may draw a comparison, this game might be better than Torchlight III (given how much I love Torchlight II) and that is something. At the very least you will feel the battle more ""engaging"" as I am short of words to describe it. I found this especially true with melee character. Every hit connect with enemy feels badass. Even compare to Diablo II Ressurected (which is not apple to apple considering how old the mechanics of D2R already). Can I suspect the player that doesn't like this game is mostly ranged or magic type of character ? Because with Wolcen I always ended up playing melee regardless my initial intention. It just feels more satisfying.   All in all, at the very least you can enjoy the graphic. Sure the game crashed sometimes. During my many hours of run, I crashed 3 times. But luckyly no equipment are lost and believed me it was fine. I honestly experienced more crash with D2R with less hours of gameplay. Luckly none of equipment is lost on both games otherwise it would have been a deal breaker.   Will I invested all of my time to play Wolcen compare to other ARpg ? Highly unlikely. I know I will come back to D2R or GD if there is nothing new and I just want to be nostalgic. But to play Wolcen one run after real life work at the end of the day is really fun. Imagine it as playing relaxing game after hours of Dark Souls (what am I talking about, obviously some of you find Dark Souls relaxing).   Oh I forgot to mentioned you can customize your own character and equipment is detailed visually. You can equip different glove of the left and right hand. As well as different set of shoulder protection. My only complaint is that why not make all the way into shoes as well so that shoes doesn't have to come in pair anymore ? But seriously, some items are just imbalance, at least in my experience. You get lots and lots of weapons, armor, shoes, etc etc but i feel i don't get enough sash. Sometimes i think i am stuck with my equipment from the start until several acts in the future before i found the better replacement. But maybe that just me.   The visual of the character is pretty much like Warhammer 40k. So if you like Warhammer 40k homage, then you'll settle just right on. I definitely have no complaint on it. I just wish we get to have two handed gun, like riffle or something because we got handgun and bow&arrow while some enemy have sniper rifle on them. Now why is that ? And also, why not put crossbow as well ?   Overall, I recommended the game. Full disclosure, I got it on discount. I think it's worth it."
61347017,english,1,424370,"I have recently purchased the game. Haven't finished the 1st act yet but even now I am very happy with the game.   Graphics looks great although is the least important thing in games (imho). The game itself is very dynamic and although I don't have newest PC (i5  3.5GHz, 8GB Ram, GF 970) I have constantly 60fps.  I like skill tree which is similar to Path Of Exile one...although easier to manipulate and diverse your path. I very much like how you level spells and chose what modifications (increased damage, area, cooldown etc it should have) It let you modify it more to match your playing style.   The story is interesting although as I have mentioned I haven't finished whole 1st act yet it is very promising.   I love the idea of building own house...yes not the most important thing in Hack n Slash but I love the idea. It gives another reason to go and drop stuff  (and it reminds me good old Ultima Online).  There is no trading yet but I hope it will be implemented.  Only disadvantage I see is description of items...at least at the beginning.  There is no info about whether weapon is 1 or 2 handed which may be confusing a bit at first. Rating of items works differently to how I thought it should- sometimes 3 star item has worse stats than 2 star item. I found some information somewhere that it is not to compare items but to say how good rolls of stat on item are...not sure here really). Stats of items could be clearer.  There are small bits that needs fixing but overall I would highly recommend the game. Can't wait for the release day."
172231670,english,0,424370,They're shutting down the multiplayer functionality of the game instead of giving enough of a damn to give one last update for the game to run peer-to-peer or through some other method that doesn't require them hosting the servers themselves.  Don't make your multiplayer portion of your game entirely reliant on your own hosted servers if you don't know if you can host them indefinitely; it's practically worse than planned obsolescence.
90317210,english,1,424370,"Summery:  The game is absolutely playable and fun. I had 2 crashes within 120 hours of gameplay and a few minor bugs which didn’t bother me at all. It's an absolutely awesome looking and sounding ARPG with almost no limitations regarding character builds. I would totally recommend the game at its current state and price for all ARPG, H&S and RPG lovers.   Hint for Newcomers: Don’t give too much attention to the bad reviews. Most of them were disappointed bakers from the kickstarter project “Umbra”. Which is justifiable because they didn’t get what they payed for. But Wolcen is NOW a good looking completely fun ARPG. Don’t get confused by the two campaigns. Just use “Blood Trail”. It’s the same as the “Lords of Mayhem” campaign but without the bugs and including the improvements of the Blood Trail patch and the following patches. The “Lords of Mayhem” campaign is meant for old “legacy” characters only.  Hint for those who want to come back: Delete all characters which you had before the “Blood Trail” patch was released. Start from scratch with the “Blood Trail” campaign and enjoy. Since I did this: (almost) no issues during 120 hours of gameplay.  Pros: -	Dynamic gameplay -	Awesome graphics -	perfect sounds and sound design regarding positioning and quality -	no class limitations -	lots of skill variation possibilities -	well sized skill tree (wheel) -	almost infinite endgame -	the first real fireball I saw in an ARPG which is actually useful in the endgame ^^  Cons: -	linear level design -	not challenging except the boss fights -       the apocalyptic form is almost useless -	Endgame: o	becomes boring  by the time and there is no specific threat or super boss o	Not enough players for a random multiplayer session atm o	Repetitive expeditions/seats"
74096451,english,1,424370,"Overall a quite decent game with really nice graphics but not near complete with some minor to major bugs, alas I have faith that WOLCEN Studio will not disappoint in the long run. Do keep in mind that it will take some time for the Developers to finish and polish this game so if you're impatient then put the purchase on ice for now.   *I MAINLY PLAYED OFFLINE*"
63390281,english,1,424370,"I was dissappointed in my purchase of Wolcen in early access almost 2 years ago. But after setting it down and forgetting about it for a good long while, suddenly i was seeing videos pop up on youtube about all of the great changes happening to Wolcen and so I gave it another try.. Wow, have they come a long ways. I haven't had this much fun in an ARPG in a good long while, and now, a day before release and having seen all of the stuff they have planned for endgame, and moving forwards is outstanding.   The gameplay is the best part for me. The attacks feel ""weighty"" and very satisfying to use. I love the hybrid system that they have in place where I can use any combination of spells, physical attacks, ranged, attacks, etc to tailor my ""willpower dumping, rage generating, rage dumping, willpower generating"" cycling of gameplay. And that was the reason why i had so much fun leveling to 20. Whenever i found a new spell or powerful new weapon, I wasn't limited to the ""Class"" i had chosen or the playstyle i had used up till that point. I could very easily pivot and incorporate this new skill or item into my gameplay and completely switch things up. This kept things fun, fresh and interesting, and I can't wait to play the full game tomorrow :D  If you liked anything about the diablo franchise, torchlight, Path of Exile, titans quest, etc etc, definitely go watch some videos on Wolcen and give it a try. I can only speak for myself, but I have spent more hours in the Diablo games than any other (World of warcraft doesnt count, haha), and I absolutely loved my time in the beta.   Hope this helps, and good luck on your leveling journey to those of you who have already purchased the game :D"
46690896,english,1,424370,"i'm not exaggrating, this is the new diablo, wolcen take off where diablo 2 left off, not because of similarity, but because it is so damn satisfying to play this, AND the upcoming beta stuff is incredible, it will revamp the game quite noicely.  Why is this thing so good?  Everything in Wolcen is simply too fun to use, even the normal left click attacks are well made, and they have different combinations, like; pistol and sword, that's right you can actually do that, you can even get an upgrade called 'Titan' on the skill line and equip two-handed weapons as if they were one handed(yay! like in d2 barbar!), so you can use a two-handed giantass axe with a pistol like a steampunk knight it all looks so damn fine.  The glorious cryengine makes everything even better.  Entire thing looks so beautiful.  Wolcen is also super ambitious, currently it is officially known as singleplayer but the multi is in tech_beta which you can opt-in for it in the settings and try it with your friends, it obviously has bugs time to time but overall it's very promising.  Speaking of Tech_Beta, it is only for testing, it has limited gameplay, but, even with limited game the reworked spells, how they look, better looking weapons, bigger axes and stuff it all just looks so awesome..  Wolcen has a great future, and i genuinely think it will be the next Diablo 2. And in my opinion it is a great honor that many people think of wolcen as good as diablo 2 was.   Edit: Well, this aged poorly."
63755684,english,0,424370,"I really wanted to recommend this one, I really did... I had a blast with it the first couple hours, experimenting with build ideas, finding new spells, and abilities, and was even getting into the mediocre story... Then shortly after Chapter 2 started the entire game fell apart.  I want to start by saying that this game has potential, and I do like it, and I would tell you buy it in a heart beat if you're reading this months after release, and you know they have fixed the problems. I'm gonna start out with the good.  THE GOOD: - Amazing Doom/Warhammer/Diablo art style, and theme. - The most refreshing take on character skills/talents in an ARPG, or better yet RPG i've seen in a while. - Unique, and thought out spells/abilities - Limitless potential for builds. There's literally room here for anything you can think of. - Feels like the first next gen arpg on the market. (for what is actually done.) - If this studio pulls their shit together Wolcen will give the big boy arpgs a run for their money.  Now lets get into what is unacceptable about this game, and why I wont be recommending, or playing it until things change...  THE BAD:  - This game has an absolutely unacceptable amount of game breaking bugs for it to be considered a full release let alone a 40$ one. This is 1st/2nd year early access level.  -  I can't make it through a single stage without getting stuck on the floor defenseless, or without the audio cutting out. The enemies are either one punch chumps, or bullet sponges from hell.   - The difficulty ""curve"" is more like a roller coaster. One minute thinking you have a decent build to the next wanting to respec, but not being able to due to the extremely low drop rate of the currency you need to respec while leveling. I get wanting end game respec to be expensive, but while leveling the rates should be WAY lower. A skill/talent system this big takes time to get used to, and find a viable build. You should be able to fix mistakes without feeling like you are being stopped by a paywall that doesn't actually exist.  - The entire game is severely unbalanced. I've seen some builds literally go god mode on this game while others make completing the game literally impossible, and with the insane cost to respec, you better hope you do your homework, or you'll be grinding before you're half way through the story. This also isn't just due to imbalance either...   - A serious chunk of the passives just don't work period, and this doesn't help the fact that there's virtually no information in the game about what each stat does there really is no way to take chances, which I think defeats the purpose of a game like this.  - If you do play, and end up making it to the end of the first chapter, and getting your angel/mech suit thing, don't pick the reaper/chaos one, because it doesn't work. I spent an hour in the chapel/holdout stage shortly after getting it watching my character jump around the screen while that horrible computer crashing audio skip blasted my ears, only the finally be stuck casting a spell for another 2 minutes, only to be dropped dead on the floor.   - There are some awful UI bugs as well. Items being dragged under the gem window, or not being able to directly drag armor from the gem vendor window back to yourself without having to drop it in your bag first, having to click a few times here, a few times there to get the ui to respond, Oh and on Ultrawide resolutions seeing editor lighting/animation cuts off the side of the cut scenes.    All in all the 15 1/2 hours I spent with this game felt like I was working QA, or playing a new early access game. Just didn't feel like it was even to a beta stage. Late alpha at best. This would be fine if this is what the studio was selling, but it isn't. This awful habit the industry has picked up has got to stop, and it doesn't matter if it's the big AAA studios, or the underdog. I don't care if you're a small studio, or not. It's a outright deceptive practice. If development didn't go as planned, and you have backers to satisfy then do the right thing, and take the hit. Release it as an early access, make some in game goodies for the loyal fans, and release it when it's ready.  Regardless of all of that I really do hope I can come back, and change this review, and I hope the devs apologize for this launch instead of just blaming the ""server load"". That's obviously an issue, but that seems to be the patsy in this case. It seems to be more of a coding nightmare/lack of QA that is really the cause of this games issues right now."
132944580,english,1,424370,"I had this game on my wish list since it came out , but after the it came out the reception wasn't great so I didn't buy it. Over the years the game got lots of updates and it was on sale multiple times but due to mixed reviews I never pulled the trigger until it was £7.70 and at that point I though if its crap I won't even mind, but I can tell you all that is not the case. I don't know when the game got to the state it is now but I don't think there has been a better time to play it, I put 50 hours into the game before I wrote this review mostly because a lot of people are still complaining and I just don't know why? This isn't a game that you will play for the rest of your life, the campaign was a little too short I can agree with that but apparently more is to come this year and the Champion of Stormfall mode will keep you busy for a good while and its miles better that silly rifts like you get in Diablo III , to me this is one of the better ARPG's I've ever played , it actually took me away from playing Diablo II Resurrected which is not an easy thing :P all in all get it especially when the priced at £15 - £20 , you will get your moneys worth especially if you get into the Champion of Stormfall Mode :-)"
129647782,english,1,424370,"Review after finishing chapter 3 on Offline mode: If you are after a isometric action rpg with tons of loot and skills, you will enjoy this. I had a bloody fantastic time playing the game. I finished the main campaign after around 38 hours. Apart from rewarding game play it comes with excellent production values including the music, voice acting, great sound effects and graphics. (The story is even okay with a nice bit of dark drama in the 3rd chapter). I had absolutely no bugs at all during my time. The game was, gratefully, on the easier side for me, though some bosses (especially the end boss) were set at a hard, though not frustrating, level.  Especially good were the ""hunts"" side quests where you make decisions along the way whether to make rare drop rates increase at the expense of making the enemies harder. They were fun. The game has suffered a lot of early criticism and negativity, I suspect mainly from early players (who suffered with a lot of bugs) and recent players who are heavily into the game+ where maybe things such as drops and skills are causing concerns. I don't know about that yet as I am only going to play game+ for a short while and wait for the final campaign chapter to be released, so I can replay the whole game again (yes it's that good). However if you are happy to play 40 hours of really great action rpg (yes I will say it..... ""Diablo like"") then this game will not disappoint. EDIT; After playing a few hours of the game+ (Stormfall) I am just realising that there is still a ton of game to be played. You are sent on missions that help you restore Stormfell and these missions also get voice acting and new areas to play.  Bosses are now really something to contend with and you will be rethinking your character all over. I love it. There is just so much content here to still be played.  This game definitely deserves more positive reviews than the mixed review status it currently has.  Further edit: Well my review remains completely positive after finishing the chapter IV content. I have now around 100 hours in the game. The final chapter was different in presentation as compared to the first 3 but still enjoyable. The content was less a campaign and more like a series of missions. But it all concluded the story well and I was not disappointed. The cinematic scenes were top quality. You basically just got more of the core gameplay so if you were happy with that so far you will enjoy this. I still have the end game to continue with and I am still motivated enough to continue for the foreseeable future. This game is a solid 8/10 BUT.... it must be played offline. Online is a complete disaster."
88610662,english,1,424370,"I wanted to play this game since release but waited because of the bad state of the game at release.  I'd been wondering when would be the right time to buy it because despite this, in context they ran out of money for their kickstarter.  Far more important to me though was that someone finally made an ARPG which isn't trying to be a straight Diablo or POE clone.  To me, innovation and willingness to be different is huge, especially in what I think is a stale genre which is ready to evolve.  First and foremost, if you're deciding whether to play this game, my advice is to set your expectations as if this were a brand new game for where the content and polish currently is.  Forget that it came out over a year ago now.  It's a very, very fun game IMO, but think of it as a fresh new game that needs time to grow out still.  I've also only been playing single player offline so far.  So...where is it now?  This is the question and the review I'd wanted to read before I bought but couldn't find.  It's hard to read past all the negativity and complaining about the game still.  The great: The action and gameplay in this game feel INCREDIBLE.  This is the biggest thing for me.  I sadly have not been able to get in to POE despite its popularity and vast amount of content because the game just does not feel good to me.  Wolcen feels almost like a hybrid of a brawler and an ARPG.  The hits have weight, weapons have different swings that you actually need to take in to account when using them.  Simply fighting with your regular weapon swings is fun, where as most APRGs it feels like you click enemies to death and ability spam.  I thought the campaign, story, and characters were *very* well written and I'm honestly surprised.  I actually cared about the characters and where the story was going.  The stats, itemization, and skill tree feel like a work in progress but are currently in a very playable and fun state still.  This is another area where I personally am giving it a ton of bonus points because, again, they have opted to not run your boring standard ARPG stat system.  At every level this game is trying to make it so that theoretically every stat can work with any class archetype you choose, and there are not nearly as many arbitrary limits on what gear or skills you can use.  The game pretty much lets you wear and equip whatever you want, the only limitation is whether you can make it work, and the game tries very hard to give you the most flexibility possible in how you accomplish that.  It is so nice to play a game where necessarily intelligence/wisdom = magic, agile = rogue/ranged, etc........even the skill trees themselves offer something for everyone in the majority of cases.  The graphical quality, art style, and animations are superb.  THE BAD, as I see it: -The worst thing for me is that the tooltips are very poorly worded and there are too many unexplained mechanics.  It's kind of bizarre actually, considering how good the writing is for everything else in the game.  It makes it harder to know what you're getting when theorycrafting or comparing items and skills -Everyone writes about bugs with this game.  I played through the campaign two full times and have been doing their endgame mode here for a while.  It's only crashed to desktop twice for me, and once I had to restart the game because it was acting wonky.  Twice I got a weird graphical bug that meant I had to quit to main menu and load again.  That's it. -*I haven't tried it myself yet* but everything I hear is that there are still some game disrupting bugs when playing MP, and at this time there is no matchmaking.    Conclusion: I love this game.  I hope Diablo 4 takes some notes from this game.  I do not say this lightly.  Part of the reason I'd waited on this game, aside from bugs, is that I was afraid that development would freeze or worse the studio would go under.  Instead, they've started posting development updates talking about upcoming content.  They promised regular patches starting in 2021 and thus far have delivered.  They even were able to hire a couple of extra people to work on the game!  I'm not ready to pause on the game yet but I see myself coming back to this game every time there is new content."
64265366,english,1,424370,"I was (and still am hesitant) to write a review for such a controversial game, but, probably 3 people will ever read this, so here goes...  Caveats: Never played an ARPG before. Saw the hype, took a chance on a genre I have no prior experience with.  PLAY OFFLINE:  I hit up offline first without much thought. I had a great gaming experience all the way up and into end game content. Really enjoyed it.  ONLINE: About 9 days after I bought this thing, I decided to try the online mode. Once there, I started to see why all the negative reviews are popping up. This dev team isn't ready for online, is my guess. I got in after a game update or two, so I missed the worst of it. Had some bugs that blocked progress coming into ACT 3, managed to work around them. That said, they shouldn't have been there in the first place.   So IF... this game looks appealing to you, and you like to play alone, buy it, and run offline mode. You will have a blast. Online is better than at release, but I can't see the future, You are on your own if online play is a requirement for you."
140910444,english,1,424370,"So I really like the GFX, the skills, the enemies, the combat. The voice overs are great, campaign is actually a good story - cut scenes are real nice. I haven't played long yet but i come here as a Veteran D2 Player, D3, D4, POE, Etc.  What I like about Wolcen is that it launched as a terrible failure 3 years ago but the team didn't give up. They have been working diligently for free since then. In an age where goliath companies like Blizzard produce over-priced garbage, i believe in the under-dog studio. Wolcen's team is trying REALLY hard to continuously improve this game with free updates and patches. I think if we stick around this will eventually be a top ARPG - it has all the right stuff to reach that level."
49815946,english,0,424370,"I want this game to succeed, but so far that is just not happening. (Please understand before assuming I'm just crapping on the game, I have a lot of time invested into it on several accounts to assist with testing things pretty heavily.)  For those that just want a short answer; I cannot recommend this game currently.  I helped Kickstart this game back when it was still named Umbra. The vision of the game back then was such a different scope than what we have gotten to now, and not in a good way. The developers honestly became extremely lazy mid-development and just decided to start copying every other ARPG on the market rather than stick to their own style and promises. There are so many aspects to why this game is failing currently even though they have now rushed a beta together to try and save-face.   1. The developers pretty much completely ignore the community.  From the start, they had a website/forums where the initial place to report bugs and give feedback was. This started out ok for the first few months of development but slowly you could watch the forum become abandoned by the developers and team of the game. Massive bugs, exploits, glaring issues etc. all started going completely ignored. When I confronted the lead developer about this, he told me ""we don't really bother with the forums anymore, we use the Steam community instead"". Yes, he literally said that. No announcement or anything on the official site, or even just closing it down, they just let people shout into the void with their bug reports and feedback all of which was completely ignored still to this day. (There are massive bugs in this game that to this day still exist that are reported on the original forums.)  Soon after, they started doing the same with the Steam forums, becoming less and less active and less engaged in the community. And again, it turned into a new place to be, Discord. Where they hardly ever talk, and never listen to the feedback.  2. They abandoned their own game in favor of copying other ARPGs.  During the alpha, the game was focused on being a unique experience for an ARPG while still having the traditional aspects you come to expect in one. This was going pretty solid for a while, we got fairly regular updates with some various new features to check out. However, this suddenly changed when massive changes happened in the team where people were fired/laid off to a point where there was only like 2 people left on the team. We got very little information about what was going on and we got a new update that basically broke the entire game for a while.  They shifted focus on their original ideas at this point to basically just stay afloat. The original alpha act 1 was scrapped and was replaced with a very lacking piece of content. Then some new hires were added and more promises began rolling in.   Fast forward to a few months ago, they completely ditched the entire game. They gave up on their own concepts and ideas, and instead completely copied Diablo 3, in almost every possible aspect. They redid everything, but used all of Diablo's ideas instead of being original and having their own game. You logged into this new alpha and were presented with a new title screen copied exactly from Diablo. The entire game mode available at this point was Diablo inspired. Skills, graphics, animations, loot, etc. were all redone to be more like existing ARPGs. The entire skill tree system was disabled in favor of a 'revamp' which turned into a clone of PoE with very minimal unique parts. New mobs were added that were literal copies of Diablo mobs (models look exactly like D3 things (ie the Butcher), the mob skills were clones of things from Diablo, etc.)  3. Massive game breaking bugs still exist, to this day.  There are a lot of massive bugs in this game that have been there since day one. These bugs have been reported multiple times across all mediums (official forums, official bug reporting setup, official Steam community and the official Discord) all of which just got ignored or simply deemed 'unfixable'.   There is a huge bug due to how the world loads because the developers do not understand how to properly handle thread synchronization. This game loads various aspects of the world during a loading screen in different threads. All fine and great for optimization, however they have no locking or syncing mechanisms in place to deal with the order things complete or when the game assumes it's ready. This means there is chance every single time you hit a loading screen that you will fall through the floor.   Here is a quote from one of the developers from a pm I had with on Discord. This was me reiterating the issue of falling through the floors in the game. (This convo was back at the beginning of the year when they released the Diablo 3 clone version of the alpha.)  ""There might be, CryEngine have a worker thread system to run some things away from the main thread. But tbh, we'r a small team and we'r making such an ambitious game (ARPG are hard..... so many game mechanics & systems... it's great and horrible at the same time as a programmer ^^) that I don't think we'll have time to take a look into this before release""  I'm not trying to out a developer or have any ill-will towards them, but this is a huge problem that wasn't new. It's been in the game from the start and is still there now. You can also cause this bug to happen in other ways by running against walls and other jagged surfaces that are blocking like walls. Eventually you will start to slowly fall into the floor, causing the camera to go absolutely insane while moving. Soon enough you'll fall through the floor or your position will never correct itself until you restart the game.  There are other massive bugs like this in the game too. Such as loot drops falling through the floor or landing up in unreachable places. Potions not reacting properly on the current 'tick' of the game, causing you to die because it'll trigger the cooldown but not heal you until the next tick and so on. This are massive glaring problems in an ARPG that are not going to fly when a lot more people start playing and finding the same problems.  ---  I really want this game to succeed. We need more ARPGs to exist and help continue to push the genre forward, but right now Wolcen is not that special thing it once was when they first announced it.   Right now, it feels more like a beta test of an unannounced Diablo 3 clone made by fans.   I do not recommend this game for the time being. I highly recommend people save their money until the Wolcen team really gets back into their own grove and starts making their own game.   To the developer I talked with, I'm sure you'll see my name and recognize me based on our in depth chat. I mean no ill-will towards you or the team. I want this game to be amazing. But for me, your current direction is not one I feel is going to make this game popular or successful outside of a small niche of people. Please take a step back and realize copying Diablo is not how to make a successful ARPG."
78320072,english,0,424370,"This game is a gross far cry of what was originally sold to backers during the Kickstarter. Originally touted as going to be an open world role-playing game with an isometric view, quests out in the world, exploration, and more. A diablo version of Skyrim. Instead we got a buggy b-rate version of Diablo with an edgy story and art that looks like a tryhard-Chinese version of the Warhammer aesthetic. Absolutely embarrassing."
64256373,english,1,424370,"There were definitely some annoying bugs on release, most all of them have been fixed (at least the one I personally encountered) but beyond that its a really fun next gen ARPG."
66703156,english,0,424370,"Wolcen is like a dish that's made with an excellent recipe using the finest ingredients.  The problem is that the dish was taken out of the oven way too soon. Most of the customers left the restaurant after being served a half baked mush and the confused chefs don't know if it's too late to put the food back into the oven.  [h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1] - Gorgeous visuals and decent animations - Environments are detailed, however could use more map variety - Servicable voice acting - Fun combat system - Dynamic class system, which allows your char to respec into anything and change your playtyle while in the city. - Certain skills are a lot of fun. - Story is alright up to Act II.  [h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1] - Act III is horrible - The game is unfinished - No real end content: Item and monster go up to 187 but you pretty much do the same once you beat the story. - End game dungeon modifiers are ridiculously unbalanced: some of them are too easy, while some of them make a run close to unbeatable  - Certain passive skills don't work as intended, and some of them just straight out don't work"
84692086,english,1,424370,"For months I've wanted to buy Wolcen and have put it off because of the negative reviews and general opinion online that it is a buggy mess. I bit the bullet during the winter sale and so far I have been absolutely blown away. It is everything I was looking for in terms of a new ARPG. The combat feels great and the visuals are pretty. The progression systems strike kind of a balance between Diablo 3 and Path of Exile. The abilities are simplified and accessible but there is an expansive passive skill tree for tailoring your build.  In terms of bugs I've gotten some occasional texture pop-in and glitched audio, but everything has been very minor. So far I haven't experienced any of the game breaking issues that other people have reported, but I'll edit my review if I do later. Either way I've already got my money's worth from this game and I would gladly recommend it to other ARPG fans."
63434878,english,1,424370,"I'm a dad, in my 30's now and don't have much time dedicated to gaming. So when I pick a game, I feel I have to choose it wisely. I'm very very glad I purchased this one. First steam review I've ever done. One of my favorites is Grim Dawn. This is now equal to that and I've only played the first couple of hours.   The graphics, diversity of spells, spell graphics (important to me) and the way the combat feels/looks is just perfect. Really great job, devs. I'm gonna spend a ton of my free time on this one!  EDIT: You absolutely should not purchase this game as of 2.19.2020.  It's important to know that this game is not in a playable/enjoyable state at the moment. My initial review was based on open beta game play after 3 hours. Once launched, the game was quickly taken offline for 3 days due to unexpected database issues due to a massive influx of new players. There are so many bugs that many consider game breaking and it's flat not worth $40.   Bugs that you will encounter as of this review: Loot/Stash disappearing, Item/gold duplication, unable to basic attack certain mobs, end game monsters not dropping any loot, damage modifiers not actually modifying any damage, potential for complete character wipe and completely bricking your game open completing final act boss.   *Before you purchase, please go to the /r/Wolcen subreddit on Reddit and look up the current state of the game. You've been warned. Come back a year from now and I'm sure the game will be great."
57229570,english,1,424370,"[i] DISCLAIMER [/i]: I backed this game back in 2015, played here and there during it's changes, I liked some of the changes and didn't like others. This game is much different in 2019 than it was then, and most of the negative reviews are based on that. As you can see I'm approaching 200hrs played in early access, and I might just hit that mark before release because of how enjoyable I have found the game, especially the recent patches. I'll layout my pros and cons for what is currently available and then my optimism for what is coming.  [h1] Pros [/h1] -[u] Visceral action: [/u] This is an ARPG, and you want to feel the impact of your skills when killing enemies, and I feel Wolcen does a very good job here. I've mostly been playing melee and ranged builds, haven't really dabbled in magic yet, but the attacking skills are hefty and satisfying. I'll also add that the audio for the skills is great, and I particularly love the ""plug plug plug"" sound of the auto-turrets.  -[u] Itemization: [/u] Loot, loot and more loot! What more can you want from a hack and slash looter? Starting out lvl 1 in the campaign each found item is a treasure, wondering if it's an item that fits into what you are planning to play or you find something that completely alters your plan because it's better or build defining in this classless system. Once you start finding rares and uniques the game really kicks up! But once you start finding legendaries, oh boy do the min-maxing demons come out, and I love em'!!! So far in this iteration of the game these red items, basically rares on steroids, are often best in slot, and the grind to get them is a ton of fun. Anything red that drops on the screen is a potential small to huge upgrade for your character or another build, and then sometimes; but as with any game looter, there's the chance that item just rolled all the wrong affixes and is useless.   -[u] Skills: [/u] I mentioned above how I felt the skills are visceral, and you feel their impact. Here I would just like to mention that I feel the current group of skills we have access to (24 in total) are pretty darn good. The animations and artwork of the skills is great, and I do love the rune system that is in place. For those who are reading this review having not yet played the game, so far each skill lvls up to 20 (same as current level cap) and you have 20 points to allocate between the associated runes for the skill. Some runes cost 4 points (minor) and some cost 8 (major), and this will determine how you use the skill compared to another player using the same skill. It's fun and allows for a lot of build variation.  -[u]Passive Tree: [/u] The Tree has 3 rings (2 at the moment) in the first ring there are your basic ""class archetypes""; soldier, sentinel (rogue) and a mage one (forgot the name). The next ring has 6 ""sub classes"" and these are where you start to get builds being defined. The 6 branches of the second ring are the: Assassin (dodging, single target dmg), Ranger (projectiles and ranged attacks), Elementalist? (elemental damage duh), Cabalist (damage over time oriented), Warmonger (physical damage), alongside the Praetorian (tanky boi). Now the really cool thing about these rings is that they are not stationary, so you aren't stuck going in one path or needing to spend 10 points just to get to your desired 2nd ring, you can rotate the rings to set them up the most efficient way for your build!   -[u] Attributes: [/u] You gain attribute points per lvl that can be put into Ferocity, Toughness, Agility and Wisdom. You will find yourself sometimes doing a little mixing and matching to perhaps hit break points, or your build might only require you to dump all points into one. It's dealer’s choice sometimes and is often very dependent on gear you find and certain passives you may have chosen. Wolcen is finding a nice happy, and functional medium blending attributes, passives and itemization together.   -[u] Campaign [/u]: I found the first act to be rat her enjoyable, and the story to be easy to follow and so far, well thought out. The art and environments are great. Not the open world that the game used to have, but I do not find it detracts from the gameplay that much. Looking forward to Acts 2 and 3 on launch (hope they have a bit more content than Act 1), and the following Acts that are to be FREE DLC.   -[u] Soldier of Fortune and Wrath of Sarisel: [/u] So these are the current endgame content for the game. [b] Soldier of fortune [/b] you get to push higher and higher monster levels with the incentive of increased loot drop quality and quantity. You can add modifiers to these runs to make it more difficult but increase the reward. in SoF loot drops from everything, but you don't get the ""reward"" until you've completed 5 runs.  For [b] Wrath of Sarisel [/b], when making an SoF run, once you add all the modifiers you can lure ""tainted"" monsters that will chase you down and do what they can to kill you. These guys are basically assassins that can really mess you up. These runs are a mix of speed and kill runs, as you want to clear mobs as quickly as possible to kill the bosses so you can get a high rank at the end of the run, I believe that the higher the rank the better the loot (doesn't always seem to be the case). However, these runs offer loot that doesn't drop elsewhere. Loot from these runs can roll affixes like a Bow allowing you to use the melee oriented Bladestorm (Whirlwind). This affix might be cool and interesting, but maybe not useful. But finding a shield or a sword that allows you to use spell casting skills as a melee character can be build RE-defining.   -[u] Social/Trading: [/u] The big thing though is you can trade anything and everything with your friends. Even if you found something while playing solo, you can give that to your buddy who is just starting out. I don't mind a system like this, I prefer it over nothing, or something so limited its frustrating (D3 trading...blech).  [h1] Cons [/h1] -[u] Skills: [/u] some skills I found we very slow to cast, like Arrows Wail, which is hail of arrows type skill, and the casting time for the skill seems a bit long as enemies tend to be able to close the gap during the cast time. This may just be due to my lack of play time with the skill and build style as I've mostly been playing melee builds. So, take that with a grain of salt.   -[u] Lag and Loading: [/u] Right now Wolcen seems to be pretty CPU intensive, generally once in-game it isn't too bad, but sometimes when starting a run or going to the next level it takes too long and some monsters show up and slowly start beating on me to the point I end dying at the start.  -[u] Bugs: [/u] It is early access, there are bug. My review is very long now so go look in the forums for the bugs.   [h1] Future Content: [/h1]  For this I would really suggest going to their website ([url=store.steampowered.com] https://wolcengame.com/ [/url] to see what they have planned as I have gone on quite a bit so far and I would just be copy-pasta-ing everything anyway.  If you like Hack and Slash ARPGs the likes of Diablo, you can find enjoyment here. I'd recommend picking it up if it goes on sale before release (January 2020 if they are still on track!), if it doesn't then maybe just wait until it is released if you don't feel like being limited to lvl 20 (lvl 90 is the cap on release).  Current state, I give this early access version a 7/10. Again, I'm giving this a 7/10 as an early access game. I'm not giving a fully developed and launched game a 7/10 because that is not what that is...sometimes people seriously forget that when reviewing or reading reviews of early access games. I hope to update this on release, and I hope I can give the fully released version of Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem a 7/10 or better!  Thank you for your time, Flyhumpy"
123608486,english,0,424370,"2,5 years after release and still no minute gameplay without multiple bugs. feels even more bugged then at release. to just name a few in online solo and online group play:  - npcs blocking the way in campain, no progress possible (sometimes aether jump can help) - random game crashes - random party/group crashes - clicking in UI windows will move you character to the location behind (as if there would be no UI window) -> especially fun when you want to trade and move away instead -> this bug is present since release! - mouse wheel often not working to scroll down at vendor lists - cutscenes not loading - sometimes loading times up to a minute for new campain areas - tooltips closing when another party member changes his gear (wtf) - invisible items in inventory (several restarts needed to fix this) - items cannot be equiped in any gear slot (several restarts needed to fix this) - items sometimes drop without names - new party members stuck on town portal - enemys getting stuck on corners - stash often not usable at all (yes seems to be known since over a week) - wrong tooltip damage (e.g. minion tooltip dps scaling with wrong dmg types) - graphical bugs (black boxes over enemies) - enemies glitching through the map - quest markers randomly disappering - sometimes equipment disapears after logout - sound bugs with overlaying never ending sounds   and there are still many annoying game mechanics - left mouse will always move/attack (nothing else can be bind to left mouse) - character does not move straight to target locations, it always try to find a path to that location - you have to choose/select a reward even if there is just 1 item you get - npc companions blocks your range attacks - loot disappears a second after drop and connot be picked up automatically - u have pets, but they are useless - u can transform into a huge cool looking beeing, that does no dmg but hase some great fx - boring skill runes (16 runes per skill and a lot of them are just + %dmg) - bad ai of summons and the most of them can not be given commands  pros: - has some nice visual effects - some fx/explosions have some satisfying sound too - rage and willpower system and not simply mana - passive tree is not to simple and not to complex - easy/cheap to respec -> you can start playing without searching/creating a build before in a third party programm - you can loot, lvl up, gear up, craft, ""play"" with friends - some bugs can be fun too  sadly it is still more frustrating then fun to play"
168131604,english,0,424370,I understand abandoning a project. But not allowing your players to enjoy multiplayer? Peer to Peer or releasing a server API. Instead just nothing. Big lol.
172377285,english,1,424370,"I have a little history with Wolcen ,i tried it a few years ago and my computer had some problems,here on steam this is my second experience with this game.   Unfortunately my review comes at a time when developpers announced their plan to end the support for multiplayer and endgame content however there's enough content in the single player campaign and to be honest i was interested only in that. The after grind is not for me and there are better alternatives for that.  If you never heard of this game there are similar games like Path of Exiles or Diablo series,this can be a great choice if you're interested in action rpgs with dungeon crawling and loot-based progression.  I really liked the dark fantasy theme and visually the game is a feast for the eyes and for my surprise the voice acting was great for this kind of game. After some browsing i discovered popular voice actors from games i played before like dragon age or witcher 3.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311461899  In terms of gameplay everything was smooth with no major issues or bugs.. the movement was fluid and the dodge/roll responsive. With a huge arsenal of spells and combinations of talent trees you can create a unique character, featuring a classless system Wolcen doesn't lock you into a specific class !   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311376207  Another mechanic i enjoyed was the Apocalyptic Form, this transforms you into avatars with unique and powerful abilities ,there are multiple avatars you can unlock each with its own theme. Beyond the cool factor and amazing visuals there are strategic advantages during though battles or boss fights.  At this point in time i can only recommend this if you're looking for the single player content, for a great price during a sale of course.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311467285  Pros: - Great story with twists and betrayals - Voice acting  - Visuals  Cons: - If you want more than single player campaign,read the negative reviews  My review score  Story - 9 Gameplay- 8  Graphics- 8 Sound - 9  Overall - 8.5"
63504300,english,0,424370,"Right now the game just feels unpolished and I cant tell if its because of the servers being under strain and things feel laggy or its just the way the game is but combat often feels unresponsive and choppy, attacks dont connect the way you expect them to not to mention the unit collision can make things super frustrating at times.   There is also a problem of skills not giving you enough information about what they actually do and how they scale and all the information given is usually very vague such as ""increases damage dealt by summons"" but it doesnt give you a number and from what I can tell you cant see it in the stats of the summons either. Status ailments are also hard to keep track of since there is no indicator on an enemy telling you what they are afflicted by and how many stacks youve put on them and similar things happen all over the game with things being very obscured and unclear for no real reason.  Last of all is just a personal complaint since I am going for a summoner build but the AI for the summons is ridiculously bad 70% of the time they just sit behind me and do nothing, the charge command for the zombie summons rarely ever work they either get stuck on you, each other, the terrain or on thin air. there is also nothing in the game that tells you if your summons scale of things like youre status ailment chance or if they calculate their own stats separately from yours. You also completely lack any form of indicator of how many summons you currently have so you have to manually keep track of them at all times which feels like a huge step backwards from every other ARPG ive played.   TLDR: I do enjoy the build diversity and experimentation the game offers you but I can not recommend it as it is now because the unresponsive and unreliable combat system holds it back.  Edit: There are alot of really butthurt people commenting on this review deciding to ignore the fact that the game is getting more and more negative reviews by the hour and that the game is not flawless and that alot of the problems are personal opinion and thoughts. Neither am I attacking or discrediting the devs in any way and I know they are working to improve the game but that doesnt mean i will recommend the game until these issues are addressed."
65543844,english,0,424370,"Update: I have re-downloaded the game as of August 7th ([u]after 5 months[/u]) and here are some of the things i noticed.  [b]Bugs, bugs, and more bugs.[/b]  I started a new character to see what has changed.... 1. The server capacity is only at 1k now, so anytime it goes over the limit, the server will shut down.(yes wolcen lost 98% of the player base, so they downgraded their servers to the limit before release.) This is what happens with a bad launch, or releasing a game that was not ready. When will gaming companies learn? First impressions matter and you can't redeem yourself after a bad launch. 2. As i played through the beginning of act one again, there was an audio bug of squishy corpse noises that wouldn't stop playing and it was annoying as hell to the point where i had to go to settings and turn the effects volume off. 3. Things disappeared in the chests. 4. Offline character randomly deleted. 5. I still sometimes get stuck in objects, but not as often as i did before. 6. Playing as a ranged character, the hit boxes are still janky or sometimes it doesn't register. 7. I got stuck in a loading screen for 10 minutes after ACT 1 transitioning to ACT 2. 8. There is still some latency issues here and there, but it definitely was not as bad as before. 9. I wasn't able to test online because i couldn't find anyone online to play with... everyones gone, what do you expect. But last i played the LAG was BAD. 10. While going through act one, sometimes the quests don't register and i got stuck in a map and had to go through the other maps again for the quests to register correctly.  WILL UPDATE AS I PROGRESS FURTHER OR FIND NEW PROBLEMS.  [b]SKILLS AND BALANCE[/b]   Will update when i'm higher level.   [b]Armor and Weapons[/b]  1. Legendaries are still useless... 2. Seems as if armor doesn't make as much of an impact as your passive skill tree.  Will update more as i progress.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This game lost 127k players within the first month of release. That should tell you how terrible the developers are at making decisions. They make decisions to satisfy them and not the player base. They do not listen to feedback and usually deletes them.  If you even look closer, the people who have the top reviews didn't continue playing after they reviewed. Because after the game released, the first patch destroyed the game, the second patch nerfed skills and took ALL players hard earned money away whether you were a cheater or not, (because they couldn't catch who did or did not cheat), which caused mass amount of players to quit since they lost their hours upon hours of grinded money.   The last time i played wolcen was a few weeks ago, ever since they've completely nerfed everything, and haven't balanced the skills, the game has become unplayable. They'll keep nerfing skills people find a good build on to help clear the maps faster.  The game itself was already very grindy if you didn't cheat, but now they've nerfed all skills and made the required materials to upgrade items 2 - 4 times more is just ridiculous.   I just wanted a game where i could enjoy hack and slashing mindlessly and enjoy the loot drops, but rare loot drops are almost non-existent at this point because of the nerfing.   If diablo lets players 1 hit everything and clear through the map fast and enjoy their way of grinding, why can't the developers of Wolcen do it? The answer is, they don't want players to have fun.   The result: they've lost 95% of the player base as of today. You will not find anyone to be able to play with because majority of the people has quit. Personally, I'm not going to go back and waste my time on the game anymore till a year later when they've finally fixed the game.   Wolcen studio, here's an advice: to keep your player base, LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR WISHES. Don't DELETE US AND BAN US FROM DISCORD BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE OUR SUGGESTIONS.  I wouldn't be surprised if their servers are not up anymore in a month or two. Wolcen studio has destroyed themselves and the player base. Do not support them and give them your money. Who ever is making all the decisions in this game should be fucking fired."
70830944,english,0,424370,"Great looking game, great feeling game.  The issue I had is that the game provides you barely any numbers for your spells and abilities.  Descriptions such as ""Your attacks may cause lightning to chain foes""  No proc chance, no damage number for the lightning, just fucking guess.  So I thought, you know what they got a great game here, fun to play, they just gotta fill in some blanks.  Was I dead wrong!!! They are making an expansion!?!?!?!  They didn't even give you fucking spell descriptions yet, and they have the godamned nerve to make an expansion!?  WTF is wrong with these people.  Pro tip, some player love to know what their characters abilities do, we don't need act 4 to this mess, just fix your game please!!!!"
97110792,english,0,424370,"TLDR: Wolcen at this current point in time is still half baked. They have made good progress since launch, but it still has a very long way to go. As of right now, endgame is bugged and the story is not finished yet, and due to this i cannot recommend this game. THIS DOES NOT MEAN, I WANT THE DEVS TO GIVE UP.  I want to love this game. The foundations that the devs have laid are quite solid. Skills are fun to use, changing builds is super easy, the transmog system and dye system is super easy and you can always keep yourself looking good, and the endgame systems they have set up promise a good time.   Thats the problem though, the games foundations are solid, and the ideas are good, but there are too many bugs and issues holding the game back. During my play through (most of which was done co-op with a friend), we experienced a couple of bugs through the story, one of which forced us to replay an entire section (thankfully an earlier section) because his character did not get the completion flag to trigger on his account.  Another bug we encountered that was VERY annoying, was in chapter 3. we were experiencing a really weird bug where our characters and animations were all moving/playing in full speed, but it was as if our characters were getting stuck in the floor and the game was having a hard time trying to figure out where we were, thus forcing us to move in super slow motion, EVEN WHEN NO ENEMIES COULD POSSIBLY BE DEBUFFING US.  Then we have the issues with endgame, currently there is a huge bug where if you are in a mandate OR expedition, sometimes when you open your inventory, skill screen, or passive screen, it boots you out of the mandate/expedition completely and kills the portal, completely resetting your progress. It is completely random WHICH screen does it when it decides to happen, but it happens frequently enough that i have only been able to complete 3 mandates and 2 expeditions.  I have also encountered bugs in expeditions that render the boss immune to all sources of damage, hits simply not registering at all. I know this is a bug, as the boss was not IN a damage immune phase. no numbers were even popping up, yet their model was flashing as though it was getting hit and my internet connection was perfectly fine. (on top of that, i was able to fully recreate the issue in offline mode where internet is a non-issue)  Then we have the story. The story just started to get interesting in chapter 3, annnnnd it ends on a cliffhanger.   Due to all of the issues stated above, i cannot recommend this game to anyone quite yet. I ABSOLUTELY DO ACKNOWLEDGE that the dev team has made progress, good progress, but its not done yet, and i do hope that they continue to improve upon, and expand what they have.  I want this game to succeed, as stated in the beginning, i love all of the ideas they have, its just not ready yet."
67819670,english,0,424370,"I have spent 465 hours on game and I feel like I am in position to let you know if you should buy it or not.  Short answer - Do not buy it!  The lack of communication from these developers is outstanding. We dont know the roadmaps, nor what is being fixed or worked on. They seem to neglect priority of fixing servers completely which are very broken and dsyfunctional for multiplayer experience.  The neglect is very obvious even in their own discord channels which are being polluted by dupers and real $ sellers. And they really dont do anything about it. (And on funny note after helping and twitching for their community they banned me without a reason).  The dupping in wolcen is disaster. To this day nothing has been done. But can you blame dupers not really... The whole crafting system as one friend put it to me, is worse then winning a national lottery. Without dupers selling gears you would never be able to craft perfect or close to perfect gears. The whole crafting system is one massive joke.  The game is alpha state there is very little content to do apart of experimenting with builds and griding level 90. In order to reach level 90 you would need to spend around a year in game, its worse then grinding in MMO.  I could go on but just take a look at bug reporting section or jump on discords and you will see how the game has failed the community and declining very fast.  The only good thing was the story and single player experience till you finish it but its not worth the price they ask, nor your time. Just wait for diablo. These guys made something unique but they executed on it poorly. They dont know how to manage community nor they know how to run servers."
186158338,english,0,424370,Developer couldn't complete this game and abandoned it. Just becasue they released it and called it 1.0 doesnt at all mean it was. Then very shortly after announce another arpg. Took customers money and threw them away. Don't fall for it again.
32153912,english,1,424370,"So....I had originally given this game a poor review but after sinking some more time into it I have begun to really really be excited about it.   Realize that if you get the game now there isnt too much content. That is the one thing I would want to impress on anyone thinking of getting the game now. It is still early access.  ~~~AS OF NOW~~~ ~~~~~THE GOOD~~~~~ I am in love with the skill set of a few of the characters. The POE-like style of the skill tree is fantastic...but unlike POE you dont have to follow a straight line with it. There are very few restrictions in terms of where you can go. Keeping in mind that there are only half of the tree available at this point and a lvl 20 cap I am pretty hyped about what else I can do in the game.  The skill graphics are dazzling. I dont use that word very often but I will in this case. I am really enjoying the way it is all put together and having a ton of fun grinding already.   It seems to be getting updated and patched regularly.   I really think this will give POE and D3 a run for their money and Im happy I found it early on to see how it gets develped over time.   ~~~~~THE NOT SO GOOD~~~~~ Content. I really wish there was more to do in the game. Ive been grinding away at capped level hunting for really mediocre gear (the usual progression of white gear, blue gear, yellow gear) and it seems that yellow gear is as high as its gotten. I suppose this isnt as much a complaint as it is a desire for more.  Bugs. The game crashes for me occasionally and has quite a few random movement bugs. It is a little clunky in a few ways but again...it is early access and is to be somewhat expected at this stage.  ~~~~~IN THE END~~~~~ Would I recommend you get this. Yes. I would not expect a very polished game though. If you want to get into a great game early and see it all come together over time...this is it.  I am really excited to see what becomes of this game and look forward to some sleepless nights~"
63701725,english,0,424370,"passive nodes that don't work, passive nodes that are overtuned, stashes and characters disappearing, and all the server downtime, but what are the devs' top priority?  Banning everyone who duped gold using a bug that was reported YEARS ago.  The attributes nerf coming out of the claimed ""beta"", cause let's face it this game is still in beta, is just one of the many unbelievable things this release botched. Defensives removed, leveling makes you weaker, and adding attributes tops off what you are focusing on (crit, att speed< ailment chance or hp/shield), but weakens the rest? What?  Apparently game is as playable as it was 4-5 years ago, and they spent this time transferring it to another engine and rewriting some code so it fit the engine, and no progress was made in making the game actually work. Then again, this sounds so absurd so do your own research about this if it makes or breaks your purchase.  The game looks fun and plays quite well at the starting stages and despite alot of build whining online you can make any build work all the way to the end of the campaign, because killing bosses is really learning their mechanics more than a dps race  before the reality kicks in that your build is worthless in endgame (yes i played lightning mage and later found out more than half my nodes, mostly the spell damage ones, do not work)  Oh, and did i mention that certain endgame mechanics (i.e the Dark Market) bricks your game?   Story is what you would expect out of an ARPG, something demons/devils, something angels, character is blessed/cursed and is called to action etc etc.  You will have fun for the first few hours, in awe of the graphics and the unique rotating skill tree. If you are willing to spend the game's full price (34 SGD for me) for ""a few hours of fun"", then go for it.   Otherwise, dont even look at this game. I heard Grim Dawn is on sale."
73283758,english,0,424370,"I've Been Tricked, I've Been Backstabbed and I've Been Quite Possibly, Bamboozled!  C'mon WOLCEN Studios, it's 2020, man. You guys know better than to do this to us. We're so hungry for a good ARPG, and to not be able to make this pre-beta game actually full release quality after 5 months post-launch, and AFTER you've already taken our money is an absolute disgrace. ""But we're working hard to fix the bugs!"", yeah, we get it. But that's what closed alpha/ beta tests are for, to get the bugs worked out...instead, we unwittingly paid you a whopping $39.99 to beta test your game. Launches like this, and dodgy attempts at quelling the outrage with empty promises of patches and content really make me miss the good old days of buying a physical game at a store. It was a tangible summation of painstaking hours of coding and testing that was crisp, clean, and very rarely had game-breaking bugs. Developers tested the hell out of their product to deliver something to the gaming population that they were proud of. WOLCEN Studios, what do you have to be proud of with this game?"
64627880,english,0,424370,"So 200+ hours into the game, and  to be honest I hate writing reviews, but I can't keep my frustration at bay any longer. It has all been said before. The game is utterly broken with all the bugs. Some of the bugs I don't mind but for me the crazy frustration are things like backtracking through an entire map just to kill the last rat and then go ALL the way through the entire map to kill the boss. Not a bug, just an insanely hair ripping experience. Did they fix the life regeneration of bosses in 1.08. NO they didn't, welcome to another boss that instantly heal destroying the run. Most of the time when you get one shotted you will have no idea where it comes from, and it will happen often on higher levels unless you are crazy geared, or using some broken skills/exploits. The game is not optimized for dodging and many times you have no chance to avoid the attacks, dying while you panic press the button that suppose to save you. I play offline on a very good gaming rig and yet I die over and over again to retarded programming, it is beyond frustrating. Planning to do a lot of crafting, well not in Wolcen. The crafting materials are the most uncommon items in the game, and even with help from the marked you will chew through your very small stack of materials in mere seconds most likely not getting what you want. I do love the game, because it could have been so good, and yet they choose to put a beta on the marked most likely due to financial reasons, and yes it was a smart decision money wise, because people were hungry for a new hack & slash and bought the unfinished product but it could have been so much better. On one side I hope they will get it all fixed in time, but on the other side I also hope they take the money and retire so I can uninstall this @#@# from my hard drive, especially since I don't have any hair left."
142638044,english,1,424370,"Thoroughly enjoyed this. I was playing this concurrently with Diablo 4 and found myself playing this more. I played as a sorcerer in offline mode and nothing felt like a grind as it does in D4. Combat is fun and the spells have decent variety. I had the most fun with 3 summons and an OP annihilation beam.   You can pause the game unlike D4, which is super handy as i have a toddler running around and i can simply resume where i was without getting killed or logged off. All in all i am satisfied and will replay this. It was an absolute steal for only 10 dollars.  in comparison I paid 150$ for D4 ultimate edition and am mostly disappointed, i should have just watched the cut scenes online and called it a day."

45904456,english,1,424370,"As you may have noticed, this is a very polarizing game. By buying it, you have access to an early version of the game. You want an full-fledged experience right at this moment? Then don't buy it now. You want to support a possibly great game and provide feedback? Then go for it. The devs have taken the risky steps to recreate almost entirely the underlying systems that define the game (every dev dreams of this) and from what I have seen during the (short, technical) beta, it paid out. The game looks sharper, the gameplay way more responsive and this is a very good base to build content on.  Now do I recommend this game? This is clearly too soon to say. Diablo 3 was looking pretty good during beta and see where it is now. There are many game design choices that can kill a game beyond just core gameplay. We have no idea how loot or build dynamics will play out in the endgame, or the amount of content we'll have. And we will probably not know until late in beta or after release.  I'm leaving a positive review (for now) and I urge you to ignore trolls who still don't undertand what Early Access is meant to be. Now to WOLCEN Studio, don't disappoint ;)"
75628623,english,0,424370,"As a primarily ARPG player coming from Grim Dawn and Diablo 3 , I will try to review this game on it's ARPG parameters equivalent.  Graphics : Hand's down the best in any ARPG. Graphics are extremely beautiful. Locations are varied but very linear, similar to Diablo 3.  Core Gameplay : Now , the skills we use in this game are similar to Orbs from Path of Exile (POE) , called Enneracts in this game. This skills have their own modifiers when you level up however some of the modifiers are pretty bland and boring.  Modifiers such as ""Increased damage"" or ""Increased critical hit chance"" adds no variety at all. Such modifiers should come with unique weapons rather than an modifier upgrade itself. Right now the meta is ailment stacking and almost everyone runs this play style for maximum damage.  UI : UI is pretty standard ; however translation and description of skills could be better. It is extremely confusing to know which skill scales with either attack or casting speed.  Combat : Fast and engaging , stylish and satisfying.  Character building and development :  There are no fixed classes so you can play a hybrid of pretty much anything ; This is detrimental to the long term success of the game BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS DEEP AS PATH OF EXILE. There is really no variety in class building / theorycrafting in this game. Veteran ARPG players likes to spend an hour or so to theory craft their builds but this is not possible. Also, if you intend on playing a summoner build , hold off for now because SUMMONS DO NOT SCALE WITH ANY IN-GAME PLAYER GEAR ; there is only 1 unique item which increases their damage and that's about it. The Gates of Fate ( Similar to Path of Exile's Skill Tree) is not expansive enough. Re-spec in this game is really , really cheap so I don't see a point in starting another character.  Storyline : It's the best in any ARPG and the cinematics are top-notch.  Itemization : Itemization is good but can be better, There are no set items in this game. It is pretty much a tried tested and proven Diablo 3 where you insert various gems in your weapon and armor slots. You can however re-roll the type of sockets and rolls on your items with certain end-game materials.  End-game : Copy and pasted from Diablo 3 rift dungeons. , At the end of the dungeon , you get loot and that's about it. Atleast in Diablo 3, you get to upgrade your gems but there isn't any legendary gem socketing in this game. You unlock the ""Champion of Stormfall mode"" , where you send out mercenaries to do missions and the only way to complete the timer is for you to do dungeon runs. So it becomes an insane , insane dungeon farming loop and it's similar to Diablo 3 , POE and Grim Dawn.   Bugs : I did ran into gamebreaking bugs that needed me to restart this game ; this is totally unacceptable as this game has been out for 6 months or so. Bugs included : Unable to move on to the next location and not able to teleport back to town. I experienced one game crash.   Final verdict : 5/10 , get it on sale or discount. This game will be at it's best in another year or so. There is a huge issue within the community regarding some of the features advertised during it's early access and was not implemented during release , and when you consider this game has been in early access for FIVE YEARS , they should have done better. It's a cash and grab in my honest opinion. Wolcen has a long , long way to go if they want to challenge Grim Dawn , POE , Diablo 3 , Torchlight 2 and even Last Epoch. You're better off spending money on Chronicon / Grim Dawn if you love ARPG's."
95337898,english,0,424370,"Imagine ordering a pizza from a new place. Some time later a  manager calls you and tells you, that a pizza will be delivered a bit later, as they are overworked. No problem, you guess, things happen. So you wait. Finally, delivery guy comes with your order. The pizza box looks kinda nice from the ourside, exept for a few small dents.  Then, you open the box, and inside of it you find a [i]doughy, slimy thing of a roughly circular shape[/i].

101719096,english,1,424370,"I avoided this game up until a few weeks ago (when it went on one of its sales) because of the mixed reviews. I was craving an arpg, but felt like I played most of those that I wanted. I noticed the the reviews were still mixed but going up since the release and looked into it more as the devs seemed to be still active and trying to turn the game around. I decided to take the leap, and honestly, I'm glad I did. Although this is definitely not the best arpg I've played, I had a good time playing through the story and currently doing a little end game content. That being said there are definitely some criticisms, but it does appear that the devs are keen on fixing most of the issues I have in future patches. Even with only having a fun time going through the story, I played around 30-40 hours, which alone was good enough to justify the 20 something dollars I paid, although maybe not full price. Here are the list of positives and negatives for me:  Positives: -Best graphics in an arpg so far -Combat is satisfying and and fun -Story I thought was pretty good and kept me interested (people are mad about the ending, but I don't mind the cliff-hanger knowing they plan on adding it later especially when I got a lot out of what was already there) -I like the passive talent trees -I also like that you can customize each skill to fit different builds  Negative: -I wish there were more skills available. I was a little disappointed with the limited selection despite how customizable they are. A part of me was also disappointed that you can basically get all the active skills you will use for the rest of the game really early, as you can just buy them. -Uninteresting gear. I've had a few legendary and unique pieces of armor and weapons so far, but none of them were really that interesting, just better stats than the other gear, with sometimes a small twist on something with the unique armor. I would really like to see this area fleshed out more in future patches. -Although I'm enjoying the end game so far, I can definitely see it getting stale in the near future (particularly with no really interesting gear to ""switch things up"").  Neutral: -I know another gripe of people were glitches in the game. I know this will vary between systems, but I had only 3 glitches that I noticed, one of which was a crash. The other two were minor. It seems like they did a great job cleaning them up, at least from my experience. -Kind of mixed on having the skills completely determined by the weapon. I wanted to make a pally type character only to realize I couldn't use some of the skills I wanted to do (although I did google and find out there is one shield that allows spells with a shield, but it still kind of bugged me). I also had a rogue character that I feel would be perfect with 1 or 2 of the spells, but can't unless I don't duel wield daggers (have to do one dagger with a catalyst in the other hand), which makes it feel like it isn't the rogue anymore.  -No Act 4. Currently, the story leaves you on a cliff-hanger as I mentioned. I don't find it necessarily a bad thing as I it makes me want to stick around to see what happens. That being said I understand people's point that it is a full game and it should have already been in it.  Overall, it was definitely worth the price I paid ($24 I think) (on the fence at full price). It has its issues, but the devs seem active and I hope they truly make this into an even better game."
91562161,english,1,424370,"So, I managed to beat this thing.  I should probably note my perspective on this is perhaps a little unusual, because I NEVER knew of the kickstarter. All I knew going in was the game had a rough launch, but had been getting patches and updates, until I saw it on sale sometime after Bloodtrail came out and though ""Hey, why not?"" So a lot of the controversy around this game I was mostly unaware of.  So coming into this somewhat blind and well after the fact? What's here is not half bad. It's basically Path of Diablo 3, taking clear influences from both games. Like Diablo 3 you've got highly modifiable skills, but a giant passive skill tree like Path of Exile etc.  That said the game manages to put a few of it's own twists on things. The skill tree for example, can have parts of it rotated, Want to use nodes form opposite ends of the tree? No need to use a bunch of skill points to path across, just move the tree a bit so the parts you want are closer together. In fact I'd argue flexibility in character building is this game's greatest strength. most passive skills in this game cover broad categories, think ""any elemental damage"" or ""any physical damage"" rather than ""fireball"" or ""swords"" so for whatever build you've got going, there's probably a few different skills that will work with it, and since skills learn abilities that change their damage type, skills that generally wouldn't fit a build can be MADE to do so. Elemental affliction on a melee fighter? Sure, why not?  The biggest drawbacks I can think of, controversy aside, is the game is short. I beat it in about 15 hours, I was skipping most of the little side dungeons, but really there's not much in the way of side content here. There is an endgame called Champion of Stormfall which looks decently involved, though I haven't dabbled in it much as of this writing.  While the game has a reputation for bugs, I haven't really encountered many in my playthrough. mostly it was texture pop in and maybe some animation issues early on, odd, but nothing show-stopping. The devs HAVE been patching since launch, though people keep saying it's buggy, so I'm not sure if those reviews are simply outdated or if this is a ""it works on my PC""(tm) thing.  Finally i'll note for better or worse this game is VERY edgelord in presentation. It looks like the devs played some Warhammer, saw everyone's massive shoulders and said ""here, hold my beer."" whether that's annoying, awesome or both is up to individual preference.  So... yeah, overall, not bad! I maybe wouldn't say to rush and buy it now because this thing had a rough history and there's plenty of solid looter-rpgs out there without that hanging over its head. but if you don't care about that or are feeling curious? By all means give it a shot, you might be surprised."
131164238,english,0,424370,"Because of the new update I decided to give the game another chance. Turns out it remains incredibly frustrating and I really can't recommend the game to anyone.  First of all, the game lags throughout. Even with a very low ping this is very noticeable. It takes up to five seconds between clicking on the merchant and opening the menu. With a ping of 30.  The lag is also clearly noticeable in combat, especially when using a healing potion. In the HUD, you can clearly see how the empty life bar is filled, then falls back to its original state for a fraction of a second, only to be filled again. It's so much fun when a fatal hit kills you thanks to this lag.  Speaking of death, once you die, you have three respawns. Resurrecting is only allowed for a short period of time and the game always respawns you at your corpse. Once you revive, you are immediately vulnerable to damage again. This can (and will!) lead to you being revived in a poisonous cloud and dying again immediately.  The game has no animation cancelling. Short explanation what animation cancelling means: If you are in an animation (e.g. casting a spell), but then suddenly want to dodge an attack, the spell is canceled and the character dodges. This function does not exist in the game. Meaning  that every animation, no matter how small and unimportant, is played to the end before a new input by the player is accepted. There are constantly situations in battles where the game tells you that you should dodge an attack, but you can't because you're already casting a spell or your character has to finish his walking animation first.  In the end, the game feels extremely laggy and unresponsive.  After almost three years we finally have the last chapter of the story (lol). Of course, at this point I have no idea what it was about and just skipped through the dialogs. I just dont care anymore. So i cant review the story But looks visually nice, like the rest of the game.  The gameplay of the last chapter, however, I can review. And it is a disaster. There is hardly any pure story gameplay compared to the other chapters. Instead, the mechanics of the previous endgame have been reworked to stretch out the gameplay of the last chapter as long as possible. Instead of going from area to area like in the previous chapters (and all other diablo likes games). You now have to research the next story mission on a map. To advance this research you now have to empty random dungeons. Basically the research of new Missions take for example 3  turns, and one dungeons is a turn.  You can accelerate the research and unlock other buffs by other researches, but these also take turns. This was the old endgame and it is obvious this was reworked to rush out the story chapter. If you have finally researched the final boss, you can now research debuffs for the boss. These are enormously expensive (gold and other resources) and are done by the same research mechanic. So you invest a lot of gold and time to weaken the boss, run dungeons, get better gear and try to enjoy the gameplay. But there are two huge problems:  1) At some point, the game forces you to start the fight. You have no other choice. Several battles with different tasks follow. And hopefully you knew exactly which debuffs you were researching. Because: 2) If you die in this battle (because you weakened the wrong attack or a buggy mechanic killed you), all your progress is gone. All buffs and debuffs are deactivated, your gold is gone of course and you are back to square one. Now you have to waste a ton of time again, have to spend hundredthousands of gold again and hope you get him the next time.  Yeah it could be cool rogue lite feature, if the gameplay would be fun. But sadly it isnt. Its frustrating. I gave this game many chances. But the gameplay issues since day one, the chapter 4 mechanic that just an insult and Diablo IV and Path of Exile on the horizon i dont think i will every enjoy this game.  And i didnt even mention the bugs (and there are so many!), the boring gear system, the uninspred skills and the pseudo deep character progression."
60421532,english,1,424370,"Played for more than 12 hours, unlike some others. I have only purchased the game in the last 3 days so I haven't gone through the massive wait also like some others who would be salty about that now. Just like Diablo there is a very toxic community who seem to 'dog' the game and spoil things for others. Maybe that's just the hack n slash community.  Whats awesome, ie what I wish other games had including Diablo that I spent 1000's of hours playing: -Hypnotic wheat animation, I've already spent moments running around in it just for relaxation purposes. -Music that reminds me of Baulders Gate, that I also spent 1000's of hours playing -Leveling like I've never seen before. Some aspects are familiar but then something different. -Skills are just found and can be learnt by any class. -Tumble for everyone. -Voice for all. No more reading. AND did I hear Minsc (Jim Cummings)? I hope I did. -Random Treasure chest spawn locations. Can;t guess where they will be at the moment. So gotta look around. -No limitation on who can wear the armour you find. -STEAM PUNK theme. Love that, time to move forward in time. Why don't sequels do that? start why back when and move forward after a few releases. -Some old familiar mechanics but also some new. about 50/50. Now I am interested but not completely lost. -Loving the varied weapon sound effects. I can it the same thing a few times and get different sounds from my sword.  Now those complaining about the time for release. Kinda reminds me of waiting for Diablo 4 or Linage. This team is a lot smaller. Remember when Diablo 3 came out. People said it was coonie/goonar rubbish but it got patched and patched and worked on. Just like assetto corsa when it came out as well. Patience is key these days. No games come out like Baulders Gate these days that are awesome on release. Makes me thing that waiting 2 years after the release is better when I think about it. Release is more like early access these days.  I hope this review is ok with mentions of other games."
39909780,english,0,424370,"* A year later.... + some, They finally shiped a update ""the new junk"". Gave it 1hr and will unfollow this crap.   ___________________________________________________________ I love the genre and see tons of potential in this, but for now there is way too little content to recommend it.  I know its alpha but almost two years in early access you should be able to show a bit more content. 20hrs in I got 3 level 20 chars with good gear and basically just farm for nothing.  My concern is that it been in alpha since 2015 and first ETA said it would go beta in 2016 (from Kickstarter). Even then they stated four years of preperation and all the storyline etc was done.  Open to change the review once I feel that I can recommend the game to others but for now just add it on your follow list."
105779535,english,1,424370,"cool game. visually amazing, worth it if you like games like diablo or path of exile.  Just beware that you have to play this game in offline mode otherwise its pretty much unplayable due to only 25% of your attacks actually hitting and lag walking all over the place, this will probably never be fixed either.  Your progress is also wiped when you switch to offline mode.  So if your reading this it might be best to put it in offline mode right away when you start."
71380132,english,1,424370,"I am torn with rating this game. Its has huge potential but also some severe problems.  Pros: - huge skill tree (you can develop your character just any way you feel like) - Interesting feature to build up your ""city"" to support and aid your hero - awesome graphics (including battle animations)  Cons: - laking endgame content (especially loot: no sets and highest tier items are the worst in game) - not very engaging team of developers (they like to nerf skills and create the most useless unique items possible showing that they dont understand their own game in that respect) - due to the afore-mentioned there is a severe limit on character development possibilities (yes you can chose any skills you like but in actual fact only very few builds really work well)  I will give this a thumb up simply because I hope that the developers will eventually create meaningful set items and fix many of the useless skills.  Dont buy this game yet. Put it on your wishlist and wait for the problems to be solved (and a sale) !"
63860641,english,0,424370,"After playing Wolcen for nearly 50 hours, reaching level 70 and Expedition level 103, I feel that I can finally share my opinion on this game with others.  Wolcen is a beautiful game full of potential, but ultimately unpolished in it's gameplay elements with very little to no originality. it isn't to say no effort was put in this game, but these efforts weren't put where it mattered the most.  Let's begin with the good stuff:  Visuals:  The graphics and environnements are gorgeous. The ship graveyard in the intro is simply amazing. The Spells and Skill visual effects are also very good. The character model are quite decent and the transmog (fashion) system is quite simply what games these days treat as standard. Finally, the enemy models are clear and a quick glance will let you know what you are up against. Zones are also distinct from one another.  Audio:  The audio is good. The music is good while it isn't memorable. The voice acting is solid for the most part. Finally, the sound effects of weapons/skills/spells sound impactful. The gear drop as various cue for different rarity and items type and it is quite clear what drops on the ground based on sound only.   Boss Fight (during the story) :  While heavily inspired by Diablo 3 upon release, the boss fight are multi phased encounters with various mechanics, patterns and overlaps to master. You will most likely die and struggle at some point or another on your first run through each of them. Ressource management is key and mechanic anticipation essential. I had a good vibe of the Inferno d3 level of difficulty (minus the enrage mechanics on all boss) and that was perhaps the best thing d3 did on release.  and now, for the not so good:  Gameplay:  While the gameplay in a Arpg isn't necessarely very deep, in Wolcen it is straight up braindead (outside the boss fight which represent 1% of the game). You spam a main skill and plow through mass of enemies without a second thought. you dodge from time to time and that's about it. Base skill cast speed is ludicrously slow and it is painful to cast a buff that last 5 second and look at a 2 second animation that stop your movement dead in it's track.  While skills are visually nice, very few ends up being fun to use along side one another. you to use 1 of 3 types of skills. A range weapon/dagger allow for rogue skills, a melee weapon allow for melee skills and a staff/catalyst for spells. No real class, no real skill mixing, that's pretty much it. You play what your weapon gives you. Enemies don't get smarter and are basically scaling hp/dmg sponges.  ARPG Grind Loop:  This one is perhaps my biggest dissapointement with this game. There are no meaningful, build defining items in this game. Quite simply all items do, is buff certain stats. The end. You would think unique items (which seemed very interesting at first) would have an impact on build, since they allow sometime the use of other class skills, but no. They don't scale past level 40 (campaign ends at level 40 ish). They are so rare while leveling that you will never use them. you use rare items and the ''legendary'' (rare with 1 or 2 extra stat buff). Max level requirement tops at 60 and the items get stronger (a few extra numbers). They had some good ideas with the end game unlocks, where you unlock feature by starting projects and completing them by playing. Sadly, it doesn't equate to much more than a few features unlocked which barely improve a meaningless, shallow grind, just a tad better.  Identity:  Now this one is sad. This game, while definitely full of passion, doesn't have a strong identity. It's Diablo 3 mixed with Path of Exile. You get a few good bit of both game, without ever getting very deep in what made those other 2 unique. The gear design is very diablo 3-esque (which is just stupid considering how much better d1 and d2 design is), the skill tree is a less developped PoE version, mainly providing number change rather than gameplay change. There is a ascended form (big immortal high cd low duration form) but it's actually useless and clunky about 99% of the game. it feels like a concept that got abandonned near the end of developpement but left in the game because there was so much time investement in the visual design of the system. Ultimately, Wolcen fails to bring any form of authenticity to the ARPG table, which is severly lacking in my opinion.    I will skip over the many gamebreaking bugs of the few days as I think the dev did a decent job at fixing them while probably being under pressure to meet a deadline release date imposed on them by the publisher. Wolcen was a fun experience for a few hours, but I cannot see myself come back to it any time soon. Unfortunate for a game that was 4 years + in production."
71195108,english,0,424370,"Like everyone's saying, this game's just... meh.  It's not special, it's not interesting, and while it's pretty, it's also buggy as heck.  The game truly lost out on what made it so unique during development too, gradually becoming more and more generic and soulless.  This isn't just seeing the past with rose tinted glasses, as it had problems at every stage of development, but back when I bought this game it really did have an innovative skill system where you could do literally anything you wanted to with mixing and matching your abilities.  Now it just has a few distinct weapon classes that determine what skills you can use and the only way to go out of them is to change your weapon or to be lucky enough to get gear that lets you cast something else, because your skills sure won't let you by default.  More importantly, it's just horrendously balanced, with several skills being pointless, and the story really is just... so default and boring that it's painful.  I know ARPGs don't tend to have the best stories in general, but they could have at least tried to keep some of their initial story's concepts.  I'd avoid it for now, honestly.  The first hours seem to suck in new players, but a lot of people end up feeling a hollow experience in the end."
95060401,english,0,424370,"I've read numerous reviews and some of the more recent reviews stated that a lot of bugs had been fixed. I trusted those reviews and honestly have to say that I am very disappointed in this game.  The Pros:  As I first started playing I was liking Wolcen. The graphics are astounding.  The storyline is engaging and drew me in even further. The implementation of skills are unique and don't lock your character into a single playstyle. The soundtrack is nice and the voice acting is superb.  I thought that since the main aspects of this game were well implemented that this had to be good news and that the developers must have learned from their mistakes and finally fixed their broken game.  The Cons:  Offline characters are separate from online characters. You cannot cross over from offline to online or vice versa. Offline is the only true way to play single player.  If you want to play single player while using an online character then you are forced to flag your game as private.  But nobody plays multiplayer in the first because it is a shit fest of lag and skills not doing damage to NPC's.  There are no side quests. You must follow the storyline. The only semblance of side quests are when you enter a sub-area of the static questline and every time the only goal is to kill all the npc's. These 'side quests' are identical in every zone. Every. Single. Time.  The gold collecting pet gets lost and stuck. Several times I had to backtrack to attempt to get it unstuck. If it did not work than I had to restart the game and I ended up losing all progression through that part of the map and was forced to restart from the previous Town Portal/Waypoint.  The monsters and bosses are mindbogglingly simple. There is no threat of dying and if even you were to come close then you just use a health potion and your life meter is instantaneously refilled. Then the health potions are easily refilled as you kill more NPC's. It's really easy to NOT perish.  As a Summoner my army would sometimes just simply stop attacking NPC's. Fortunately/Unfortunately the game is so embarrassingly simple that I was able to solo each encounter and afterwards my army would return to attacking NPC's again. This bug could prove to be fatal if they game had any semblance of difficulty because there are achievements that you can attain for not dying.  When looking at items in your inventory you hover your mouse over them to see the stats, as is with most every ARPG. Yet more than half time when I would open my inventory hovering over items would do nothing and closing and reopening did not fix the issue. I mean all it ended up taking to fix this issue was  to simply click inside the inventory and the hover function would return to normal. Not game-breaking but still very annoying.  There are invisible walls that blocked my path even though the map showed that these areas should be easily navigated.  I can't imagine how many more bugs I would have encountered If I had decided to continue playing. Each of the bugs on their own merit are not game breaking (except for the Summoners army bugging out) but it is the sheer numbers and frequency of recurrence that killed all mediocre enjoyment I had.  edit: Corrected several spelling mistakes. Game is still garbage."
63474438,english,0,424370,"Don't buy the game yet, way too many bugs as it is. I made it all the way until act 3 before the game decided to reset my character's story progress from the beginning. Kept all the gear/levels, but now I have to grind through the story once again.... Feels bad man, especially since the later areas are super repetitive."
68533935,english,1,424370,"This is one of the harder reviews I have ever had to do. Wolcen is a complete mixed bag of emotions, fun gameplay, lack of polish, and frustrating bugs. It's an ARPG, which means at it's very core, I am probably going to like it.  I'm a well traveled dungeon crawler as my first game was Champions of Norrath on PS2. Sacrilege to those that started with the Diablo series, but I simply missed D2 in it's heyday. My favorite ARPG of all time is Diablo 3 with Path of Exile following closely behind. I have well over 700 hours into Diablo 3 with over 300 hours into Path of Exile (my most played Steam game).  I value exciting, visceral combat above all else. The game being nice to look at doesn't hurt either.  This is why I find myself recommending a game that is honestly, a bit of a mess. Wolcen launched with a shit storm similar to Diablo 3's launch. Nobody could log in and bugs went wild. Full disclosure, I had the game on launch and elected to play offline. At the time of this review I am sitting at 35 or so hours of gameplay. ALL of those hours were offline which saved me a ton of headaches.  Wolcen does a lot of things really well. The game is just flat out gorgeous. I have spent a lot of time in the transmog screen perfecting the look of my character. My character in Wolcen looks 10x better than any character I have ever made. In any game. Particle effects are gorgeous. The environments are destructive and look great. This is the pinnacle of graphics in an ARPG.   The combat is really, really good in Wolcen as well. The game manages to have the weight and fluidity of Diablo 3 without being a complete rip off. Diablo 3 combat is structured around using resource gaining abilities to then use resource spending abilities. Wolcen instead goes for a tug of war resource system where you use willpower abilities to transfer into rage abilities and vice versa. It's fun to play with especially when you start getting gear and passive nodes that speed up those transfer times.  Gear in Wolcen is middle of the pack. It's not the stupidly simply itemization of Diablo 3 where you simply look for green arrows and it isn't the extreme complexity of Path of Exile. I feel like Wolcen strikes a solid balance in the middle ground in itemization...which the game tends to do in general.   Nobody plays an ARPG for it's campaign, but I'm happy to report that Wolcen probably has the best campaign out of modern ARPG offerings. It's fairly well written and the voice acting isn't bad either. It's quick and once it's over, you don't have to deal with it again. You stay in endgame mode much like Diablo 3's ""adventure mode."" Perfect.  So that's all the good. What's the bad?   The endgame is lacking right now. It exists, but it's incredibly repetitive. You blast through what are essentially nephalem rifts from Diablo 3 and build upgrades for the main city which gives you certain bonuses like an extra skill slot or higher magic find stats. That's about it. The maps get boring fairly fast and the developers made the poor decision of having the end of the run boss spawn in a static location. When you fill up the kill meter the boss should spawn on top of you like it does in D3. Instead you have to back tread in the instance that you already passed the boss area or fight through meaningless hordes to get to the boss area. It's sloppily done.  The game is a fairly buggy mess as well. As I already mentioned, I played exclusively offline. Which means I avoided probably 90% of the problems. Players that played online reported stash wipes and even entire characters vanishing. These are the kinds of bugs that would cause me to uninstall the game immediately. Thankfully, they never happened to me. Instead I came across crashes, graphical glitching, campaign missions not properly triggering cut scenes, passive nodes that either do not work as intended...or just don't work at all, and chests in impossible to reach locations.  The game just doesn't feel like it is a complete game. Everything just kind of feels half baked. In the end, you have to ask yourself what you are looking for in an ARPG. If you want a game with hundreds and hundreds of hours...this likely isn't it. After 30 plus hours I just didn't have the drive anymore to do another three expeditions. I ultimately went back to Path of Exile. This seems like a non recommendation, but it isn't. I thoroughly enjoyed my 35 hours in a $35 game (I bought it when it was on early access). It's a game with a pretty solid foundation that needs a lot of repair work and added content. Hopefully the devs don't give up on this game because I think this game could be something special this time next year."
83081451,english,0,424370,"Singleplayer experience first playthrough at launch was ok, and quite fun. Even though many talents were not working and a lack of viable builds. End game was boring. Dropped the game.  Online was riddled with bugs I heard, and the fact that 100,000 plus players dropped the game within weeks says it all.  Came back after Blood Trail. Played an online character, bugged campaign within 30-40 mins, could not progress. How the developer still release broken/buggy content is beyond me. Dropped again.  STILL NOT RECOMMENDED."
129787478,english,1,424370,"I completely gave up on this game back when it released in 2020. It has come a long way and game play is much better and frankly, fun. Give it a second look. There is a lot of fun to be had here,"
65699557,english,0,424370,"ARPG, mix of diablo and Path of Exile I would not recommend this game for 2 reasons: 1) Too many critical bugs 2) It's just a simpler version of PoE If you read this in 1+ years and think they PoE is too complex for you, it might be worth trying Wolcen, but look at the patch notes and be sure they have fixed all the crashing bugs before you buy!  The passive skill tree in Wolcen is a simpler version of PoEs but it is too simple. After figuring it out, there is really only a few choises to make, and the rest is given. The active skills work in a similar was too D3s skill runes system, and (opposite of the passives) this works better than D3! The story is nothing spectacular, but it's not bad ether. Good enough for an ARPG.  It feels like a mix of diablo and path of exile, where diablo have the AAA UI and story, and PoE have the gameplay,  Wolcen have more AAA feel than PoE and more gameplay than diablo (or rather, i expect it will have after a few updates)  Bugs bugs and more bugs: It's another title that looks good on paper, but is about 1 year too early for release. The bugs are many, but the game killer bug is that when you play the endgame content, you have to play 3 dungeon levels in a row, but if the game crashes no progress is saved. This means you can play for 1-2 hours and then the game crashes as you turn in for reward and you have wasted 1-2 hours for nothing. If it wasn't for the gamebreaking bugs, i wouls have recommended this game for all players that like ARPG and thing PoE is too complex.  A good first try, but not good enough :)"
50772177,english,0,424370,"The devs seems to still struggle in figuring what they want to do with their game and also can't seem to focus on one thing at time, which has lead to countless delays and the game being redone from scratch twice since the early access started 3 years ago.  It feels like they don't really know what they're doing at all... instead of focusing in completing the core features of the game, like adding new acts and skills, they go around adding random stuff that is totally pointless to bring at the current state of the game... Who the hell cares for a Housing system or an Arena, when the game is STILL under development, our characters don't even have access to the complete passive skill tree, and our characters will get wiped every now and them??? It's like they can't really decide what they want to do with Wolcen at this point, and I wouldn't be surprised if they simply gave up on this game.  If you're looking for a cool ARPG, then I recommend you to look elsewhere, because this game will take forever to be finished at this pace... if it ever gets finished.  Wolcen: Lords of Delay is a more fitting name for your game.  Update:  I just received a warning from one of the developers saying I was being ""disrespectful"" on a forum post where I shared my feedback and disagreement on preventing you to use spells without equipping spell catalists on your character... I heard people getting their feedback posts getting ""shot down"" by developers, but I thought they were being dramatic or even trolling to piss the devs off... that was until it actually happened to me and I got this warning message saying I was being disrespectful in my post.  I advise anyone that is reading this game to stay the hell away from this game, because the devs are either insane, or just don't care for honest feedback from people wanting to help them to make a better game and just wants to be praised for whatever crap they do to their game.  I'm officially done with this game, and I advise people to stay away from it, to avoid stressing yourselves up."
69958089,english,0,424370,"Despite the fact that the game underwent ALOT of reiterations, the final product unfortunatly is no longer what made the game unique in the first place on top of being a technical disaster in many ways.  Wolcen, formerly Umbra initially managed to get quite some attention with a broad skill system on top of the still existing talent wheel system. Though the wheel system in its core concept is still present, most nodes mostly just consist of simple stat bonuses that offer no noticeable benefit. There are a few nodes that actually do something to enhance your playstyle but these are quite rare and should have been added in a big quantity instead.  The ability perk system was another system that used to alter spells to a point where they totally escalate like launching 8 fireballs in a cone instead of now just having a slow missile that's not even great. The game should have embraced that level of craziness instead of being the sterile game that it is now.  Another major OOF is the removal of the open world. Umbra used to be open world so you could travel through the world with few up to no loading screens at all. That is completely gone. It's now a typical isolated area style of game where zones are being split by portal like doors and passages. A shame.  The story is okay'ish. It's not really special as it's basically: bad god wanna invade the world and control everything and (of course) you are the guy who will prevent that. However, also here is a big OOF: the story is not complete. There is a big chunk of content cut from the final part of the game as you can see that Stormfall changes during the final act while it has no context at all and we don't even get to fight the true bad guy of the story. Based on what is left of it inside the game, the best part of it was yet suposed to come but apparently they went out of time and hat to make a choice.  Artwise the game is gorgeous. The environments are beautiful and the music is pretty epic. Nothing to complain about here.  Now to the ugly part - the bugs. The game launched in a partially unplayable state. The multiplayer completely died for days and the singleplayer mode was riddled with bugs in all possible ways. From duplication exploits, over non-functional passives and skills up to losing all story progress for no reason. This went on for days and even today the game still has alot of things to flesh out.  But the true reason why they get my thumbs down... the only true reason: where the heck is the Driller?! (that's a joke btw)"
109249112,english,1,424370,"At launch, this game was not so great -- bugs, server issues, poor balancing, and ultimately an unsatisfying end game progression. But by now (early 2022), the game is everything I want out of an ARPG -- polished, wide variety of interesting skills, intricate yet not PoE-level-complex passive skill tree, fluid and challenging combat, and L O O T. Lewd loot to ogle at. It's almost silly how much time you spend picking up loot and examining it to see if you got something good, and almost every run you do get something that's at least worth chucking in to the crafting system.  There is a lot to do here yet, and I could see myself sinking a few hundred hours in to this yet.  Compared to other ARPGs: -Grim Dawn with expansions has a ton more content. Progression is slower, compared to the almost frenzied pace of finding upgrades in Wolcen. I like the combat and skill systems about equally. -Last Epoch is a long way from done, but shows a lot of promise and could be as good -Diablo 3 set a nicer standard for fluid combat with MMO elements like CC and party buffs and defensive skills becoming important. But the loot system in that game is F tier; this game is leaps and bounds better. -D2R is very grindy and there's no crafting and a very simple skill system. The appeal is mostly in the trade economy and the large player base. -Path of Exile is absurdly grindy. I love the skill system and variety of scenery and content in the endgame, but the pacing of finding gear upgrades gets slow and I lose interest.  If you like ARPG games, I think this is one of the best ones out there right now."
23826474,english,1,424370,"This game looks extremely promising. For an alpha its pretty stable and has actually a lot of content to offer. I really like, that I may explore the world while there are actually no quests to do (the available quest line will take you 1-1,5 hours to complete). There is a quite a lot of different loot to be found, so are skills. You will definitely get a few hours off the alpha at the current state.  So lets take a look at the game. I will concentrate more on the good things because its still an alpha. The first thing you will notice after starting the game is the quality of the graphics. Powered by the cry engine, the game creates really nice environments. The day-night cycle adds a lot of atmosphere. Running around in a pitch black dark forest is quite nasty. The lighting effects are really nice and add a lot of quality, especially to the magic effects.  Looking at the combat mechanics, this game has a nice system with two differents ressources. One of them is umbra and is more the ressource used by spells. The other one being rage which is filled by using certain spells or just by attacking. Both ressource balance each other out, if you use your umbra your rage increases and vice versa. This way you always have the possibility to use skills which is really nice. It also requires you to keep track on your ressources so you know which skills you may use at a certain time. Skills level up when used and may either be upgraded by increasing their power or optimising their cooldown / ressource cost. The character levels up by experience, you get attribute points and passive points when reaching the next level. The passive points allow you to strengthen your character in diffent ways (like your magic or offensive capabilities). The passive system is just your basic +% or +X to crit/something system. It would by more interesting if there would be synergies between the different trees or anything else which expands the system a bit.  I will update my review from time to time to reflect the changes the dev implements. So far the devs put out improvements on a regular basis and at a quite impressive pace. At this moment i can absolutely recommend this game!"
95332098,english,1,424370,"Wolcen is a solid and mostly conventional ARPG, but with some quirks that make it stand by itself. The interesting gameplay angle for me is how skill use is handled. Instead of using a singular resource like Mana to cast skills or spells, as is common in ARPGs since Diablo, there are two connected resources: Willpower and Rage. Using one builds the other. So, depending on the selection of weapons and skills/spells you're using, it's possible to use skills indefinitely (albeit potentially limited by cooldowns).   You won't be popping magic potions to enable you to use skills - rather, you will use one type of attack or skill which drains Willpower to deal damage while building up Rage, and then use another type of attack or skill to discharge that Rage, which frees up Willpower again. This means that you're actively being incentivized by the design of the game to use a good variety of skills and even to cross-class, rather than being rewarded for sticking to one skill tree, focusing only on one or two active skills, and sinking the rest of your points into passives (as some other ARPGs unfortunately fall into). This keeps your skill use varied and keeps combat engaging, by preventing you from falling into the trap of building a ""boring but effective"" character.  Graphically and in terms of audio design the game is great as well, and there's some stand-out voice acting from some of the major characters in the story. The story is suitably epic to keep you engaged in it for at least the first playthrough. Besides the story, if you like your build a lot and want to keep playing it after the story ends, there's a post-story mode which allows you to generate infinite random missions while using the resources you gain from this to build up a base, which in turn improves your ability to generate more interesting missions, find or craft better gear, etc. Personally I prefer to replay the story with a different build entirely than to grind away at the same character endlessly, but the option exists if you want it, which is great.  EDIT: Actually never mind, endgame is pretty fun with my current build, so I'm doing that too.  (Minor aside: most of the higher-tier pauldron designs are completely ridiculous, but you can put glamors on your armor pieces for free, so it's not a major problem.)  A lot of the negative reviews you'll see are about bugs which have been mostly addressed, or disappointment at the way that the development has been handled. Legitimate issues for sure, especially for those who have been following the game since its early development; apparently it was supposed to be an open-world game and became a more conventional Diablo-like as time went on. But I wasn't following the development and most bugs seem to have been addressed by now. If like me you're coming in fresh and don't have specific expectations on how the game should be, but just want a familiar Diablo- or Torchlight- or PoE-like single-player ARPG with a few unique gameplay twists in a fresh setting, Wolcen is a great pick."
61709639,english,1,424370,"Updated for release: Despite some initial (now seemingly resolved) issues with server uptime, stash disappearances, and player progression rollbacks, Wolcen is still an amazingly fun ARPG.  There is still some work that needs to be done to bolster the multiplayer aspects and perhaps polish up the character trees a bit, but overall the foundation they are building upon is rock solid.  Character customization is rare in ARPGs so I welcome it, I love the ability to mix abilities and playstyles, and I even enjoy the story so far which is rare in games of this ilk.    Some players are upset with the challenges the game and team has faced and while their frustration is understandable and I too have been disappointed at times, we have to remember that this is not an enormous team and that it is no small thing to build a game of this quality and studio around it; things will take time.  That's my opinion anyway.    I discovered Wolcen originally in 2018 and loved the concept of it, but unfortunately soon after my initial introduction to the game the team scrapped the build and rebuilt the entire game from the ground up.  There was a significant delay of about a year as the game was developed, which precipitated much of the vitriol you see in some reviews from the community.  Some players felt they were short changed on the original concept of the game, which I can understand, but I personally was willing to give them a second chance.  I'm glad I did.  The game has truly be entirely re-designed and conceptually reworked; it now boasts a steampunk aesthetic, cutscenes, and a more coherent story than before.  Thus far, I've been having an utter blast and praise the developers for taking such a big chance and sticking to their vision even with all the pushback from the community.  Well done; going to play this one extensively!"
60663993,english,1,424370,"Currently at the time of writing, this game is in beta, and it is feeling quite good. Pretty smooth playing and the controls feel good. I've had a few hiccups and bugs, but this is expected and therefore I'm not concerned with it as I can simply just go and post on the Wolcen forums.  I do not know the history of the game or what was sold to people, but as an ARPG, I'm happy.  It is less complex than PoE, and more complex than Diablo 3, which for me is perfect as I cannot deal with the sheer complexity of PoE builds at this time in my life, but wanted something a little bit more than Diablo 3 in terms of build variety.  tldr: the game looks good, it feels good, it has bugs, the devs are working on it, it is overall enjoyable and pretty affordable."
135010202,english,0,424370,"Other reviews have (rightfully) discussed all the bugs, so instead I want to cover the absolute mess that is the over all game design up to and including Act 4.  The marketing tells you skills can be customized with 16 different modifiers each, however almost all of them consist of ""deal 15% more damage"". Most skills don't have any meaningful choices beyond ""Summon one less minion but more damage.""  For a classless game, you're still restricted on what skills you can use by your weapons. Unfortunately there's no main-hand spell weapon, so it's impossible to cast spells with a shield. The weapon restriction is a bigger issue than it might seem since it highlights how few skills there actually are in the game. There are 12 Warrior skills, 13 Rogue skills (Daggers get to use Warrior and some Rogue skills, so they are an exception) and 18 Mage skills, of which 4 are summon-related. Since you can slot 6 skills at a time, there's not much real choice unless you go for a hybrid build.  The rotating passive wheel is a much better idea in practice. It actually heavily restricts freedom since you are still bound by what sections are adjacent and the devs decided that different sections (Warrior, Mage, and Rogue) should never be next to their related sections, so you have to path all over the place just to make a simple Two-Hander build, for instance. And there are so few sections in total that if you want to be a Warrior character and survive early you better build around Block since that's your only option in the second ring. Thankfully pathing is not expensive, but that leads to another problem where you end up with so many passive points that there are no real choices to make in your build, though I guess that's fine because most passive nodes are pretty boring anyways, including the big notable ones.  Speaking of being better in practice, it's amazing the ""Resource Opposition System"" survived Alpha, much less a single proof of concept. Playing a melee character and want to use your sweet shield charge ability to engage enemies? Better hope there's crates nearby to generate Rage, because by default you lose ALL of your Attack resource after combat. The only way around this is to build your passive tree around rushing to a specific 3rd tier node that causes your Rage to regenerate instead of your Willpower. I don't know if I can think of a worse way to handle this, to be honest. If skills are going to be locked behind your weapons, have your weapons decide your ""equilibrium point"". All melee? Rage regenerates and Willpower fades away. Half and half? Have them balance out to 50/50. Even hybrid builds are made super clunky by this since if you don't have the necessary resource and you try to use a skill, your character does nothing. Why don't you auto-attack when out of resources since that generates? Instead, when you need to be teleporting away from danger, you're just standing in middle of it.  Entering Act 4 as someone who never played Wolcen before now is super confusing. The story goes from climax to immediate cliffhanger to your character suddenly showing up at the city from Act I and being VERY concerned about an NPC you met once at the beginning of the game. No explanation for the time gap or even what happened, and apparently no other characters are even worried about whether or not the Big Bad is still roaming around? I get that part of the point of the story is that you are supposed to figure out as a player what happened to your character, but last time you were in the (single) main city, the entire thing was falling apart and it was filled with refugees. Then you get to Act 4 and everything is fine  all of a sudden and no one even mentions what happened to make things better.   Also, the (Act 4) voiced dialogue constantly differs from the on-screen text dialogue, and in three back-to-back conversations seconds apart, a captured enemy was immune to pain so you had to send for a specialist alchemist to get a truth serum, then when you go to send for the guy, instead your only option is for your court alchemists to work on a solution for the spell that is keeping him immune to pain, then after clicking the button to do so, you are told that the alchemists successfully cleared the no-pain-drugs from his system. Which is it? Spell or drugs? In addition, the tutorials for the endgame systems that are introduced in Act 4 clearly haven't been updated since its release, since they tell you to start Infrastructure projects that don't exist and congratulate you on successfully completing a project that wasn't even an option, much less one you did.  While some of the issues are baked into the DNA of the game, many others are either bugs that have existed since launch 3 years ago or design issues that they could solve in a single patch or even caught by a single QA person playing the opening of the brand new act with the sound on and also reading the text.  Ultimately it's clear that the Wolcen devs don't care in the least about their own game, so why should we?  If you're desperate for a new ARPG, it's fine at $10 USD but I wouldn't pay a cent more."
121294575,english,0,424370,"I played it a lot when it first came out. It was a mess then, without a doubt. I came back when they did the Wyvern or Dragon update and it was still a buggy mess.

137534697,english,1,424370,"7/10 Decent game with very high potential but the team of developers are either not many enough to go up the ladder or they don't care about it anymore.  Pos: * Good RPG elements for a Hack&Slash game with one of the most intriguing and complex skill build i have ever seen in long time  * Weapons and armour easy to combo with preferred skill combination * Good graphics & skills animation * Similarities to Diablo games but not as evolved and tested as Blizzard's. * Keeps you in front of PC. Cons: * Poor storyline * Mediocre voice acting * The game itself seems to be unfinished, unpolished and sometimes unplayable because of the servers/region * Because i couldn't find a way for transmuting gems or combine it, i realised how useless is to keep it in the stash and how a waste of time was arranging it in the hope later i will have the option to make it stronger ones (if i haven't discovered the way to do that but there is an option, then my apologies...) * Very buggy for a game released 2-3 years ago. That was something totally unexpected and unpleasantly surprised * The Multiplayer option is DEAD! Either very long times to connect with someone or not working at all in specific regions. * The loophole involving rising in level for no reason and doing the same thing over and over again, just to get stronger and bigger is so cheeky and ... disgraceful. Probably developers were having a meeting regarding new content release or DLC's and decided to just give as a way to continuing playing the game but without NEW chapters, maps, stories, viable MULTIPLAYER option or something much more exciting. BREADCRUMBS.  Anyway! I believe it's first time in my life when i give a thumbs up or good review to a game which has more cons than pos's and the reason why is simple. I enjoyed playing it for those few 65h aprox and i still reckon it has a lot of potential with a proper team and funding behind.  I'm not a professional gamer or critic, just writing my opinion in a personal way, describing with my own words the experience i had, not trying to be to fuzzy about specific content. Before buying something i read most of the times reviews by amateurs like me as i do not trust nowadays the professional youtuber's or gaming websites for simple reason that they get payed sometimes for those reviews and this have a tendency to influence the decision about rating the game itself. Always trust the ""little people"" as they will have no hidden interest behind their decisions of rating a game in a good or bad way, at least most of them/us.

45623922,english,1,424370,I just have one thing to say. I've backed this game for a long time and you all have the oppritunity to replace Diablo in the spotlight while they grab for cash.  Do not fck this up. Think about the game from the players POV and it will be gold.

Apparently it was released unfinished 2 years ago, with chapters 4 and 5 ""to come"". So far the developer seems to be only adding ""endgame content"" (killing the same monsters on the same maps over and over again without any reason or purpose) to a game that doesn't have an ending. Safe to assume it will stay unfinished. Very sad, since what exists of the story is fun&engaging and the world is cool."

50075926,english,0,424370,"UPDATE 14/2/2020:  So where to begin, I've left the old review up as I believe its important to see the behaviour of the developers and mods, and also the treatment of people who backed and funded their game. But here we are and it has actually released... sort of  So as expected its now just 3 acts (not the original promised 5) and the game is much much smaller in scope, no overworld areas at all, not even anything as open as D3 has. Now this in of itself is not a huge deal, I enjoyed aspects of D3 (post ROS) maps don't need to be big seemless affairs like say Grim Dawns, but it is a loss to the original vision of the game (imo)   The builds feel more limited and generic, there are signs everywhere of where they have wholesale stolen ideas (even visuals) from other games and titles, now generally they are done pretty well but it has like zero originality. The visuals feel like Warhammer/40k rip offs mixed elements of Tyranny. The skills and skill system feel like Lost Ark and D3 had a baby (but not as good as either yet)   The targetting is still wonky even after all these years (was an issue in original alpha I presume its related to cryengine not liking isometric games) the jolts in quality can be seen all over the place in terms of a rushed release. Sometimes you'll be happily killing stuff smooth as you like and it all clicks and you'll be like 'hell yeah this is fun' then suddenly your targetting messes up or a hitbox doesn't register or you click on something and it just refused to accept it exists (etc etc) and your ripped out of the moment and just feel annoyed that they have come so close to making something good but haven't... yet  Now for the positive bit, I will hold my hands up it is much better than I expected but then I expected it to be total garbage so take that however you want. I already own the game if I didn't I don't think I'd buy it now based on what currently exists so my thumbs down will remain. BUT if your a diablolike loot game fan there is fun to be had here just expect and unpolished buggy poorly optimised mess... before I go some highlights of awfulness in the current release version  - Character models are horrific ugly and bad - Servers are a joke, expect to attempt multiple times to connect online - And when you do connect expect random weird disconnects at times that just throw you back to the menu without any error message or warning - Expect weird messages like 'Your client timed out' and yet you can still happily play on regardless - I can already see aspects where they are going to insert their grubby cash shop and squeeze the players for money  - Balance is an utter mess both of mobs and player skills to numerous to even detail - Numerous skills simply dont work as intended - Story is so cringe inducing it feels like an emo 16 year old with a penchant for Warhammer fan fiction wrote it - Various bugs that freeze you out of the game, chuck you back to the menu or ctd even in offline mode - As of writing this servers have now been down 3 days with no end in sight due to unforseen issues, my personal theory is a major flaw or bug has been picked up they aren't telling people about cause seriously it does not take this long to roll back a database.  Now none of those are game killers but considering the developers track record of how they deal with issues and criticism yeah if money is an issue I'd hold off on this one till a few months time, its currently unstable and deeply flawed with a bad group of developers who have managed to salvage something half decent from a mess of a kickstarter and then proceeded to nearly kill it at birth with an awful launch... grats  Also see below for old review and all the features promised in kickstarter that don't exist at launch.  OLD REVIEW:Terrible terrible scam of a game... don't believe me go check out the old details on their own website for a game that used to be called Umbra.  Stay a while and listen adventurer.  Once upon a time some ambitious developers promised us the pinnacle of ARPGs, it would have full open world maps, customising everything right down to what hilt we would have on weapons, player housing and an innovative dungeon system where you build dungeons for others to challenge, a headline feature called apocalyptic form that offered a new way of making your characters unique. They kickstarted the game got lots of money and promised lots of features.  Fast forward to today the game has been scrapped and started again TWICE now, every time the goals and ambitions of the project get more and more narrow, as of the current beta they dont even have a female character model its something (and i quote one of the developers directly here) they ""Hope to add back in at release""  The list of broken promises, half truths, outright lies, bad PR, bad communication, contempt for their fans is honestly to long to go into. Just recently a forum member discovered by judiciously reading the terms of service on the new beta (or alpha v2.0 as i like to call it) that they intend to implement a microtransactions cash shop for 'just cosmetic' items. This was never in their plans, in fact as early as late last year the lead developer stated they ""Had no intention of having a cash shop"" yet here we are with them preparing to have one just like POE does, except In a full price game. Note the conflict here with the huge level of customisation they promised in the original kickstarter.  Whats more the recent beta (alpha v2.0 in everything but name) is more limited and simplistic than the original alpha we had 2 years ago. Of course go to the forums and you'll see the usual white knight brigade saying how 'its a beta if you dont like it leave' except this isn't the beta I or many other backed, they did a total 180 on us and changed the whole scope of the project to some generic Diablo rip off with boring mechanics and a cash shop. Features like housing, dungeons all that is gone never spoken of, who knows it might get implemented some time around 2050 at this rate.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY wait till they release it (so never most likely)"
96311004,english,1,424370,"I wasn't there at launch of this game so I have no animosity towards this title unlike others. My thoughts are from a single player offline experience.  Pros   -Incredible Graphics with highly detailed Items and landscapes.   -Awesome combat system   -A compelling story with epic villains.   -The boss battles   -Large variety of Landscapes and villains   -Runs quite well. Can't think of single problem I've had.    -The overall aesthetic is just awesome, a blend of Warhammer 40k and Dark Fantasy.    -Great character progression.   -Extensive campaign. Cons.   -Not a fan of having separate characters for offline and online play.   -Extensive campaign. (It's going to suck trying to make multiple characters in a reasonable time.)    9/10  Must buy for ARPG fans."

50524556,english,0,424370,"This review may change...  At this point the game completely changed from something unique that was promising, to a Diablo clone. I had high hopes for this and about a year ago it was good. They shifted direction so much that it's not even remotely what the vision used to be. I'm still hopeful but to be honest it's probably just gonna be a failed Diablo clone with the direction it's going.  Update:  I'm sorry but these people don't know what they are doing. I've had this game for a long time and in the beginning it had so much potential with cool new ideas, beautiful artwork, open-world exploration, a skill tree that seemed to have limitless customization and a lot more than I'd rather not get into considering most of all of that is completely gone and replaced with some cookie cutter wanna-be Diablo clone and it's depressing. I don't recommend buying this game to anyone considering. Wait until it is fully released IF it ever is fully released. They have scrapped everything original about this game and restarted with nothing to write home about.  Update#2: Still trash. Nuff said...  Update#3: Still trash. These people really just screwed themselves. Should have stuck to making something new and not cloning other games. Kinda sad..."
92514356,english,1,424370,"Over 70 hours of gameplay on the clock, so thought it time to review this game.  TL;DR - This game is an excellent example of an ARPG/Hack-and-Slash. It may have its origins in a Diablo/Path of Exile clone, but it is far more than that and I'm actually preferring it to them. It's great fun and probably worth the full price. End game is best in class as far as I'm concerned - Fully realised with an actual purpose.  So, I've just completed the main game and now into end game. I'm still having a blast. Really glad I finally tried this game in spite of the negative reviews. Those reviews seem to stem from the history of a poor release and early bug scene but I can't presume to know everyone's motives. And it is a situation I couldn't blame them for either, but one I luckily avoided arriving a year late. I have encountered some bugs but they haven't been significant. It does feel like this game needs some further polish and tweaks, but again nothing that detracts fundamentally from the great game play. Players asserting this game is 'dead' are entirely unfounded, with the evidence of recent patches and regular development updates and the simple fact I am actively playing a great ARPG with friends.  It has to be said Wolcen is very obviously taking a great deal of its game mechanics directly from Path of Exile and Diablo 3. But this isn't surprising or novel. Beyond that Wolcen has its own vibe and some great little mechanics of its own. Wolcen is the most graphically beautiful APRG I've seen yet and the Cryengine works great in here. The astonishing graphics here made me realise one of the main reasons why I never completely got into Grim Dawn (in spite of playing for a couple hundred hours). Going for a classless system is interesting and I've always liked it since the days of Dungeon Siege. At the very least it stops me from feeling I'm playing another copy of some pool of classic builds. I would really have liked there to be a much greater diversity of character appearance choices to counter this because there are fundamentally no more than 5 looks per sex currently - which is ridiculous considering how easy this would be to implement. The active dodge gives the game a surprisingly enjoyable extra dimension I wouldn't, on paper, have expected to be this fundamental. It immediately brings a level of tactics and skill generally absent from ARPG games. But it also makes you feel your character more dynamic. The skills are varied, impactful and fun - some of them have real oomph to them. The ability to modify each one in fundamental ways is an excellent game choice reminiscent of Path of Exile's support gem design. One thing I have noticed so far is the game seems to encourage variability in skills and attack strategy. This means I'm using the full skillbar of 5 actions frequently in each encounter which stops the feeling of spamming one super skill continually many other ARPGs seem to fall into. Collecting them in loot drops and levelling them independently of your character is again very PoE but works well. It also avoids the frustrating trap of having to find items that will cater for the skills you want that PoE creates (although I wouldn't argue with you if you felt that was a feature). The items I have to admit I'm still getting used to, but the lack of a straight armour class stat is interesting and opens up the item collection in interesting ways. The almost direct rip off of the talent tree from PoE I just can't argue with because to me it is currently the best way of implementing this. The literal twist to it works great too. I also love the fact that this game is not built on the depressing requirement to play through 3 times to reach the end game. It was always a lame way of hiding a lack of content and story. The Boss fights so far have been some of my favourite in any ARPG. They've challenged me in the exactly the right way. The phases and pacing of the bosses have been brilliant, and pushed me to move and use space tactically. Giving characters three in-combat revives (Revive tokens) is an excellent way of preventing the frustration of an insta-kill or a simple mistake ruining the flow and experience.  The ability to modify and paint your character's gear is pretty inconsequential but is a nice touch and does, to some extent, make up for the lack of character appearance adjustment at the beginning. I also love the 'God-mode' or Avatar of Destruction. It isn't essential, but it is a heck of a lot of fun! The voice acting is generally pretty good and the dialogue is sharp and witty - some of it made me laugh out loud.  My criticisms are generally minor. Obviously they do need to prioritise fixing the bugs and improving stability - but again, I appear to arrived at the point where playability is no longer seriously impacted by any. I think there may be too many trash mobs making general progression at times seem a bit too easy. This is countered by the sprinkling of interesting elites with equally interesting abilities which at times require rapid adaptation. Despite all the interactive terrain features I would like to be able to go into more buildings and access more land features. I would also favour a little more sideline areas to make the progression feel less linear, but it's not a major issue here and there are plenty of side dungeons scattered around. Grim Dawn would be a good comparison for great map design. Overall the story campaign is very linear with virtually no side quests. Again, Grim Dawn would be a good example of how to do an interesting quest structure. I was surprised at how quickly the first two tiers of items (normal and magic) became completely obsolete, but this may be just be amnesia of every other ARPG on my part. The vendors really need to shut up after a while!  The long-term lastability of Wolcen will essentially rest upon the end-game, and I may check in again to update my review once I've played end game for a while, but basically the main game is in my opinion solid."
84601932,english,1,424370,"With a little over a couple hundred hours in game, I can recommend this one BUT, and a big but, be aware of what you're getting.  If you've read any of the other reviews then you're aware that the game is a buggy mess and the balancing issues are a work in progress, so I won't go too much into them; everyone else already has.  Considering the game has almost been out for a year and some bugs that I encountered on day one are still in the game is alarming.  But improvements have been made to both bugs and balancing so I guess there's something to be said for that.  Just read the reviews and make sure you can tolerate the game in it's current state.  That being said lets talk about why I like this game.  It's Beautiful.  No other ARPG can touch it on that one.  Also, it sounds great.  I crank the volume up high when I'm playing.  Combat feels great.  When you consider that the main point of an  ARPG is to go around slaying monsters by the thousands, then you want it to feel good while you do.  And Wolcen does just that.  It truly looks, sounds and feels great to spend hours slaying monsters.  Some reviewers have commented that the end game is redundant and boring but then again so is D3 and POE in that regard.  Again, in an ARPG you just slay monsters over and over again and in Wolcen that feels better than others.  Admittedly I think they could spice things up in the end game, but it's not that bad.  Another point that reviewers often gripe about is the crafting.  It's plenty in depth enough and the rewards for doing so CAN be there.  But as may others have said, you're basically playing a lottery where you can slightly shift odds in your favor.  Some hate that because you can never get the ""perfect"" gear.  They think that with enough work and investment you should get the perfect piece.  On the contrary, I like that you can never get the perfect piece, but rather keep trying and trying and eventually a piece comes out slightly better than the last and it's an upgrade.  In other words you are constantly getting better gear and working towards perfect but you'll never get there.  I actually like it that way.  Lastly, the theory crafting and ""builds"".  For me, Wolcen hit that sweet spot between D3 and POE.  D3 is too straight forward.  There's basically one right way to play your class.  And POE, well, we all know that one.  In D3 I usually play my class as the meta for the season.  In POE I give up and look up a youtube video.  In Wolcen, I make my own build.  I play around, test and tinker my way to something that works.  It's in the sweet spot where it's not so overwhelming that you just borrow someone else's work, but its not so straight forward that you can only play the game one way.    I recommend this one, but do you research.  Read all the other reviews and make sure you know if this game is for you.  I'm posting what I like about it because maybe someone is thinking about the game but can't find anything good about it buried in all the reviews about how bad the bugs and balance are.  I'm not saying those reviews aren't valid because they absolutely are.  I'm just saying through all the problems there is quite a bit to like about the game."
63480332,english,0,424370,"Currently a buggy mess. Played into act 2 and had to restart, where it sent me back to the beginning of the game at level 25. Lost all my waypoints and quests. Wait until they fix this up and lots of people say it's stable."
84770747,english,1,424370,"I have about 108 hours into Wolcen now. There is still a lot of game breaking bugs that shouldn't exist at this stage and the campaign was so bugged that I had to play the last mission 7-10 times in a row because it bugged out. Its almost to the point the campaign feels unbeatable solely due to bugs.   That being said, I freaking love this game. I wish I could come on here and say ""its not worth the money, don't buy"" however, I cant because at the end of all the bugs is a game that has so much promise and a very engaging and fun play style for the ARPG genre.   I wont talk mechanics because you can look those up on youtube. I just wanted to be one of the honest reviewers and say, this game has play value and replay value even with the overwhelming amount of bugs and sometimes crashes (for online play).   All in all, if you are a big fan of ARPG's and want a new one to play. I can fully back that this game is worth the money. I won't try to hide its problems from the bugs. (I cannot stress enough that there are tons of bugs and am purposely being repetitive, because I dont want to be what made you comfortable purchasing the game and then not be able to overlook the bugs)  The ONLY gamer I would say that should heavily avoid Wolcen are those who are only after an ARPG for the multiplayer experience. Please do not buy if you are not intending on playing solo and trying multiplayer occasionally to see if its running decent for the night.  I am the type that will get in discord and discuss what I am finding, doing, and experiences with my friends who are also playing solo and I believe that is the type of player who will find this game to be great even through its issues.   Long repetitive ""review"" over. Hope that sheds a slim amount of light on why its listed as mixed reviews."
64157392,english,0,424370,"I normally dont write bad reviews. But this is an exception.   Today patch 1.0.5.0 dropped. What a desaster - these devs obviously have no clue what they are doing. Bleeding edge needed a nerf, no question, but they nerfed the WHOLE passive tree. They altered different skills and descriptions completely which are not part of the patch notes.   I have played 133hours since release, accumulated ALOT of gold and affinity, have 4 chars with over level 50, 2 over 70 and ALL chars earnings where ERASED to 100.000 gold each and 10.000 affinity. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? Whole progress of last week was completely wiped. Also running projects were canceled (guess what, these costs are gone too), items disappeared (quality, rarity upgrades).   When i played the game over the last 4 years since closed alpha, i had high hopes for this one. But today and after 230hours, i applied for a refund. Enough is enough.  This game is a broken, buggy mess. And the nice graphics doesnt help either.  I am done with this."
48380992,english,0,424370,"Vapourware. Buyer beware. The devs of this game would rather send threatening private messages trying to dissaude you from making negative comments, than actually communicate positively with their community.  They don't update, they don't give dates, they recycle the same promo material over and over and just make empty promises that are never fulfilled.  With these guys, it's always ""next week"" but next week never comes. Literally been a year with no updates, on a 3 year old EA product, with little to no marked improvement during that time.

128140687,english,1,424370,"I have one MAJOR gripe with this game so far.  And that's with the limited tiny space for stash inventory. The stash inventory space amount is way too tiny for the average player.  It's extremely frustrating.  Every time I visit the Stash Inventory chest, all I want to do is log the hell off, because its so annoying. Each Tab for Stash inventory should be at least 4x to 8x as large from what it is now. People like to stash weapons and armor for other characters they create but cant because of the EXTREMELY limited stash space given. In games like this, Stash Inventory should be MUCH MUCH more, because this game depends on players, to collect items throughout their game play and you cant do that, if the player is hindered and limited in the Stash Inventory. This needs to be fix ASAP.  This is a Great game to play, and I do recommend people to play it if they like games like, Path Of Exile, Victor Vran, Grim Dawn, Lost Ark  So on and so forth.   Also IMHO, the game looks better when its dark,  because everything else glows really awesome. When you first start the game, everything is so bright, but then at a certain point when you complete a certain mission and go back to the main town, its dark and it looks really really nice. ( I like it a lot).  I was forced to play in OFF-LINE Mode, because the online mode would not let me log back on the next to when I wanted to continue the game. I made it to level 18 in online mode. I logged off because it was really late. When I logged back on the next day to continue, the game would not let me continue as all I got was a black screen instead.  So I was forced to start all over again from level 1 via OFF-LINE Mode.  Also I wish I could sell the skills instead of installing the skills I don't want. This game forces players to install the skill first in order for you to sell the extra skills for Primotial. Which is very annoying. I SHOULD be able to sell the skills if I don't want them.   I have more stuff to say,  but I will continue to play first before I add onto this review. Again, This overall is a great game to play for those who have not played it yet. It just has a few things that are very annoying.   Thanks for reading."
107917693,english,1,424370,"[h1] Solid ARPG Experience [/h1]   [b] History [/b]   This game has come a long way since its Early Access days. As reflected in the Steam user review ratings, it has been a rocky road for Wolcen Studio and their flagship title. I've played it off and on since very early in its development. I've seen it go through some major changes and overhauls. The game we have today resembles the original very little. At one point you could even build your own house to display your trophies. It seemed that Wolcen didn't know which direction to go.    They wanted a dark and grim fantasy world ARPG. Hardcore gamers themselves, they wanted to make what they thought Diablo 3 should have been, a lofty and admirable goal. It took them some time to figure out what the fans wanted, but they did, and now it finally shows. This is one of those titles that would have been better off waiting for full release rather than making it available in early access, since current ratings reflect earlier stages of the game. It's a win for players, but the devs take it by way of long-standing negative reviews that remain long after they become irrelevant.    What we ended up with here seems like a compromise between the dev's vision and what the fans wanted. The game is much more like D3 than the devs would probably like to admit, right down to the voice actors and their lines. [url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2478830/] Carla Tassara [/url] ,who apparently does all the female lines in every video game now, is still ""unstoppable!""   [b] Current [/b]   A little history out of the way, the game is currently a solid ARPG experience that fans of the genre are sure to love. If you were disappointed by the early state of the game, now is a great time to dive in and start working a build. A big endgame update is on the way this month, offering 4 new game modes, and I'm excited for that.    What makes Wolcen different from D3, Grim Dawn and PoE? The classless build system. You choose a starting weapon and from there you can adapt your build however you like. Stats are determined by items, equipment and gear. You get your 10 attribute points per level, and passive skill points, to allocate however you like. Certain gear set-ups allow you to hybridize and optimize across different skill sets. You can use both magic and melee if you want. And you can switch it up at any time. This allows for an unprecedented level of freedom in your build. So far I've made a Void Witch, a Toxic Assassin, a Blood Baron, a Holy Crusader, a Pyromancer, and more, some of them from the same character.   Skills and abilities have real impact, they feel nice and weighty, very satisfying to play. Certainly there is a difficulty curve between mobs and bosses. Clearing mobs is no indicator of your ability to take on a big boss. While I haven't had to grind over already tread paths, the option is there if you need it. If you falter at the bosses, it is 100% your build, which is easily remedied by grinding and/or trying something different. The latter is not easily achievable, if at all, in other games in this genre. In Wolcen, you can switch up gear and tweak stats a bit, and voila! a whole new class to try without starting a new character.   The game looks amazing, built on CryEngine, it is more detailed than any top-down isometric I've ever played. It is truly stunning to explore the different environments. The gameworld is a work of art, and the 3D models for everything from gear to actors are no less aesthetic. This is a labor of love and it truly shows.   If you tried it before and walked away with a bad taste, try it again, you will be pleasantly surprised. Wolcen is a must-play for any ARPG fan.  *My ReShade preset [url=https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/11817/] Wolcen Grit RTX [/url]"

94006446,english,0,424370,"I came into it initially positive, but largely unsure of what I was getting myself into. I had a few thousand hours in PoE at this point and had recently burned out on D3. Suffice to say, the initial experience was very good - in fact, I'd say this game is honestly ahead of the curve of the current crop of ARPGs. It looks and feels like a next-gen ARPG in the vein of PoE2. I was very impressed with the game overall...right until I finished the main story. The story starts out alright, continues to be alright with some questionable plot twists, and then completely crashes and burns because of Heimlock. Not spoiling anything, but he's the most bullshit character ever written and the last 20 minutes of the story drove me continually more and more insane until the ending made me scream and still remains my favourite thing to rant about to anyone who will listen.  Beyond that, my experience up to that point had been very good. The ability system works well and allows for decent customisation, but there are some egregious cases of absurdly powerful combinations. Combat is very dynamic with an emphasis on using every one of your skill slots for a purpose, and dodging is just nice to have. Bosses are...mostly well designed, more readable, more convincing and more involving than some of PoE's bosses, but also easier to cheese. I did however find fault with targeting being horrific especially for melee, I continually found myself either running circles around what I wanted to attack, or being unable to stop attacking a target to interact with something or attack the thing next to it; it just never does what you want it to. Pacing feels a little weird, as there are groups of enemies predictably spaced out with considerable distance between them throughout every area, and on top of that enemy variety feels lacking with a lot of mooks wearing different shirts. There is also a distinct lack overall in abilities to use which hinders the variety in playstyles, The passive skill tree is a nice idea implemented poorly, with a mess of passives that seem to have no distinct rhyme or reason to what stats they give you or where they lead, often with notables that contribute very little to your build in comparison to just dumping points in random passives that lead nowhere. Oh, and Aspects of Apocalypse exist. Don't get hyped for them, they're almost completely useless after you beat the main story, because they don't scale with your character. All your stats are set to 0 when you activate them and your gear has no effect, so you'll rapidly outgrow their capabilities and they'll serve only to give you a temporary HP boost if you're in a bad spot.  Endgame feels like a pointless exercise, which may sound rich coming from someone that played D3 and PoE, but hear me out. You are to rebuild the city of Stormfall by way of constructing notable building projects and launching Expeditions, which are three randomly generated dungeon stages that can be modified for greater rewards by spending a small sum of gold or using a map item. Completing them grants Productivity which is scaled by your finished city projects and the difficulty of the expedition. There are a large number of projects to undertake which either grant you bonuses directly, like increased gold and magic find or unlocking an extra ability slot, or open up greater crafting options and new shops. The problem is...I can't find a point to any of them. There is no real goal that you're working towards other than ticking all the boxes on the Stormfall map. D3 wasn't much better so I can't say much there, but PoE is in a different league (haha) to Wolcen. Where Wolcen asks you to just pootle around doing whatever until you get bored, PoE tantalises you with bossfights, extra story, unique items and of course, better and more loot. For a time it was a big deal working your way to the centre of the Atlas to fight and beat the Shaper, and if you wanted to get that far you had to grind your map progress, push yourself and refine your build to perfection. In Wolcen...there's no drive. You can stay fighting level 40 enemies forever if you want, because there's not much reason to go any further. Maybe if you're an obsessive completionist you'll find fun here, but I've already burned out on it very rapidly twice over.  Lastly, a note on Bloodstorm, bugs/performance and ongoing development: I've played through the game twice, before and after Bloodstorm, and burned out on Stormfall restoration shortly after starting it both times. Bloodstorm is a...rather underwhelming update that adds a league-style mechanic to the base game and expeditions that's slightly neat but feels mostly inconsequential, and includes a new side story completely unrelated to the absolute bullshit main story that I doubt will ever be addressed. Supposedly it included a lot of performance updates and bugfixes, I've never had any noticeable issues with either in the past or recently but I've seen a lot of reviews slamming the game for terrible optimisation and game-breaking issues, so YMMV. As for development...I bought and played the game a year ago, and so far it seems the side story, league mechanic thingy and some new areas are the only new content they've brought out. There's been some tweaks to the passive tree and updates to abilities, as well as the aforementioned bugfixes, but otherwise it seems to have been fairly stagnant and I wouldn't hold out hope for things to suddenly turn around.  TL;DR, it's a decent game for a while, but is shallow and trying desperately to cover up its lack of development and refinement. Worth buying on sale if you need an ARPG fix, but it doesn't feel like it rewards your time investment in the end. It just feels like the developers dreamed up a vibrant world full of characters and lore and spent all their budget on voice acting and visuals, then realised this alone wasn't going to make a game and the remainder of the time and budget was spent piecing together an ARPG. Also screw Heimlock, all my homies hate Heimlock."

Better luck with the next patch. And any kind of communication from the developers is still non-existent. I don't think they're even considering cakes.[/b]  Publishing $20 extended soundtracks when your game, which was promising, is in a rather sorry state, lost most of it's players faster than DC it's audience after the Martha/Moustache fiasco, is still fuller of bugs than a medieval rat catcher's straw bed after a week of work, has an almost non-existent and pointless endgame and your communication with what's left of the playerbase (your loyalists) on all fronts is in the ""Let them eat cake"" area is an absolutely brilliant business decision. Best guess? You're trying to upstage Sean Murray in a few years time? Yes/No/Maybe?  With that out of the way, should you buy this game in it's current state? Short answer, no. There's nothing on offer here that you can't get in Path of Exile, Grim Dawn or even Last Epoch, which is in early access, but cheaper and with a more responsive team behind it.  After 90 hours, and some time spent in the endgame (up to lv139 expedition, no point in going any further), the expeditions became boring. The town building aspect the game features in the endgame is a good idea and fun in the beginning, but once you realize most buildings have no actual effect on the gameplay and those that do don't really change anything, it becomes a wasteful time sink. As does the ""crafting"" system the game features. It's hilariously expensive, ineffectual and has more in common with Konami's gambling machines than any actual crafting. The loot drops and upgrades are less epic than the reception Epic Games Store recieved when it opened it's flimsy doors, legendaries are underwhelming and unique items are almost completely useless apart from a few which are almost mandatory for useful builds.  The game features a passive skill tree which will be immediately familiar to any Path of Exile players with a few extra twists. That's a lot of skills and possible variations. Too bad most of them are useless and using them will effectively gimp you in the endgame, thus forcing you to use the same skills and builds (or at least similar) everybody else does if you want to progress to harder expeditions. The summoner builds were grossly underwhelming, with horrible AI and terrible scaling, but this seems to have been addressed in the latest patch (1.0.14, May 13th). Active skills are based on enneracts that are buyable in town and drop as loot from monsters. Skills can level up and have modifiers which you can mix and match, but not all the modifiers seem to actually be working, even after a few patches.  The combat controls are wonky, that's the best way to put it. There's something off with them and there's a visible delay on skills firing off. You can see the on-screen button getting pressed when you press the keyboard button, but it sometimes takes a few presses for the skill to actually register. ARPG combat is usually fast and frantic, but targeting in Wolcen really doesn't help with that. There were times when I clicked on a mob and the character never did anything or went to pick up loot which was near the mob I clicked. I even witnessed a character unable to attack a mob because he was in the middle of it and I had to ""move out"" of the mob to attack it. There's a dodge mechanic in the game based on a stamina system that's equally wonky due to animation locks and the mentioned skill delays. There's a very noticeable difference in difficulty between normal mobs and boss fights and it's somewhat ridiculous and poorly balanced, no matter what your build is.  Champions of Stormfall (the endgame) rewards for finishing expeditions is abysmal, even the high level ones. There's no gold drop scaling with higher expedition levels. Or any scaling that actually has any effect. I've found items with a high level difference between them, but no actual improvements on their stats. Oh, and there's a thing called mandates that you can do instead of expeditions. I think I clicked on one, once, in another dimension? Grinding out the town building part is tedious with no promise of any substantial or even noticeable rewards. Experience gains also drastically slow, to a snails pace, somewhere around lv 70, maximum level is 90. There's some serious grind involved getting to 90 (badly padding out the game in lieu of non-existent endgame?), like working in a mind melting office job.  The game also touts something called the Aspects of the Apocalypse, ""...one of the 4 Celestial incarnations available, each of them offering 4 different skills, and one devastating ultimate"". I've used it exactly once and it was part of the story. It was supposed to be something useful, useable and fun. It came out as useless, underpowered and completely forgettable.  The only redeeming quality, if I can call it that, is the game's visuals. They're really top notch for today's standards, but the performance is all over the place. I've had serious FPS drops on an RTX2070, 32GB of RAM, i7 and an SSD.  There were, there probably still are, a lot of good ideas for this game, but it went haywire somewhere. The main game page still has ""...regular updates and seasonal events..."" and a long term commitment statement from the developers. They've done a couple of small updates (which are around 3GB in size, go figure) which are purportedly fixing bugs and they've laid out some kind of a longer road map (catch-all term in the gaming industry nowadays), but there's a lot of work here in the controls, balancing, itemization, scaling and getting some goodwill back from the larger part of the community. The ethereal 1.1.0 that the developers promise is a long way away. The review will be updated if something actually changes.  Take a peek inside the newly opened [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/thecabinetofcuriosities/discussions/0/2272575584124463561/][b]Cabinet of Curiosities[/b][/url] if you like to walk off the beaten path and only sometimes return to the main roads.

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30168383][b]Follow the Average Achievement Hunter Curator for reviews and useful information on Steam achievements[/b][/url]: One achievement is almost impossible since there is no gold drop scaling with expedition levels, ""Pick up 400 million gold with one character"". In 90 hours, I managed to get ""Pick up 1 million gold"". That's a loooot of hours the developers intended for you to play this game. There's three achievements for getting to level 30, 60 and 90 without dying. Since the experience gain flutters out like a candle in the wind past 70, getting to 90 without dying might prove a slight problem. The others are pretty much self explanatory and no real problem. One is bugged (at least it still was when I got it in 1.0.9, there's been a few patches since), Princely Patronage, it popped when I only built one building, not all three required for the achievement."
64199029,english,0,424370,"As I said before, I came back after the Arise Patch for a rework of my review. So this was updated at 9/11/2021:  I did a whole new campaign playthrough as a summoner character. I finished the campaign at level 38, played 5 random dungeons after that, but since my previous progress was saved, there was no reason to keep grinding for the irrelevant city-building mode of the endgame. So I played about 10 hours in the new patch.  Summary: it still looks decent. The controll for range characters are ok, but please don't play melee, it's a mess.   Now that almost all technical hurdles have been solved, the real problems of the game come to light. There is still no motivating item system. I hated it when any red items were dropped (legendary), because I always knew that they didn't contain any character development or interesting properties. I only found 11 uniques in my 82 hours and since I picked up every single one I can say that they are all full of interesting to read but completely incomprehensible properties and I didn't find a single unique that made me stronger. That's why the uniques lie unused in the box. Even after more than 80 hours I usually can't tell from the itemstats if this one makes me better or not. There are simply too many incomprehensible properties and virtually no development through the items.  For whom is Wolcen in this state suitable? For people who love ARPGs but have already tasted everything else? No, because a new saison of Diablo 3 or a new character in Diablo 2 are simply much more fun. Diablo 3 plays several scales better, especially for melee characters, and Diablo 2 has such an iconic item system that every unique drop creates a moment of joy. Ergo, I can't think of a target audience.  Is it still possible to make Wolcen a success? From a developer's point of view, I think so, since they now have a reasonably stable technical base. But since the developers don't publish a roadmap, that shows that they have understood the real problems, I don't see enough insight here. Maybe you should buy the game to finance a 2nd part which will take care of the problems of the 1st part right from the beginning.  Yes I will comeback after the next content patch release for an updated review."

180612086,english,0,424370,"Wolcen is a mess of a game. I recently picked it up after they announced Online Play was being shuttered. As such, this review treats Wolcen as a singleplayer experience.   Wolcen has a solid foundation. It has decent moment-to-moment gameplay with satisfying combat and movement and decent character progression. The skill tree has an interesting ""rotation"" mechanic, allowing you to rearrange it to suit your needs. Your active skills have modifiers to their behavior that can be freely switched at any time, similar to Diablo 3's skill system. This opens the doors for lots of experimentation and varied behavior in skills. Gear crafting was almost cool, but the complete lack of transparency made it more frustrating to use. Voice acting made the admittedly cliche story much more engaging. The post-game has a cool ""city-builder"" gameplay loop, but it doesn't feel fully fleshed out.  The progression system's negatives begin to show themselves in the endgame. Many mechanics like multiple projectiles don't work properly, pets are an after thought, a loot filter is sorely needed, and leveling past 70 is a snooze without using cheats. Most stats are ""score based"" in their design, meaning they become less effective at higher level zones to artificially increase the difficulty by making your character weaker. Your crit/resistances/dodge rate/ailment application all get less effective the more you progress, bricking builds that rely on them. Enemy resistances also scale this way, with no way to shred them, which makes life leech less and less effective as you progress. You also cannot swap weapon sets, or save loadouts for skills/transmogrification, which would have been a great QoL addition.  There's a lot holding back Wolcen technically. The final cutscene of the game fails to load, skipping you to the credits. The UI doesn't always behave, where you can't pick up items or select certain UI elements, sometimes locking you in a menu. Animations are rough around the edges. The difficulty of the campaign needed to be cranked up a ton. It just got boring quickly even on max difficulty, despite the scenarios and maps being fairly well done.   For most people, I don't recommend picking up Wolcen. If you're morbidly curious, or starved for ARPG content, it's good value when discounted under $10."
134648264,english,0,424370,"The new company that took over from the old one had a great chance to create some momentum for themselves & the game. Finally completing the story mode after 3 years is not something to be taken lightly, especially after inheriting the original devs' mess.  Several years of dev ignorance & being passed onto a new team, Wolcen had the opportunity to give us something to play for some time before Diablo 4 launches. They had opportunity after opportunity to blow us away. They still have not.  Everything bad I remember from Wolcen launch version is still all I see in Wolcen 2023. I started fresh with a new Offline toon - deleted the one I hadn't touched since February 2020 - and nothing has changed, nothing has improved.  The general consensus is that the latest patch that includes the elusive Chapter 4 somehow made the game even worse than it already was. Existing bugs still exist, and they've managed to create more new ones. In short: it's an absolute disaster. But I wanted to see it for myself.  I stuck with Offline mode because I recall the online servers being a complete mess, and people are still reporting game-breaking bugs left and right today. No thanks. Not that Offline mode is much better. When you imagine playing offline, you think of zero lag and much faster response time because you're no longer subject to online ping. Right?  WRONG! The godawful input lag of about half-a-second I remember from February 2020 is STILL present after 3 years. Spell casting is still slow and sluggish regardless of your increased attack speed, and general movement is still like walking through thick mud. Optimization is still the sheets.  Then you have STILL the amateur mistake of a fully uncovered zone map. It completely ruins your sense of Exploration AND wastes your time by almost forcing you to walk around in circles, because you can't tell if you haven't been to a certain map location before. And if you're the type of gamer who likes to explore every inch of the map to see what you can find & use as you level up, it's a HUGE problem.  And then, everything I hated about Wolcen launch version still present in Wolcen 2023: ITEMIZATION.  Nothing is worth farming, every item in the game is a BORING stat-stick with not a single interesting affix to speak of. Skill damage increases over time the more you use it, and you tweak it further with various nodes you unlock during the skill levelling process. And that's all in regard to skill customization.  What the different versions of Wolcen team always fails to grasp is: In games like this Loot-hunting is half the fun, finding exciting new items and affixes that potentially alter your personal play-style and increase the Fun factor. Take that away, and you lose half the fun, because gear choices hardly matter.  Furthermore, it completely kills Replayability. There's nothing worth farming, so you have no reason to keep playing. You complete the story mode once and then you toss the game in the trash, which is exactly what I did 3 years ago when I completed the incomplete story. And what I just did once again, for good.  Thankfully I bought the game for 20 bucks when it was still called Umbra and it was during its alpha phase, when it had the most potential with its rotating camera view & awesome unique elemental staff attacks - both of which were removed from the game in the transition to Beta & mediocrity. I feel sorry for those who paid full price for this, especially long before today.  I feel even more sorry for all the early Kickstarter backers who were promised open-world exploration, a fantastic character creator, in-game housing, and lots of other great features. None of which survived the transition to Beta & the live game. Basically, we got RIPPED OFF.  Such a damn shame, tons of potential. Looks fantastic, great skill graphics, gorgeous level design & crisp textures, all Wolcen needed is a dev team with a clue. So many years later, still fresh out of that."

131169611,english,0,424370,"The last patch still didn't solve some of the worst bugs that have been around since launch.  Inventory disappearing, equipped items vanishing, absolutely terrible performance on end level maps, especially onslaught.  At least the game still receives patches but the devs seem more interested in balancing and level curve instead of game stability and game breaking bugs.  Which at this point is not a good prioritisation."
81633347,english,0,424370,"Like many, I will begin by saying I really didn't want to put this as a negative review. I picked it up at the later end of the beta, beat the beta with a friend, and decided that the game had potential. Well, it surely did.  So, my first impressions of the game were that the graphics were good, animations were a bit clunky or stiff, but the gameplay was decent. At a core it combines elements from Torchlight (damage types apply effects), Diablo 3 (arcade feel, modifiable abilities, numerous questionable design choices), and Path of Exile (Gate of Fates is the same massive unlocked stat tree, classless, abilities are functionally similar), slapped with an original stat system that worked like many other ARPGs out there. I had no real problems with some of this, but did it improve over time? No.  Upon release there were mass server issues, which basically meant the game was unplayable online. This wouldn't be a problem if the game allowed transfer of characters between offline/online. It doesn't. Never has, likely never will. I understood both of these issues to a degree, since the game exploded in popularity. I won't count that against the game, as it the problem was resolved in a time that I would consider acceptable. Still, there was a lot of negative stigma that came with this. As for characters, it's an anti-cheat measure. To be honest, I don't care for it. Grim Dawn has become my favorite ARPG by far, and my favorite game overall. I can play with my friends whenever I want, and offline whenever I want. And if I go into a pub game, I can accept someone may have item edited something in. But if I see it, I can leave. If you're hosting, you can just boot ""cheaters."" This annoys me since I have to play with an online character if I ever want to do multiplayer, and boom, I get a server in Ohio and have to deal with 79 ping 24/7. Not too high, but high enough to be noticeable. Are people going to be annoyed if this was allowed? Yes. Am I inconvenienced and annoyed? Yes. So either way, there's no real winning for the devs.  So I kept playing once everything was fixed, and proceeded to the endgame. There's no new game+, but there is Champion of Stormfall, which is a 3 stage dungeon crawler mode with the option to roll modifiers. Upgrade a city with massive amounts of resources and craft. Pretty basic, but this is where the game has (had, perhaps, since the game was just updated) massive balancing issues. I began to climb the rungs of the ladder into higher and higher levels, noting that gear level was dropping at monster levels rather than mine. This might matter in other games, but here, loot just became bland and mindless. The better majority became useless, and soon I found item level was essentially pointless. All that mattered were item modifiers, and good luck rolling what you wanted. Crafting materials followed a Path of Exile styled re-rolling system, but with even more RNG involved. Slotted gems were supposed to guarantee attributes of that gem type, but eventually I found that even that didn't matter. But after finding a red shield with good rolls, gear and dying also became irrelevant. Mechanically speaking, the game before Bloodtrail was beyond busted in terms of balance. I'll go more into detail about that below comparing the game then to now, but I quit once I reached the last possible level tier before coming close to max level.  So I reached about 90 hours, and that was when I quit. I looked back at the game, and began to think. I had built a character full tank (100% investment in the toughness attribute, all red in Gate of Fates), and was able to do enough damage to lag the game. I looked into what others had said, and why the game was mixed. Bugs were without a doubt the foremost issue. I can't offer anything there, because until Bloodtrail, I hardly experienced any, and as such, I will not speak on it unless it happened to me. So what were my problems, besides the loot above?   Abilities and damage were just years apart from each other. There's one thing for an ability being good, but enemy scaling in this game was dreadful. Bosses obtained millions and millions of HP, on top of modifiers. In the end game, I feel everything came down to Mark of Impurity. When a monster died, it had an option to detonate for damage based on its HP. The mark also had an option to spread on death- and this is where the ability was disgusting on anything. A tank could use a dagger to unlock the ability, throw on Juggernaut, and detonate whole late game waves and bosses in one combo. With enemies at level 170~ and a level 60-70 character, a boss could be one shot by pulling any 5 minions into the area, marking one, and then killing it when the boss was close. Has this been addressed? Yes. Mark of Impurity now deals weapon damage. But after running through the game with everything globally re-adjusted, everything just felt bland. After consecutive nerfs to ailment damage, mark, shifts to Gate of Fates, playing through the game again just felt bland. I tried doing a lifesteal dual wield build, and to cobble together something from it, but values are just incomprehensibly low now. Investing one point in agility gives 0.1% attack and casting speed, with 10 attribute points per level. So it went from one extreme to the other, where one everything was just too explosive and sometimes satisfying, to changes feeling so minute that the difference between Bleeding Edge (a rotating axe spell) and Wrath of Baapheth (Kratos style advancing chain blades) was ""do you want to walk forward and deal 250 damage, or stay still and deal 240 damage?"" This just dulled down the overall feel and made nothing feel like it mattered. Leveled up? 4% more HP and 0.5% global lifesteal as a major node.   This is already a wall of text near the limit, so here's a cut down summary:  The devs reacted a bit late to this problem, and Bloodtrail wasn't the solution. They tried, but the game was just in a mediocre spot. They released a massive balance patch, but it didn't change the basic issues the game has. There an essay I could write on strange decisions (the tough enemy modifier, crit scaling down with player level), but all of that's wasted. I was patient, and I wanted to like this game after it was patched. So I watch for an update, and then here it comes. Bloodtrail. I hoped for a new act for the story, but hey, a revamp of almost all stats in game, player and enemy. And behold, one whole playthrough and I don't feel like playing anymore. What was Bloodtrail, really? A Path of Exile league. OId characters became legacy, and new ones were needed to play it. For me, it even added more bugs as the final boss decided to leap into the void twice in his second stage, forcing me to quit to the main menu and reload. And new crashes for no apparent reason, along with glorious audio bugs that basically muted the game. I beat it deathless in my second run, and I'm done waiting for fixes. It's time to watch Last Epoch, and hope it doesn't turn into this.  I know this is a lot of negativity, but I will admit, the game doesn't feel like it was hollow like some assembly line cast metal piece. It felt like it had some heart put into it. So if a dev ever reads this, I want them to know that you did make something interesting. Even if the animations feel like those Chinese YouTube mobile game ads (sorry), the writing may feel it a bit cheesy at times, the art style was good. Enemies were well done, and each faction was visually distinct. Sound design was fine, and environments were pleasing most of the time. This was far from a dumpster fire, and there's people out there that still like your game. They might still get hate like they did before, but it's far from deserved.   This game's just not worth it, and it's not heading where it ought to be, and so I'm heading to other options."
66716231,english,1,424370,"I wanted to take my time before publishing a review of this game. It is now April 5, we are multiple patches in, and I have a lvl 78 character who is working on their last upgrade for the endgame city. I love ARPGs and play almost all of them to their endgame.  TLDR: Fun combat, great visuals, nice campaign, but a shallow endgame means this title does not have the longevity you might expect from the genre. Lots of potential, but it hasn't achieved its best yet.   Bugs: I have only encountered a few bugs in the game. Nothing I encountered was game breaking. I see lots of people struggling with issues on the forums and reddit, but by some small miracle I've avoided most (except those that impact talents and skills).  Combat: This game is slower and more deliberate than POE or D3. I find that combat is heavy. This leads to well designed boss fights that I found exciting and interesting. The addition of a stamina bar for dodging (complete with i-frames) is welcome to the genre. It allows mechanics to be designed with this resource/skill in mind. It is not your typical run and gun ARPG as both POE and Diablo have become. Combat has a weight and rhythm to it that you do not often see in an ARPG. I loved this change of pace, but this is just my preference. Further into endgame you can develop into a faster clearing build, but bosses still take effort.   Graphics: Beautiful. This game puts all other ARPGs to shame visually. I love the style, the atmosphere, and the levels. I like that skills are apparent without being overbearing (like POE). I always know what is happening on the screen.   Story: I can't believe I am saying this, but the game has a pretty decent campaign. ARPGs aren't known for their plot, but Wolcen does this very well. I think the game is worth the price for the campaign alone. I really enjoyed my run through the game and I took my time. I felt invested in the story which is antithetical to ARPGs.    Bosses: This is personal preference, but I love the bosses in this game. It reminds me of early Diablo 3 where the boss fights were mechanics driven and took a long time to complete. Act bosses are standouts. Endgame bosses are fairly repetitive.  Skills and Talents: This game has more depth than Diablo 3, but is much simpler than POE. Skills level up, get stronger, and unlock talent points to put into skill modifiers. This allows skills to morph like in POE, but in a more streamlined and easy to grasp fashion. Unfortunately, there are not many viable builds out there at the time of this writing. However, the groundwork is there for a deep skill system.  The talent tree is POE lite. There is a skill tree similar to POE, but each tier of skills can rotate to allow more customization. This is an awesome feature, yet not many builds are late game viable and the potential of this character system is not reached.   End Game: Here is where the game suffers most. End game shows glimmers of brilliance. I love the city building, but it will be too much of a grind for most. The end game functions similar to D3 rifting, but with the ability to use POE style map modifiers. Neat set up, but pushing endgame content to get to the top tier of loot can take a long time. This isn't bad, but it will likely feel like a grind. I can understand how people can get bored with end game in its current state. The lack of terrain, monsters, and bosses adds to the grind. In short, I enjoy the combat so much that it didn't bother me, but this is strictly preference.  Loot: The game has failed in this department, which will hurt it in the long run. Most great end game items are crafted through a POE lite crafting system. Materials are rare and spamming them is required for good items. Uniques are not interesting, most loot is purely vendor trash, and my best items I created myself. Without great loot to chase, the end game will lose its appeal long term. Trading doesn't exist so the economy just doesn't matter. This needs to be addressed to give the game longevity.    Overall: Wolcen is a very pretty ARPG. The combat is different from other ARPGs enough to be worth a play through. The campaign is great and the bosses are interesting. End game is lacking at the moment, so you won't sink thousands of hours into this game. There is so much potential here and pre-COVID-19 I thought the team was getting into a rhythm of patching out bugs/tweaking things. It has slowed down since mid-March, but that is to be expected with the current climate. The team did a great job with the game, but it is not a polished AAA title. It has rough spots, struggles with build diversity, and lacks a motivating end game. The systems have great roots and I expect this game to grow into a great game in the future. Right now, play the campaign and anything you get out of end game is gravy."
72772316,english,1,424370,"[h3]Two words my friend: (no, not [i]""No refunds!""[/i]) [i]""Growing Pains""[/i].[/h3]  Yup, that's the essence of what Wolcen was, and actually still is. It was born in pains and even now, after years of development it still crawls in pain. Unbalanced, unfinished, incomplete. Passives working randomly or not working at all, content missing, various bugs still present: from bad positioning (loot drops under surface) to hits not conecting opponents and so on.  Ok, now you are probably thinking [i]""Dude mistakenly pressed 'I recommend' instead of 'I don't recommend'""[/i]. No, my friend - it's not a mistake. I really do recommend Wolcen. Why? Didn't all those faults spoil my fun? No, they didn't. In fact I am having a hell lot of fun.  I don't know why but I really like this game. Perhaps it's because of its visual side? Wolcen is one of the prettiest action RPGs on the market. It's physics gives you the feeling that your character is really connected to the world and not just hanging hovering in space. Sceneries are beautiful, lots of various characters, mobs and so on. Everything made with a high detail polish. Character customisation for instance - is of the greatest: lots of armor parts in dozens of variations ready to put almost any color combination you want (different paints drop as loot).  Hack and Slash is about two things for me - combat and loot. Wolcen offers a great combat - especially magic. Spells are just awesome. Their power, animations and effects - game gives you the best in it's genre.  Then what about the loot? It's right there. Perhaps not a variety like in other H&S but it's good. Wolcen focuses on rare and legendary item builds (think of it like blues and purples from WOW or Borderlands, the difference lies in number of its abilities). There are also uniques but these are a bit different. They are not a build openers like in Path of Exile where you create a whole build around one item. Here they have their unique abilities but in fact they are just a nice addition to the game, nothing ground breaking. There are no set items at present in Wolcen and I think it's good. Why? Two reasons. 1st - I don't like being limited in selection of abilities offered by set items (after all it's my choice what to use, right?). 2nd - Sets feel very 'final' to me. When you finally complete one, some emptiness comes and you start to think ""Well, so it's done"".  As I have mentioned before, the content is still incomplete. Right now the main campaign fits in 3 acts and they are quite long. At the time I'm writting these words we're pending the next big content patch (hopefully) that is supposed to add next chapter to the game and various optimisation fixes. Personaly I can't wait to it.   In the meantime there is the end game and it's content is not so shabby (compared to other games). In Wolcen it comes in two forms: Mandates and Expeditions. The first one is just a single mission, a random map with a simple task (usualy to kill a number of opponents) that is rewarded with an item, some experience points and gold. Expeditions are more complex. They offer you a fixable level of difficult resulting in better loot drops and amount of experience and gold reward.  There is one more thing in the end game - a micromanagement of the town. You can raise new buildings and they will open new features and enhance character options. Resource that is used for buidling is called Productivity and comes from doing Mandates and Expeditions. It's a nice addition to the game but nothing extraordinary (rather a gold sink and a grind machine for completionists).  Current Metacritic score for Wolcen is something around 60% but most of the bad reviews focuses on technicals - weak optimisation, various bugs resulting in crashes, freezes, poor performance etc. I know that from my own experience, I've also struggled with crashes, memory leaks and so on but in the end I kept coming back to Wolcen. It has this indefinable fun factor that adds ""Just one more map/level/mission!"" thing. Game isn't flawless, actually it has few strong downsides but.. I still like it."
63730788,english,0,424370,"I'm not going to sit here and bore you with the server issues there's plenty of review stressing this.   unfortunately alot of the review tend to skip alot of core gameplay issues that  needs to be addressed , my review is going to touch on a few things that ruins the experince of this game for me personally.  1. Balance issues * so to start i want to touch on the stats balance. first off i can safely say ferocity and toughness is just flat out better in every way. leveling wisdom for ailment status chance is okay but it feel more efficent to just stack ferocity and ignore that stat all together. agilty is extremely weak with only giving attack speed. the attack speed you get tends to be underwhelming considering vast majortiy of your damage is coming from skills and makes usign a right click build (in most cases) feel clunky and not worth it at all.  *class balance feels really bad. SPELL CASTING class set ups feels extremly weak (in part with the way wisdom work in this game) the class as a whole does not scale very well at and the spells available simply just isn't that good.   Melee Rouge feels very weak as well. the amount of point you need to put into agility for your dagger to be useful is way to many and hoestly never truly feels useful. You take ton of damage which forces you to pour points into toughness and in turn take points away from agility making the agility stat just that more useless.   Warrior class is very much overtuned and more specifically Bleeding Edge is the only skill you need to plow the story and currently my late game my level 60 is still strong enough to walk thru level 70+ enemies.  it seems the devs has put alot of work into the melee warrior build with most skills feeling good to some extent unlike a good portion of rouge/spellcaster skills.    2. Skills and UI issues and game clunkiness  * I want to start off by saying that this isn't the case for every skills but for quite a few the skills simple just doesn't work. go into your game now and use sovereign shout with the modifier that stuns and try using it. IT DOESN'T FUNCTION at all (at least for me as of 02/18/2020). I'm sure you can find many more skills like this that has this issue. * Tool tips is another issue. quite a few simply do not give you enough/lacking information.  A skill that comes to mind is Duskshroud when you add the Friendly territoy ( it adds a curse effect to the skill) modifier to the skill it tells you the duration, the chance and the stack but it doesn't tell you what the curse actually do. As a new player you wouldn't know what it does without looking over reddit or a friend. * Unresponsive skills/Hotkeys. i've died a mountian of times in this game simply because my potion hotkey ( Q Key by default) doesn't respond or respond late. in some extreme cases i died with full health. only after i died the potion went off and i was down. only happen once so far but still this shows how unresponsive it is. I find myself clicking skills 3-4 times before they trigger which makes playing the game very frustrating. * Lucky for me i haven't ran into it but charaters being deleted is a issue my friends has run into. I don't know if this has been patched or fixed but just know that this exist quite commonly.   In Conclusion, i personally can't justify spending 40 dollars on this game in its current state. 19.99-24.99 maybe or if you just want to support the company. otherwise the game is sadly a buggy mess that in my opinion would be a decent beta released title, not a full release title.  so as of (02/18/2020) this game in a no for me."
111059876,english,0,424370,"I played this game at launch (2020) and it had some good ideas, but unfortunately it was plagued by bugs. Fast forward to 2022, I gave this game another shot and while some areas improved, unfortunately the game still seem to be a mess.  The graphics is probably one of the best in the ARPG genre, but gameplay wise its lagging behind a lot of the competetiors (Path of Exile, Last Epoch, Grim Dawn, Lost Ark just to name a few). Overall only buy this game if you know what you getting into, otherwise I would suggest to play the other main ARPGs."
132986006,english,1,424370,"If you re not looking for endgame content that'll last forever then, yes, Wolcen is a really nice experience from its start to the end of its current storyline.  The content is still minimal, so this is not a game you can get lost sinking 1,000's of hours in right now. However it's definitely fun, the combat system offers what the other aRPG's do not.  The developers keep breaking their promises and keep going into silent mode; except for a monthly post that often doesn't bring anything really concrete on the table but empty promises.  So if you end up buying the game I'd suggest you to get it during one of its sales."
42030496,english,1,424370,"I read the reviews and I particularly gave attention to the negative ones. It almost made me not purchase and experience the game, fortunately I did and I’m enjoying this game more than my experience with other ARPG so far.. I’m loving the graphics and also the bright environment which I think is one of the factors why I prefer this than other ARPG particularly PoE. looking forward for the multiplayer update!"
189462141,english,0,424370,"Ultimately, I can't recommend Wolcen.  In its current state, the game is as finished as it's going to get, bugs and half-baked storyline and all.  There's a history here: My understanding is that this game was, at launch, a buggy mess. A very *pretty* buggy mess, but still a mess. The devs made a lot of promises while overestimating the scope of the work to create and fix the game.  The released a final patch and then cut and run.  They posted a final update in Maty 2024 indicating the shutdown of multiplayer.  This may not be a direct scam, but it's a close as you get the classic Early Access tale of a developer not following through.  The current state of the game is playable. The story is very engaging, but fizzles out near the end (guessing because they ran out of money) so you get a sudden ""six months later"" epilogue (which is the endgame) in one of the most pivotal moments of the final act.  Combat, mechanics, are okay. Not amazing, I would say feels pretty clunky by PoE2 or D4 standards.  If you can get it for $4 and want to play single-player, that's probably worth your time, but right now the most valuable piece of this product is as a cautionary tale and a ""Remember Wolcen?"" among ARPG fans."
100843543,english,1,424370,"I purchased Wolcen when it was still Early Released and i refunded it.   Fast forwarded to now when the game was already in full launched, I decided to give it a go one more time. Honestly because I was bored waiting for other ARpg since I just finished everything else in my list.   I must say it's been fun journey to finished the solo campaign.   The good thing about Wolcen is they give you the feeling of being kickass. Think of it as Dynasty Warrior (if you ever play one) but in Diablo II format.  Sure it won't be as depth as Grim Dawn or Diablo II. But I still think it is fun to play.   Personally I think this game deserve a little bit more positive rating. After Diablo II and Grim Dawn set the bar so high, I understand why players want only the best since they gonna invested hours in it. But I feel like Wolcen is build for something slightly different, be it intentional or not. It is type of ARpg that you can just start, play for half an hour and exit. Fast pace and action is what I think the main attraction here.   Now I know people compare it a lot to PoE and LE. But I do feel Wolcen stand on its own.   The perfect ARpg might not exist. Diablo II is one of my favorite but obviously I could find a thing or two that might be improved, in my own opinion. With Wolcen, I think they should go with pre-determined class instead of open options (you'll know what I mean if you try the game) but that doesn't mean its a deal breaker for me. It just the route the Developer take and to be honest it is nice to see breath of fresh air of stats other than the traditional strength, dexterity, physical, and magic. I think most of people have complaints because they asked for something groundbreaking and fresh but cry foul when it doesn't suit their expectation.  If I may draw a comparison, this game might be better than Torchlight III (given how much I love Torchlight II) and that is something. At the very least you will feel the battle more ""engaging"" as I am short of words to describe it. I found this especially true with melee character. Every hit connect with enemy feels badass. Even compare to Diablo II Ressurected (which is not apple to apple considering how old the mechanics of D2R already). Can I suspect the player that doesn't like this game is mostly ranged or magic type of character ? Because with Wolcen I always ended up playing melee regardless my initial intention. It just feels more satisfying.   All in all, at the very least you can enjoy the graphic. Sure the game crashed sometimes. During my many hours of run, I crashed 3 times. But luckyly no equipment are lost and believed me it was fine. I honestly experienced more crash with D2R with less hours of gameplay. Luckly none of equipment is lost on both games otherwise it would have been a deal breaker.   Will I invested all of my time to play Wolcen compare to other ARpg ? Highly unlikely. I know I will come back to D2R or GD if there is nothing new and I just want to be nostalgic. But to play Wolcen one run after real life work at the end of the day is really fun. Imagine it as playing relaxing game after hours of Dark Souls (what am I talking about, obviously some of you find Dark Souls relaxing).   Oh I forgot to mentioned you can customize your own character and equipment is detailed visually. You can equip different glove of the left and right hand. As well as different set of shoulder protection. My only complaint is that why not make all the way into shoes as well so that shoes doesn't have to come in pair anymore ? But seriously, some items are just imbalance, at least in my experience. You get lots and lots of weapons, armor, shoes, etc etc but i feel i don't get enough sash. Sometimes i think i am stuck with my equipment from the start until several acts in the future before i found the better replacement. But maybe that just me.   The visual of the character is pretty much like Warhammer 40k. So if you like Warhammer 40k homage, then you'll settle just right on. I definitely have no complaint on it. I just wish we get to have two handed gun, like riffle or something because we got handgun and bow&arrow while some enemy have sniper rifle on them. Now why is that ? And also, why not put crossbow as well ?   Overall, I recommended the game. Full disclosure, I got it on discount. I think it's worth it."
61347017,english,1,424370,"I have recently purchased the game. Haven't finished the 1st act yet but even now I am very happy with the game.   Graphics looks great although is the least important thing in games (imho). The game itself is very dynamic and although I don't have newest PC (i5  3.5GHz, 8GB Ram, GF 970) I have constantly 60fps.  I like skill tree which is similar to Path Of Exile one...although easier to manipulate and diverse your path. I very much like how you level spells and chose what modifications (increased damage, area, cooldown etc it should have) It let you modify it more to match your playing style.   The story is interesting although as I have mentioned I haven't finished whole 1st act yet it is very promising.   I love the idea of building own house...yes not the most important thing in Hack n Slash but I love the idea. It gives another reason to go and drop stuff  (and it reminds me good old Ultima Online).  There is no trading yet but I hope it will be implemented.  Only disadvantage I see is description of items...at least at the beginning.  There is no info about whether weapon is 1 or 2 handed which may be confusing a bit at first. Rating of items works differently to how I thought it should- sometimes 3 star item has worse stats than 2 star item. I found some information somewhere that it is not to compare items but to say how good rolls of stat on item are...not sure here really). Stats of items could be clearer.  There are small bits that needs fixing but overall I would highly recommend the game. Can't wait for the release day."
172231670,english,0,424370,They're shutting down the multiplayer functionality of the game instead of giving enough of a damn to give one last update for the game to run peer-to-peer or through some other method that doesn't require them hosting the servers themselves.  Don't make your multiplayer portion of your game entirely reliant on your own hosted servers if you don't know if you can host them indefinitely; it's practically worse than planned obsolescence.
90317210,english,1,424370,"Summery:  The game is absolutely playable and fun. I had 2 crashes within 120 hours of gameplay and a few minor bugs which didn’t bother me at all. It's an absolutely awesome looking and sounding ARPG with almost no limitations regarding character builds. I would totally recommend the game at its current state and price for all ARPG, H&S and RPG lovers.   Hint for Newcomers: Don’t give too much attention to the bad reviews. Most of them were disappointed bakers from the kickstarter project “Umbra”. Which is justifiable because they didn’t get what they payed for. But Wolcen is NOW a good looking completely fun ARPG. Don’t get confused by the two campaigns. Just use “Blood Trail”. It’s the same as the “Lords of Mayhem” campaign but without the bugs and including the improvements of the Blood Trail patch and the following patches. The “Lords of Mayhem” campaign is meant for old “legacy” characters only.  Hint for those who want to come back: Delete all characters which you had before the “Blood Trail” patch was released. Start from scratch with the “Blood Trail” campaign and enjoy. Since I did this: (almost) no issues during 120 hours of gameplay.  Pros: -	Dynamic gameplay -	Awesome graphics -	perfect sounds and sound design regarding positioning and quality -	no class limitations -	lots of skill variation possibilities -	well sized skill tree (wheel) -	almost infinite endgame -	the first real fireball I saw in an ARPG which is actually useful in the endgame ^^  Cons: -	linear level design -	not challenging except the boss fights -       the apocalyptic form is almost useless -	Endgame: o	becomes boring  by the time and there is no specific threat or super boss o	Not enough players for a random multiplayer session atm o	Repetitive expeditions/seats"
74096451,english,1,424370,"Overall a quite decent game with really nice graphics but not near complete with some minor to major bugs, alas I have faith that WOLCEN Studio will not disappoint in the long run. Do keep in mind that it will take some time for the Developers to finish and polish this game so if you're impatient then put the purchase on ice for now.   *I MAINLY PLAYED OFFLINE*"
63390281,english,1,424370,"I was dissappointed in my purchase of Wolcen in early access almost 2 years ago. But after setting it down and forgetting about it for a good long while, suddenly i was seeing videos pop up on youtube about all of the great changes happening to Wolcen and so I gave it another try.. Wow, have they come a long ways. I haven't had this much fun in an ARPG in a good long while, and now, a day before release and having seen all of the stuff they have planned for endgame, and moving forwards is outstanding.   The gameplay is the best part for me. The attacks feel ""weighty"" and very satisfying to use. I love the hybrid system that they have in place where I can use any combination of spells, physical attacks, ranged, attacks, etc to tailor my ""willpower dumping, rage generating, rage dumping, willpower generating"" cycling of gameplay. And that was the reason why i had so much fun leveling to 20. Whenever i found a new spell or powerful new weapon, I wasn't limited to the ""Class"" i had chosen or the playstyle i had used up till that point. I could very easily pivot and incorporate this new skill or item into my gameplay and completely switch things up. This kept things fun, fresh and interesting, and I can't wait to play the full game tomorrow :D  If you liked anything about the diablo franchise, torchlight, Path of Exile, titans quest, etc etc, definitely go watch some videos on Wolcen and give it a try. I can only speak for myself, but I have spent more hours in the Diablo games than any other (World of warcraft doesnt count, haha), and I absolutely loved my time in the beta.   Hope this helps, and good luck on your leveling journey to those of you who have already purchased the game :D"
46690896,english,1,424370,"i'm not exaggrating, this is the new diablo, wolcen take off where diablo 2 left off, not because of similarity, but because it is so damn satisfying to play this, AND the upcoming beta stuff is incredible, it will revamp the game quite noicely.  Why is this thing so good?  Everything in Wolcen is simply too fun to use, even the normal left click attacks are well made, and they have different combinations, like; pistol and sword, that's right you can actually do that, you can even get an upgrade called 'Titan' on the skill line and equip two-handed weapons as if they were one handed(yay! like in d2 barbar!), so you can use a two-handed giantass axe with a pistol like a steampunk knight it all looks so damn fine.  The glorious cryengine makes everything even better.  Entire thing looks so beautiful.  Wolcen is also super ambitious, currently it is officially known as singleplayer but the multi is in tech_beta which you can opt-in for it in the settings and try it with your friends, it obviously has bugs time to time but overall it's very promising.  Speaking of Tech_Beta, it is only for testing, it has limited gameplay, but, even with limited game the reworked spells, how they look, better looking weapons, bigger axes and stuff it all just looks so awesome..  Wolcen has a great future, and i genuinely think it will be the next Diablo 2. And in my opinion it is a great honor that many people think of wolcen as good as diablo 2 was.   Edit: Well, this aged poorly."
63755684,english,0,424370,"I really wanted to recommend this one, I really did... I had a blast with it the first couple hours, experimenting with build ideas, finding new spells, and abilities, and was even getting into the mediocre story... Then shortly after Chapter 2 started the entire game fell apart.  I want to start by saying that this game has potential, and I do like it, and I would tell you buy it in a heart beat if you're reading this months after release, and you know they have fixed the problems. I'm gonna start out with the good.  THE GOOD: - Amazing Doom/Warhammer/Diablo art style, and theme. - The most refreshing take on character skills/talents in an ARPG, or better yet RPG i've seen in a while. - Unique, and thought out spells/abilities - Limitless potential for builds. There's literally room here for anything you can think of. - Feels like the first next gen arpg on the market. (for what is actually done.) - If this studio pulls their shit together Wolcen will give the big boy arpgs a run for their money.  Now lets get into what is unacceptable about this game, and why I wont be recommending, or playing it until things change...  THE BAD:  - This game has an absolutely unacceptable amount of game breaking bugs for it to be considered a full release let alone a 40$ one. This is 1st/2nd year early access level.  -  I can't make it through a single stage without getting stuck on the floor defenseless, or without the audio cutting out. The enemies are either one punch chumps, or bullet sponges from hell.   - The difficulty ""curve"" is more like a roller coaster. One minute thinking you have a decent build to the next wanting to respec, but not being able to due to the extremely low drop rate of the currency you need to respec while leveling. I get wanting end game respec to be expensive, but while leveling the rates should be WAY lower. A skill/talent system this big takes time to get used to, and find a viable build. You should be able to fix mistakes without feeling like you are being stopped by a paywall that doesn't actually exist.  - The entire game is severely unbalanced. I've seen some builds literally go god mode on this game while others make completing the game literally impossible, and with the insane cost to respec, you better hope you do your homework, or you'll be grinding before you're half way through the story. This also isn't just due to imbalance either...   - A serious chunk of the passives just don't work period, and this doesn't help the fact that there's virtually no information in the game about what each stat does there really is no way to take chances, which I think defeats the purpose of a game like this.  - If you do play, and end up making it to the end of the first chapter, and getting your angel/mech suit thing, don't pick the reaper/chaos one, because it doesn't work. I spent an hour in the chapel/holdout stage shortly after getting it watching my character jump around the screen while that horrible computer crashing audio skip blasted my ears, only the finally be stuck casting a spell for another 2 minutes, only to be dropped dead on the floor.   - There are some awful UI bugs as well. Items being dragged under the gem window, or not being able to directly drag armor from the gem vendor window back to yourself without having to drop it in your bag first, having to click a few times here, a few times there to get the ui to respond, Oh and on Ultrawide resolutions seeing editor lighting/animation cuts off the side of the cut scenes.    All in all the 15 1/2 hours I spent with this game felt like I was working QA, or playing a new early access game. Just didn't feel like it was even to a beta stage. Late alpha at best. This would be fine if this is what the studio was selling, but it isn't. This awful habit the industry has picked up has got to stop, and it doesn't matter if it's the big AAA studios, or the underdog. I don't care if you're a small studio, or not. It's a outright deceptive practice. If development didn't go as planned, and you have backers to satisfy then do the right thing, and take the hit. Release it as an early access, make some in game goodies for the loyal fans, and release it when it's ready.  Regardless of all of that I really do hope I can come back, and change this review, and I hope the devs apologize for this launch instead of just blaming the ""server load"". That's obviously an issue, but that seems to be the patsy in this case. It seems to be more of a coding nightmare/lack of QA that is really the cause of this games issues right now."
132944580,english,1,424370,"I had this game on my wish list since it came out , but after the it came out the reception wasn't great so I didn't buy it. Over the years the game got lots of updates and it was on sale multiple times but due to mixed reviews I never pulled the trigger until it was £7.70 and at that point I though if its crap I won't even mind, but I can tell you all that is not the case. I don't know when the game got to the state it is now but I don't think there has been a better time to play it, I put 50 hours into the game before I wrote this review mostly because a lot of people are still complaining and I just don't know why? This isn't a game that you will play for the rest of your life, the campaign was a little too short I can agree with that but apparently more is to come this year and the Champion of Stormfall mode will keep you busy for a good while and its miles better that silly rifts like you get in Diablo III , to me this is one of the better ARPG's I've ever played , it actually took me away from playing Diablo II Resurrected which is not an easy thing :P all in all get it especially when the priced at £15 - £20 , you will get your moneys worth especially if you get into the Champion of Stormfall Mode :-)"
129647782,english,1,424370,"Review after finishing chapter 3 on Offline mode: If you are after a isometric action rpg with tons of loot and skills, you will enjoy this. I had a bloody fantastic time playing the game. I finished the main campaign after around 38 hours. Apart from rewarding game play it comes with excellent production values including the music, voice acting, great sound effects and graphics. (The story is even okay with a nice bit of dark drama in the 3rd chapter). I had absolutely no bugs at all during my time. The game was, gratefully, on the easier side for me, though some bosses (especially the end boss) were set at a hard, though not frustrating, level.  Especially good were the ""hunts"" side quests where you make decisions along the way whether to make rare drop rates increase at the expense of making the enemies harder. They were fun. The game has suffered a lot of early criticism and negativity, I suspect mainly from early players (who suffered with a lot of bugs) and recent players who are heavily into the game+ where maybe things such as drops and skills are causing concerns. I don't know about that yet as I am only going to play game+ for a short while and wait for the final campaign chapter to be released, so I can replay the whole game again (yes it's that good). However if you are happy to play 40 hours of really great action rpg (yes I will say it..... ""Diablo like"") then this game will not disappoint. EDIT; After playing a few hours of the game+ (Stormfall) I am just realising that there is still a ton of game to be played. You are sent on missions that help you restore Stormfell and these missions also get voice acting and new areas to play.  Bosses are now really something to contend with and you will be rethinking your character all over. I love it. There is just so much content here to still be played.  This game definitely deserves more positive reviews than the mixed review status it currently has.  Further edit: Well my review remains completely positive after finishing the chapter IV content. I have now around 100 hours in the game. The final chapter was different in presentation as compared to the first 3 but still enjoyable. The content was less a campaign and more like a series of missions. But it all concluded the story well and I was not disappointed. The cinematic scenes were top quality. You basically just got more of the core gameplay so if you were happy with that so far you will enjoy this. I still have the end game to continue with and I am still motivated enough to continue for the foreseeable future. This game is a solid 8/10 BUT.... it must be played offline. Online is a complete disaster."
88610662,english,1,424370,"I wanted to play this game since release but waited because of the bad state of the game at release.  I'd been wondering when would be the right time to buy it because despite this, in context they ran out of money for their kickstarter.  Far more important to me though was that someone finally made an ARPG which isn't trying to be a straight Diablo or POE clone.  To me, innovation and willingness to be different is huge, especially in what I think is a stale genre which is ready to evolve.  First and foremost, if you're deciding whether to play this game, my advice is to set your expectations as if this were a brand new game for where the content and polish currently is.  Forget that it came out over a year ago now.  It's a very, very fun game IMO, but think of it as a fresh new game that needs time to grow out still.  I've also only been playing single player offline so far.  So...where is it now?  This is the question and the review I'd wanted to read before I bought but couldn't find.  It's hard to read past all the negativity and complaining about the game still.  The great: The action and gameplay in this game feel INCREDIBLE.  This is the biggest thing for me.  I sadly have not been able to get in to POE despite its popularity and vast amount of content because the game just does not feel good to me.  Wolcen feels almost like a hybrid of a brawler and an ARPG.  The hits have weight, weapons have different swings that you actually need to take in to account when using them.  Simply fighting with your regular weapon swings is fun, where as most APRGs it feels like you click enemies to death and ability spam.  I thought the campaign, story, and characters were *very* well written and I'm honestly surprised.  I actually cared about the characters and where the story was going.  The stats, itemization, and skill tree feel like a work in progress but are currently in a very playable and fun state still.  This is another area where I personally am giving it a ton of bonus points because, again, they have opted to not run your boring standard ARPG stat system.  At every level this game is trying to make it so that theoretically every stat can work with any class archetype you choose, and there are not nearly as many arbitrary limits on what gear or skills you can use.  The game pretty much lets you wear and equip whatever you want, the only limitation is whether you can make it work, and the game tries very hard to give you the most flexibility possible in how you accomplish that.  It is so nice to play a game where necessarily intelligence/wisdom = magic, agile = rogue/ranged, etc........even the skill trees themselves offer something for everyone in the majority of cases.  The graphical quality, art style, and animations are superb.  THE BAD, as I see it: -The worst thing for me is that the tooltips are very poorly worded and there are too many unexplained mechanics.  It's kind of bizarre actually, considering how good the writing is for everything else in the game.  It makes it harder to know what you're getting when theorycrafting or comparing items and skills -Everyone writes about bugs with this game.  I played through the campaign two full times and have been doing their endgame mode here for a while.  It's only crashed to desktop twice for me, and once I had to restart the game because it was acting wonky.  Twice I got a weird graphical bug that meant I had to quit to main menu and load again.  That's it. -*I haven't tried it myself yet* but everything I hear is that there are still some game disrupting bugs when playing MP, and at this time there is no matchmaking.    Conclusion: I love this game.  I hope Diablo 4 takes some notes from this game.  I do not say this lightly.  Part of the reason I'd waited on this game, aside from bugs, is that I was afraid that development would freeze or worse the studio would go under.  Instead, they've started posting development updates talking about upcoming content.  They promised regular patches starting in 2021 and thus far have delivered.  They even were able to hire a couple of extra people to work on the game!  I'm not ready to pause on the game yet but I see myself coming back to this game every time there is new content."
64265366,english,1,424370,"I was (and still am hesitant) to write a review for such a controversial game, but, probably 3 people will ever read this, so here goes...  Caveats: Never played an ARPG before. Saw the hype, took a chance on a genre I have no prior experience with.  PLAY OFFLINE:  I hit up offline first without much thought. I had a great gaming experience all the way up and into end game content. Really enjoyed it.  ONLINE: About 9 days after I bought this thing, I decided to try the online mode. Once there, I started to see why all the negative reviews are popping up. This dev team isn't ready for online, is my guess. I got in after a game update or two, so I missed the worst of it. Had some bugs that blocked progress coming into ACT 3, managed to work around them. That said, they shouldn't have been there in the first place.   So IF... this game looks appealing to you, and you like to play alone, buy it, and run offline mode. You will have a blast. Online is better than at release, but I can't see the future, You are on your own if online play is a requirement for you."
140910444,english,1,424370,"So I really like the GFX, the skills, the enemies, the combat. The voice overs are great, campaign is actually a good story - cut scenes are real nice. I haven't played long yet but i come here as a Veteran D2 Player, D3, D4, POE, Etc.  What I like about Wolcen is that it launched as a terrible failure 3 years ago but the team didn't give up. They have been working diligently for free since then. In an age where goliath companies like Blizzard produce over-priced garbage, i believe in the under-dog studio. Wolcen's team is trying REALLY hard to continuously improve this game with free updates and patches. I think if we stick around this will eventually be a top ARPG - it has all the right stuff to reach that level."
49815946,english,0,424370,"I want this game to succeed, but so far that is just not happening. (Please understand before assuming I'm just crapping on the game, I have a lot of time invested into it on several accounts to assist with testing things pretty heavily.)  For those that just want a short answer; I cannot recommend this game currently.  I helped Kickstart this game back when it was still named Umbra. The vision of the game back then was such a different scope than what we have gotten to now, and not in a good way. The developers honestly became extremely lazy mid-development and just decided to start copying every other ARPG on the market rather than stick to their own style and promises. There are so many aspects to why this game is failing currently even though they have now rushed a beta together to try and save-face.   1. The developers pretty much completely ignore the community.  From the start, they had a website/forums where the initial place to report bugs and give feedback was. This started out ok for the first few months of development but slowly you could watch the forum become abandoned by the developers and team of the game. Massive bugs, exploits, glaring issues etc. all started going completely ignored. When I confronted the lead developer about this, he told me ""we don't really bother with the forums anymore, we use the Steam community instead"". Yes, he literally said that. No announcement or anything on the official site, or even just closing it down, they just let people shout into the void with their bug reports and feedback all of which was completely ignored still to this day. (There are massive bugs in this game that to this day still exist that are reported on the original forums.)  Soon after, they started doing the same with the Steam forums, becoming less and less active and less engaged in the community. And again, it turned into a new place to be, Discord. Where they hardly ever talk, and never listen to the feedback.  2. They abandoned their own game in favor of copying other ARPGs.  During the alpha, the game was focused on being a unique experience for an ARPG while still having the traditional aspects you come to expect in one. This was going pretty solid for a while, we got fairly regular updates with some various new features to check out. However, this suddenly changed when massive changes happened in the team where people were fired/laid off to a point where there was only like 2 people left on the team. We got very little information about what was going on and we got a new update that basically broke the entire game for a while.  They shifted focus on their original ideas at this point to basically just stay afloat. The original alpha act 1 was scrapped and was replaced with a very lacking piece of content. Then some new hires were added and more promises began rolling in.   Fast forward to a few months ago, they completely ditched the entire game. They gave up on their own concepts and ideas, and instead completely copied Diablo 3, in almost every possible aspect. They redid everything, but used all of Diablo's ideas instead of being original and having their own game. You logged into this new alpha and were presented with a new title screen copied exactly from Diablo. The entire game mode available at this point was Diablo inspired. Skills, graphics, animations, loot, etc. were all redone to be more like existing ARPGs. The entire skill tree system was disabled in favor of a 'revamp' which turned into a clone of PoE with very minimal unique parts. New mobs were added that were literal copies of Diablo mobs (models look exactly like D3 things (ie the Butcher), the mob skills were clones of things from Diablo, etc.)  3. Massive game breaking bugs still exist, to this day.  There are a lot of massive bugs in this game that have been there since day one. These bugs have been reported multiple times across all mediums (official forums, official bug reporting setup, official Steam community and the official Discord) all of which just got ignored or simply deemed 'unfixable'.   There is a huge bug due to how the world loads because the developers do not understand how to properly handle thread synchronization. This game loads various aspects of the world during a loading screen in different threads. All fine and great for optimization, however they have no locking or syncing mechanisms in place to deal with the order things complete or when the game assumes it's ready. This means there is chance every single time you hit a loading screen that you will fall through the floor.   Here is a quote from one of the developers from a pm I had with on Discord. This was me reiterating the issue of falling through the floors in the game. (This convo was back at the beginning of the year when they released the Diablo 3 clone version of the alpha.)  ""There might be, CryEngine have a worker thread system to run some things away from the main thread. But tbh, we'r a small team and we'r making such an ambitious game (ARPG are hard..... so many game mechanics & systems... it's great and horrible at the same time as a programmer ^^) that I don't think we'll have time to take a look into this before release""  I'm not trying to out a developer or have any ill-will towards them, but this is a huge problem that wasn't new. It's been in the game from the start and is still there now. You can also cause this bug to happen in other ways by running against walls and other jagged surfaces that are blocking like walls. Eventually you will start to slowly fall into the floor, causing the camera to go absolutely insane while moving. Soon enough you'll fall through the floor or your position will never correct itself until you restart the game.  There are other massive bugs like this in the game too. Such as loot drops falling through the floor or landing up in unreachable places. Potions not reacting properly on the current 'tick' of the game, causing you to die because it'll trigger the cooldown but not heal you until the next tick and so on. This are massive glaring problems in an ARPG that are not going to fly when a lot more people start playing and finding the same problems.  ---  I really want this game to succeed. We need more ARPGs to exist and help continue to push the genre forward, but right now Wolcen is not that special thing it once was when they first announced it.   Right now, it feels more like a beta test of an unannounced Diablo 3 clone made by fans.   I do not recommend this game for the time being. I highly recommend people save their money until the Wolcen team really gets back into their own grove and starts making their own game.   To the developer I talked with, I'm sure you'll see my name and recognize me based on our in depth chat. I mean no ill-will towards you or the team. I want this game to be amazing. But for me, your current direction is not one I feel is going to make this game popular or successful outside of a small niche of people. Please take a step back and realize copying Diablo is not how to make a successful ARPG."
78320072,english,0,424370,"This game is a gross far cry of what was originally sold to backers during the Kickstarter. Originally touted as going to be an open world role-playing game with an isometric view, quests out in the world, exploration, and more. A diablo version of Skyrim. Instead we got a buggy b-rate version of Diablo with an edgy story and art that looks like a tryhard-Chinese version of the Warhammer aesthetic. Absolutely embarrassing."
64256373,english,1,424370,"There were definitely some annoying bugs on release, most all of them have been fixed (at least the one I personally encountered) but beyond that its a really fun next gen ARPG."
66703156,english,0,424370,"Wolcen is like a dish that's made with an excellent recipe using the finest ingredients.  The problem is that the dish was taken out of the oven way too soon. Most of the customers left the restaurant after being served a half baked mush and the confused chefs don't know if it's too late to put the food back into the oven.  [h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1] - Gorgeous visuals and decent animations - Environments are detailed, however could use more map variety - Servicable voice acting - Fun combat system - Dynamic class system, which allows your char to respec into anything and change your playtyle while in the city. - Certain skills are a lot of fun. - Story is alright up to Act II.  [h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1] - Act III is horrible - The game is unfinished - No real end content: Item and monster go up to 187 but you pretty much do the same once you beat the story. - End game dungeon modifiers are ridiculously unbalanced: some of them are too easy, while some of them make a run close to unbeatable  - Certain passive skills don't work as intended, and some of them just straight out don't work"
84692086,english,1,424370,"For months I've wanted to buy Wolcen and have put it off because of the negative reviews and general opinion online that it is a buggy mess. I bit the bullet during the winter sale and so far I have been absolutely blown away. It is everything I was looking for in terms of a new ARPG. The combat feels great and the visuals are pretty. The progression systems strike kind of a balance between Diablo 3 and Path of Exile. The abilities are simplified and accessible but there is an expansive passive skill tree for tailoring your build.  In terms of bugs I've gotten some occasional texture pop-in and glitched audio, but everything has been very minor. So far I haven't experienced any of the game breaking issues that other people have reported, but I'll edit my review if I do later. Either way I've already got my money's worth from this game and I would gladly recommend it to other ARPG fans."
63434878,english,1,424370,"I'm a dad, in my 30's now and don't have much time dedicated to gaming. So when I pick a game, I feel I have to choose it wisely. I'm very very glad I purchased this one. First steam review I've ever done. One of my favorites is Grim Dawn. This is now equal to that and I've only played the first couple of hours.   The graphics, diversity of spells, spell graphics (important to me) and the way the combat feels/looks is just perfect. Really great job, devs. I'm gonna spend a ton of my free time on this one!  EDIT: You absolutely should not purchase this game as of 2.19.2020.  It's important to know that this game is not in a playable/enjoyable state at the moment. My initial review was based on open beta game play after 3 hours. Once launched, the game was quickly taken offline for 3 days due to unexpected database issues due to a massive influx of new players. There are so many bugs that many consider game breaking and it's flat not worth $40.   Bugs that you will encounter as of this review: Loot/Stash disappearing, Item/gold duplication, unable to basic attack certain mobs, end game monsters not dropping any loot, damage modifiers not actually modifying any damage, potential for complete character wipe and completely bricking your game open completing final act boss.   *Before you purchase, please go to the /r/Wolcen subreddit on Reddit and look up the current state of the game. You've been warned. Come back a year from now and I'm sure the game will be great."
57229570,english,1,424370,"[i] DISCLAIMER [/i]: I backed this game back in 2015, played here and there during it's changes, I liked some of the changes and didn't like others. This game is much different in 2019 than it was then, and most of the negative reviews are based on that. As you can see I'm approaching 200hrs played in early access, and I might just hit that mark before release because of how enjoyable I have found the game, especially the recent patches. I'll layout my pros and cons for what is currently available and then my optimism for what is coming.  [h1] Pros [/h1] -[u] Visceral action: [/u] This is an ARPG, and you want to feel the impact of your skills when killing enemies, and I feel Wolcen does a very good job here. I've mostly been playing melee and ranged builds, haven't really dabbled in magic yet, but the attacking skills are hefty and satisfying. I'll also add that the audio for the skills is great, and I particularly love the ""plug plug plug"" sound of the auto-turrets.  -[u] Itemization: [/u] Loot, loot and more loot! What more can you want from a hack and slash looter? Starting out lvl 1 in the campaign each found item is a treasure, wondering if it's an item that fits into what you are planning to play or you find something that completely alters your plan because it's better or build defining in this classless system. Once you start finding rares and uniques the game really kicks up! But once you start finding legendaries, oh boy do the min-maxing demons come out, and I love em'!!! So far in this iteration of the game these red items, basically rares on steroids, are often best in slot, and the grind to get them is a ton of fun. Anything red that drops on the screen is a potential small to huge upgrade for your character or another build, and then sometimes; but as with any game looter, there's the chance that item just rolled all the wrong affixes and is useless.   -[u] Skills: [/u] I mentioned above how I felt the skills are visceral, and you feel their impact. Here I would just like to mention that I feel the current group of skills we have access to (24 in total) are pretty darn good. The animations and artwork of the skills is great, and I do love the rune system that is in place. For those who are reading this review having not yet played the game, so far each skill lvls up to 20 (same as current level cap) and you have 20 points to allocate between the associated runes for the skill. Some runes cost 4 points (minor) and some cost 8 (major), and this will determine how you use the skill compared to another player using the same skill. It's fun and allows for a lot of build variation.  -[u]Passive Tree: [/u] The Tree has 3 rings (2 at the moment) in the first ring there are your basic ""class archetypes""; soldier, sentinel (rogue) and a mage one (forgot the name). The next ring has 6 ""sub classes"" and these are where you start to get builds being defined. The 6 branches of the second ring are the: Assassin (dodging, single target dmg), Ranger (projectiles and ranged attacks), Elementalist? (elemental damage duh), Cabalist (damage over time oriented), Warmonger (physical damage), alongside the Praetorian (tanky boi). Now the really cool thing about these rings is that they are not stationary, so you aren't stuck going in one path or needing to spend 10 points just to get to your desired 2nd ring, you can rotate the rings to set them up the most efficient way for your build!   -[u] Attributes: [/u] You gain attribute points per lvl that can be put into Ferocity, Toughness, Agility and Wisdom. You will find yourself sometimes doing a little mixing and matching to perhaps hit break points, or your build might only require you to dump all points into one. It's dealer’s choice sometimes and is often very dependent on gear you find and certain passives you may have chosen. Wolcen is finding a nice happy, and functional medium blending attributes, passives and itemization together.   -[u] Campaign [/u]: I found the first act to be rat her enjoyable, and the story to be easy to follow and so far, well thought out. The art and environments are great. Not the open world that the game used to have, but I do not find it detracts from the gameplay that much. Looking forward to Acts 2 and 3 on launch (hope they have a bit more content than Act 1), and the following Acts that are to be FREE DLC.   -[u] Soldier of Fortune and Wrath of Sarisel: [/u] So these are the current endgame content for the game. [b] Soldier of fortune [/b] you get to push higher and higher monster levels with the incentive of increased loot drop quality and quantity. You can add modifiers to these runs to make it more difficult but increase the reward. in SoF loot drops from everything, but you don't get the ""reward"" until you've completed 5 runs.  For [b] Wrath of Sarisel [/b], when making an SoF run, once you add all the modifiers you can lure ""tainted"" monsters that will chase you down and do what they can to kill you. These guys are basically assassins that can really mess you up. These runs are a mix of speed and kill runs, as you want to clear mobs as quickly as possible to kill the bosses so you can get a high rank at the end of the run, I believe that the higher the rank the better the loot (doesn't always seem to be the case). However, these runs offer loot that doesn't drop elsewhere. Loot from these runs can roll affixes like a Bow allowing you to use the melee oriented Bladestorm (Whirlwind). This affix might be cool and interesting, but maybe not useful. But finding a shield or a sword that allows you to use spell casting skills as a melee character can be build RE-defining.   -[u] Social/Trading: [/u] The big thing though is you can trade anything and everything with your friends. Even if you found something while playing solo, you can give that to your buddy who is just starting out. I don't mind a system like this, I prefer it over nothing, or something so limited its frustrating (D3 trading...blech).  [h1] Cons [/h1] -[u] Skills: [/u] some skills I found we very slow to cast, like Arrows Wail, which is hail of arrows type skill, and the casting time for the skill seems a bit long as enemies tend to be able to close the gap during the cast time. This may just be due to my lack of play time with the skill and build style as I've mostly been playing melee builds. So, take that with a grain of salt.   -[u] Lag and Loading: [/u] Right now Wolcen seems to be pretty CPU intensive, generally once in-game it isn't too bad, but sometimes when starting a run or going to the next level it takes too long and some monsters show up and slowly start beating on me to the point I end dying at the start.  -[u] Bugs: [/u] It is early access, there are bug. My review is very long now so go look in the forums for the bugs.   [h1] Future Content: [/h1]  For this I would really suggest going to their website ([url=store.steampowered.com] https://wolcengame.com/ [/url] to see what they have planned as I have gone on quite a bit so far and I would just be copy-pasta-ing everything anyway.  If you like Hack and Slash ARPGs the likes of Diablo, you can find enjoyment here. I'd recommend picking it up if it goes on sale before release (January 2020 if they are still on track!), if it doesn't then maybe just wait until it is released if you don't feel like being limited to lvl 20 (lvl 90 is the cap on release).  Current state, I give this early access version a 7/10. Again, I'm giving this a 7/10 as an early access game. I'm not giving a fully developed and launched game a 7/10 because that is not what that is...sometimes people seriously forget that when reviewing or reading reviews of early access games. I hope to update this on release, and I hope I can give the fully released version of Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem a 7/10 or better!  Thank you for your time, Flyhumpy"

168131604,english,0,424370,I understand abandoning a project. But not allowing your players to enjoy multiplayer? Peer to Peer or releasing a server API. Instead just nothing. Big lol.
172377285,english,1,424370,"I have a little history with Wolcen ,i tried it a few years ago and my computer had some problems,here on steam this is my second experience with this game.   Unfortunately my review comes at a time when developpers announced their plan to end the support for multiplayer and endgame content however there's enough content in the single player campaign and to be honest i was interested only in that. The after grind is not for me and there are better alternatives for that.  If you never heard of this game there are similar games like Path of Exiles or Diablo series,this can be a great choice if you're interested in action rpgs with dungeon crawling and loot-based progression.  I really liked the dark fantasy theme and visually the game is a feast for the eyes and for my surprise the voice acting was great for this kind of game. After some browsing i discovered popular voice actors from games i played before like dragon age or witcher 3.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311461899  In terms of gameplay everything was smooth with no major issues or bugs.. the movement was fluid and the dodge/roll responsive. With a huge arsenal of spells and combinations of talent trees you can create a unique character, featuring a classless system Wolcen doesn't lock you into a specific class !   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311376207  Another mechanic i enjoyed was the Apocalyptic Form, this transforms you into avatars with unique and powerful abilities ,there are multiple avatars you can unlock each with its own theme. Beyond the cool factor and amazing visuals there are strategic advantages during though battles or boss fights.  At this point in time i can only recommend this if you're looking for the single player content, for a great price during a sale of course.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311467285  Pros: - Great story with twists and betrayals - Voice acting  - Visuals  Cons: - If you want more than single player campaign,read the negative reviews  My review score  Story - 9 Gameplay- 8  Graphics- 8 Sound - 9  Overall - 8.5"
63504300,english,0,424370,"Right now the game just feels unpolished and I cant tell if its because of the servers being under strain and things feel laggy or its just the way the game is but combat often feels unresponsive and choppy, attacks dont connect the way you expect them to not to mention the unit collision can make things super frustrating at times.   There is also a problem of skills not giving you enough information about what they actually do and how they scale and all the information given is usually very vague such as ""increases damage dealt by summons"" but it doesnt give you a number and from what I can tell you cant see it in the stats of the summons either. Status ailments are also hard to keep track of since there is no indicator on an enemy telling you what they are afflicted by and how many stacks youve put on them and similar things happen all over the game with things being very obscured and unclear for no real reason.  Last of all is just a personal complaint since I am going for a summoner build but the AI for the summons is ridiculously bad 70% of the time they just sit behind me and do nothing, the charge command for the zombie summons rarely ever work they either get stuck on you, each other, the terrain or on thin air. there is also nothing in the game that tells you if your summons scale of things like youre status ailment chance or if they calculate their own stats separately from yours. You also completely lack any form of indicator of how many summons you currently have so you have to manually keep track of them at all times which feels like a huge step backwards from every other ARPG ive played.   TLDR: I do enjoy the build diversity and experimentation the game offers you but I can not recommend it as it is now because the unresponsive and unreliable combat system holds it back.  Edit: There are alot of really butthurt people commenting on this review deciding to ignore the fact that the game is getting more and more negative reviews by the hour and that the game is not flawless and that alot of the problems are personal opinion and thoughts. Neither am I attacking or discrediting the devs in any way and I know they are working to improve the game but that doesnt mean i will recommend the game until these issues are addressed."
65543844,english,0,424370,"Update: I have re-downloaded the game as of August 7th ([u]after 5 months[/u]) and here are some of the things i noticed.  [b]Bugs, bugs, and more bugs.[/b]  I started a new character to see what has changed.... 1. The server capacity is only at 1k now, so anytime it goes over the limit, the server will shut down.(yes wolcen lost 98% of the player base, so they downgraded their servers to the limit before release.) This is what happens with a bad launch, or releasing a game that was not ready. When will gaming companies learn? First impressions matter and you can't redeem yourself after a bad launch. 2. As i played through the beginning of act one again, there was an audio bug of squishy corpse noises that wouldn't stop playing and it was annoying as hell to the point where i had to go to settings and turn the effects volume off. 3. Things disappeared in the chests. 4. Offline character randomly deleted. 5. I still sometimes get stuck in objects, but not as often as i did before. 6. Playing as a ranged character, the hit boxes are still janky or sometimes it doesn't register. 7. I got stuck in a loading screen for 10 minutes after ACT 1 transitioning to ACT 2. 8. There is still some latency issues here and there, but it definitely was not as bad as before. 9. I wasn't able to test online because i couldn't find anyone online to play with... everyones gone, what do you expect. But last i played the LAG was BAD. 10. While going through act one, sometimes the quests don't register and i got stuck in a map and had to go through the other maps again for the quests to register correctly.  WILL UPDATE AS I PROGRESS FURTHER OR FIND NEW PROBLEMS.  [b]SKILLS AND BALANCE[/b]   Will update when i'm higher level.   [b]Armor and Weapons[/b]  1. Legendaries are still useless... 2. Seems as if armor doesn't make as much of an impact as your passive skill tree.  Will update more as i progress.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This game lost 127k players within the first month of release. That should tell you how terrible the developers are at making decisions. They make decisions to satisfy them and not the player base. They do not listen to feedback and usually deletes them.  If you even look closer, the people who have the top reviews didn't continue playing after they reviewed. Because after the game released, the first patch destroyed the game, the second patch nerfed skills and took ALL players hard earned money away whether you were a cheater or not, (because they couldn't catch who did or did not cheat), which caused mass amount of players to quit since they lost their hours upon hours of grinded money.   The last time i played wolcen was a few weeks ago, ever since they've completely nerfed everything, and haven't balanced the skills, the game has become unplayable. They'll keep nerfing skills people find a good build on to help clear the maps faster.  The game itself was already very grindy if you didn't cheat, but now they've nerfed all skills and made the required materials to upgrade items 2 - 4 times more is just ridiculous.   I just wanted a game where i could enjoy hack and slashing mindlessly and enjoy the loot drops, but rare loot drops are almost non-existent at this point because of the nerfing.   If diablo lets players 1 hit everything and clear through the map fast and enjoy their way of grinding, why can't the developers of Wolcen do it? The answer is, they don't want players to have fun.   The result: they've lost 95% of the player base as of today. You will not find anyone to be able to play with because majority of the people has quit. Personally, I'm not going to go back and waste my time on the game anymore till a year later when they've finally fixed the game.   Wolcen studio, here's an advice: to keep your player base, LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR WISHES. Don't DELETE US AND BAN US FROM DISCORD BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE OUR SUGGESTIONS.  I wouldn't be surprised if their servers are not up anymore in a month or two. Wolcen studio has destroyed themselves and the player base. Do not support them and give them your money. Who ever is making all the decisions in this game should be fucking fired."
70830944,english,0,424370,"Great looking game, great feeling game.  The issue I had is that the game provides you barely any numbers for your spells and abilities.  Descriptions such as ""Your attacks may cause lightning to chain foes""  No proc chance, no damage number for the lightning, just fucking guess.  So I thought, you know what they got a great game here, fun to play, they just gotta fill in some blanks.  Was I dead wrong!!! They are making an expansion!?!?!?!  They didn't even give you fucking spell descriptions yet, and they have the godamned nerve to make an expansion!?  WTF is wrong with these people.  Pro tip, some player love to know what their characters abilities do, we don't need act 4 to this mess, just fix your game please!!!!"
97110792,english,0,424370,"TLDR: Wolcen at this current point in time is still half baked. They have made good progress since launch, but it still has a very long way to go. As of right now, endgame is bugged and the story is not finished yet, and due to this i cannot recommend this game. THIS DOES NOT MEAN, I WANT THE DEVS TO GIVE UP.  I want to love this game. The foundations that the devs have laid are quite solid. Skills are fun to use, changing builds is super easy, the transmog system and dye system is super easy and you can always keep yourself looking good, and the endgame systems they have set up promise a good time.   Thats the problem though, the games foundations are solid, and the ideas are good, but there are too many bugs and issues holding the game back. During my play through (most of which was done co-op with a friend), we experienced a couple of bugs through the story, one of which forced us to replay an entire section (thankfully an earlier section) because his character did not get the completion flag to trigger on his account.  Another bug we encountered that was VERY annoying, was in chapter 3. we were experiencing a really weird bug where our characters and animations were all moving/playing in full speed, but it was as if our characters were getting stuck in the floor and the game was having a hard time trying to figure out where we were, thus forcing us to move in super slow motion, EVEN WHEN NO ENEMIES COULD POSSIBLY BE DEBUFFING US.  Then we have the issues with endgame, currently there is a huge bug where if you are in a mandate OR expedition, sometimes when you open your inventory, skill screen, or passive screen, it boots you out of the mandate/expedition completely and kills the portal, completely resetting your progress. It is completely random WHICH screen does it when it decides to happen, but it happens frequently enough that i have only been able to complete 3 mandates and 2 expeditions.  I have also encountered bugs in expeditions that render the boss immune to all sources of damage, hits simply not registering at all. I know this is a bug, as the boss was not IN a damage immune phase. no numbers were even popping up, yet their model was flashing as though it was getting hit and my internet connection was perfectly fine. (on top of that, i was able to fully recreate the issue in offline mode where internet is a non-issue)  Then we have the story. The story just started to get interesting in chapter 3, annnnnd it ends on a cliffhanger.   Due to all of the issues stated above, i cannot recommend this game to anyone quite yet. I ABSOLUTELY DO ACKNOWLEDGE that the dev team has made progress, good progress, but its not done yet, and i do hope that they continue to improve upon, and expand what they have.  I want this game to succeed, as stated in the beginning, i love all of the ideas they have, its just not ready yet."
67819670,english,0,424370,"I have spent 465 hours on game and I feel like I am in position to let you know if you should buy it or not.  Short answer - Do not buy it!  The lack of communication from these developers is outstanding. We dont know the roadmaps, nor what is being fixed or worked on. They seem to neglect priority of fixing servers completely which are very broken and dsyfunctional for multiplayer experience.  The neglect is very obvious even in their own discord channels which are being polluted by dupers and real $ sellers. And they really dont do anything about it. (And on funny note after helping and twitching for their community they banned me without a reason).  The dupping in wolcen is disaster. To this day nothing has been done. But can you blame dupers not really... The whole crafting system as one friend put it to me, is worse then winning a national lottery. Without dupers selling gears you would never be able to craft perfect or close to perfect gears. The whole crafting system is one massive joke.  The game is alpha state there is very little content to do apart of experimenting with builds and griding level 90. In order to reach level 90 you would need to spend around a year in game, its worse then grinding in MMO.  I could go on but just take a look at bug reporting section or jump on discords and you will see how the game has failed the community and declining very fast.  The only good thing was the story and single player experience till you finish it but its not worth the price they ask, nor your time. Just wait for diablo. These guys made something unique but they executed on it poorly. They dont know how to manage community nor they know how to run servers."
186158338,english,0,424370,Developer couldn't complete this game and abandoned it. Just becasue they released it and called it 1.0 doesnt at all mean it was. Then very shortly after announce another arpg. Took customers money and threw them away. Don't fall for it again.
32153912,english,1,424370,"So....I had originally given this game a poor review but after sinking some more time into it I have begun to really really be excited about it.   Realize that if you get the game now there isnt too much content. That is the one thing I would want to impress on anyone thinking of getting the game now. It is still early access.  ~~~AS OF NOW~~~ ~~~~~THE GOOD~~~~~ I am in love with the skill set of a few of the characters. The POE-like style of the skill tree is fantastic...but unlike POE you dont have to follow a straight line with it. There are very few restrictions in terms of where you can go. Keeping in mind that there are only half of the tree available at this point and a lvl 20 cap I am pretty hyped about what else I can do in the game.  The skill graphics are dazzling. I dont use that word very often but I will in this case. I am really enjoying the way it is all put together and having a ton of fun grinding already.   It seems to be getting updated and patched regularly.   I really think this will give POE and D3 a run for their money and Im happy I found it early on to see how it gets develped over time.   ~~~~~THE NOT SO GOOD~~~~~ Content. I really wish there was more to do in the game. Ive been grinding away at capped level hunting for really mediocre gear (the usual progression of white gear, blue gear, yellow gear) and it seems that yellow gear is as high as its gotten. I suppose this isnt as much a complaint as it is a desire for more.  Bugs. The game crashes for me occasionally and has quite a few random movement bugs. It is a little clunky in a few ways but again...it is early access and is to be somewhat expected at this stage.  ~~~~~IN THE END~~~~~ Would I recommend you get this. Yes. I would not expect a very polished game though. If you want to get into a great game early and see it all come together over time...this is it.  I am really excited to see what becomes of this game and look forward to some sleepless nights~"
63701725,english,0,424370,"passive nodes that don't work, passive nodes that are overtuned, stashes and characters disappearing, and all the server downtime, but what are the devs' top priority?  Banning everyone who duped gold using a bug that was reported YEARS ago.  The attributes nerf coming out of the claimed ""beta"", cause let's face it this game is still in beta, is just one of the many unbelievable things this release botched. Defensives removed, leveling makes you weaker, and adding attributes tops off what you are focusing on (crit, att speed< ailment chance or hp/shield), but weakens the rest? What?  Apparently game is as playable as it was 4-5 years ago, and they spent this time transferring it to another engine and rewriting some code so it fit the engine, and no progress was made in making the game actually work. Then again, this sounds so absurd so do your own research about this if it makes or breaks your purchase.  The game looks fun and plays quite well at the starting stages and despite alot of build whining online you can make any build work all the way to the end of the campaign, because killing bosses is really learning their mechanics more than a dps race  before the reality kicks in that your build is worthless in endgame (yes i played lightning mage and later found out more than half my nodes, mostly the spell damage ones, do not work)  Oh, and did i mention that certain endgame mechanics (i.e the Dark Market) bricks your game?   Story is what you would expect out of an ARPG, something demons/devils, something angels, character is blessed/cursed and is called to action etc etc.  You will have fun for the first few hours, in awe of the graphics and the unique rotating skill tree. If you are willing to spend the game's full price (34 SGD for me) for ""a few hours of fun"", then go for it.   Otherwise, dont even look at this game. I heard Grim Dawn is on sale."
73283758,english,0,424370,"I've Been Tricked, I've Been Backstabbed and I've Been Quite Possibly, Bamboozled!  C'mon WOLCEN Studios, it's 2020, man. You guys know better than to do this to us. We're so hungry for a good ARPG, and to not be able to make this pre-beta game actually full release quality after 5 months post-launch, and AFTER you've already taken our money is an absolute disgrace. ""But we're working hard to fix the bugs!"", yeah, we get it. But that's what closed alpha/ beta tests are for, to get the bugs worked out...instead, we unwittingly paid you a whopping $39.99 to beta test your game. Launches like this, and dodgy attempts at quelling the outrage with empty promises of patches and content really make me miss the good old days of buying a physical game at a store. It was a tangible summation of painstaking hours of coding and testing that was crisp, clean, and very rarely had game-breaking bugs. Developers tested the hell out of their product to deliver something to the gaming population that they were proud of. WOLCEN Studios, what do you have to be proud of with this game?"
64627880,english,0,424370,"So 200+ hours into the game, and  to be honest I hate writing reviews, but I can't keep my frustration at bay any longer. It has all been said before. The game is utterly broken with all the bugs. Some of the bugs I don't mind but for me the crazy frustration are things like backtracking through an entire map just to kill the last rat and then go ALL the way through the entire map to kill the boss. Not a bug, just an insanely hair ripping experience. Did they fix the life regeneration of bosses in 1.08. NO they didn't, welcome to another boss that instantly heal destroying the run. Most of the time when you get one shotted you will have no idea where it comes from, and it will happen often on higher levels unless you are crazy geared, or using some broken skills/exploits. The game is not optimized for dodging and many times you have no chance to avoid the attacks, dying while you panic press the button that suppose to save you. I play offline on a very good gaming rig and yet I die over and over again to retarded programming, it is beyond frustrating. Planning to do a lot of crafting, well not in Wolcen. The crafting materials are the most uncommon items in the game, and even with help from the marked you will chew through your very small stack of materials in mere seconds most likely not getting what you want. I do love the game, because it could have been so good, and yet they choose to put a beta on the marked most likely due to financial reasons, and yes it was a smart decision money wise, because people were hungry for a new hack & slash and bought the unfinished product but it could have been so much better. On one side I hope they will get it all fixed in time, but on the other side I also hope they take the money and retire so I can uninstall this @#@# from my hard drive, especially since I don't have any hair left."
142638044,english,1,424370,"Thoroughly enjoyed this. I was playing this concurrently with Diablo 4 and found myself playing this more. I played as a sorcerer in offline mode and nothing felt like a grind as it does in D4. Combat is fun and the spells have decent variety. I had the most fun with 3 summons and an OP annihilation beam.   You can pause the game unlike D4, which is super handy as i have a toddler running around and i can simply resume where i was without getting killed or logged off. All in all i am satisfied and will replay this. It was an absolute steal for only 10 dollars.  in comparison I paid 150$ for D4 ultimate edition and am mostly disappointed, i should have just watched the cut scenes online and called it a day."

45904456,english,1,424370,"As you may have noticed, this is a very polarizing game. By buying it, you have access to an early version of the game. You want an full-fledged experience right at this moment? Then don't buy it now. You want to support a possibly great game and provide feedback? Then go for it. The devs have taken the risky steps to recreate almost entirely the underlying systems that define the game (every dev dreams of this) and from what I have seen during the (short, technical) beta, it paid out. The game looks sharper, the gameplay way more responsive and this is a very good base to build content on.  Now do I recommend this game? This is clearly too soon to say. Diablo 3 was looking pretty good during beta and see where it is now. There are many game design choices that can kill a game beyond just core gameplay. We have no idea how loot or build dynamics will play out in the endgame, or the amount of content we'll have. And we will probably not know until late in beta or after release.  I'm leaving a positive review (for now) and I urge you to ignore trolls who still don't undertand what Early Access is meant to be. Now to WOLCEN Studio, don't disappoint ;)"
75628623,english,0,424370,"As a primarily ARPG player coming from Grim Dawn and Diablo 3 , I will try to review this game on it's ARPG parameters equivalent.  Graphics : Hand's down the best in any ARPG. Graphics are extremely beautiful. Locations are varied but very linear, similar to Diablo 3.  Core Gameplay : Now , the skills we use in this game are similar to Orbs from Path of Exile (POE) , called Enneracts in this game. This skills have their own modifiers when you level up however some of the modifiers are pretty bland and boring.  Modifiers such as ""Increased damage"" or ""Increased critical hit chance"" adds no variety at all. Such modifiers should come with unique weapons rather than an modifier upgrade itself. Right now the meta is ailment stacking and almost everyone runs this play style for maximum damage.  UI : UI is pretty standard ; however translation and description of skills could be better. It is extremely confusing to know which skill scales with either attack or casting speed.  Combat : Fast and engaging , stylish and satisfying.  Character building and development :  There are no fixed classes so you can play a hybrid of pretty much anything ; This is detrimental to the long term success of the game BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS DEEP AS PATH OF EXILE. There is really no variety in class building / theorycrafting in this game. Veteran ARPG players likes to spend an hour or so to theory craft their builds but this is not possible. Also, if you intend on playing a summoner build , hold off for now because SUMMONS DO NOT SCALE WITH ANY IN-GAME PLAYER GEAR ; there is only 1 unique item which increases their damage and that's about it. The Gates of Fate ( Similar to Path of Exile's Skill Tree) is not expansive enough. Re-spec in this game is really , really cheap so I don't see a point in starting another character.  Storyline : It's the best in any ARPG and the cinematics are top-notch.  Itemization : Itemization is good but can be better, There are no set items in this game. It is pretty much a tried tested and proven Diablo 3 where you insert various gems in your weapon and armor slots. You can however re-roll the type of sockets and rolls on your items with certain end-game materials.  End-game : Copy and pasted from Diablo 3 rift dungeons. , At the end of the dungeon , you get loot and that's about it. Atleast in Diablo 3, you get to upgrade your gems but there isn't any legendary gem socketing in this game. You unlock the ""Champion of Stormfall mode"" , where you send out mercenaries to do missions and the only way to complete the timer is for you to do dungeon runs. So it becomes an insane , insane dungeon farming loop and it's similar to Diablo 3 , POE and Grim Dawn.   Bugs : I did ran into gamebreaking bugs that needed me to restart this game ; this is totally unacceptable as this game has been out for 6 months or so. Bugs included : Unable to move on to the next location and not able to teleport back to town. I experienced one game crash.   Final verdict : 5/10 , get it on sale or discount. This game will be at it's best in another year or so. There is a huge issue within the community regarding some of the features advertised during it's early access and was not implemented during release , and when you consider this game has been in early access for FIVE YEARS , they should have done better. It's a cash and grab in my honest opinion. Wolcen has a long , long way to go if they want to challenge Grim Dawn , POE , Diablo 3 , Torchlight 2 and even Last Epoch. You're better off spending money on Chronicon / Grim Dawn if you love ARPG's."

101719096,english,1,424370,"I avoided this game up until a few weeks ago (when it went on one of its sales) because of the mixed reviews. I was craving an arpg, but felt like I played most of those that I wanted. I noticed the the reviews were still mixed but going up since the release and looked into it more as the devs seemed to be still active and trying to turn the game around. I decided to take the leap, and honestly, I'm glad I did. Although this is definitely not the best arpg I've played, I had a good time playing through the story and currently doing a little end game content. That being said there are definitely some criticisms, but it does appear that the devs are keen on fixing most of the issues I have in future patches. Even with only having a fun time going through the story, I played around 30-40 hours, which alone was good enough to justify the 20 something dollars I paid, although maybe not full price. Here are the list of positives and negatives for me:  Positives: -Best graphics in an arpg so far -Combat is satisfying and and fun -Story I thought was pretty good and kept me interested (people are mad about the ending, but I don't mind the cliff-hanger knowing they plan on adding it later especially when I got a lot out of what was already there) -I like the passive talent trees -I also like that you can customize each skill to fit different builds  Negative: -I wish there were more skills available. I was a little disappointed with the limited selection despite how customizable they are. A part of me was also disappointed that you can basically get all the active skills you will use for the rest of the game really early, as you can just buy them. -Uninteresting gear. I've had a few legendary and unique pieces of armor and weapons so far, but none of them were really that interesting, just better stats than the other gear, with sometimes a small twist on something with the unique armor. I would really like to see this area fleshed out more in future patches. -Although I'm enjoying the end game so far, I can definitely see it getting stale in the near future (particularly with no really interesting gear to ""switch things up"").  Neutral: -I know another gripe of people were glitches in the game. I know this will vary between systems, but I had only 3 glitches that I noticed, one of which was a crash. The other two were minor. It seems like they did a great job cleaning them up, at least from my experience. -Kind of mixed on having the skills completely determined by the weapon. I wanted to make a pally type character only to realize I couldn't use some of the skills I wanted to do (although I did google and find out there is one shield that allows spells with a shield, but it still kind of bugged me). I also had a rogue character that I feel would be perfect with 1 or 2 of the spells, but can't unless I don't duel wield daggers (have to do one dagger with a catalyst in the other hand), which makes it feel like it isn't the rogue anymore.  -No Act 4. Currently, the story leaves you on a cliff-hanger as I mentioned. I don't find it necessarily a bad thing as I it makes me want to stick around to see what happens. That being said I understand people's point that it is a full game and it should have already been in it.  Overall, it was definitely worth the price I paid ($24 I think) (on the fence at full price). It has its issues, but the devs seem active and I hope they truly make this into an even better game."
91562161,english,1,424370,"So, I managed to beat this thing.  I should probably note my perspective on this is perhaps a little unusual, because I NEVER knew of the kickstarter. All I knew going in was the game had a rough launch, but had been getting patches and updates, until I saw it on sale sometime after Bloodtrail came out and though ""Hey, why not?"" So a lot of the controversy around this game I was mostly unaware of.  So coming into this somewhat blind and well after the fact? What's here is not half bad. It's basically Path of Diablo 3, taking clear influences from both games. Like Diablo 3 you've got highly modifiable skills, but a giant passive skill tree like Path of Exile etc.  That said the game manages to put a few of it's own twists on things. The skill tree for example, can have parts of it rotated, Want to use nodes form opposite ends of the tree? No need to use a bunch of skill points to path across, just move the tree a bit so the parts you want are closer together. In fact I'd argue flexibility in character building is this game's greatest strength. most passive skills in this game cover broad categories, think ""any elemental damage"" or ""any physical damage"" rather than ""fireball"" or ""swords"" so for whatever build you've got going, there's probably a few different skills that will work with it, and since skills learn abilities that change their damage type, skills that generally wouldn't fit a build can be MADE to do so. Elemental affliction on a melee fighter? Sure, why not?  The biggest drawbacks I can think of, controversy aside, is the game is short. I beat it in about 15 hours, I was skipping most of the little side dungeons, but really there's not much in the way of side content here. There is an endgame called Champion of Stormfall which looks decently involved, though I haven't dabbled in it much as of this writing.  While the game has a reputation for bugs, I haven't really encountered many in my playthrough. mostly it was texture pop in and maybe some animation issues early on, odd, but nothing show-stopping. The devs HAVE been patching since launch, though people keep saying it's buggy, so I'm not sure if those reviews are simply outdated or if this is a ""it works on my PC""(tm) thing.  Finally i'll note for better or worse this game is VERY edgelord in presentation. It looks like the devs played some Warhammer, saw everyone's massive shoulders and said ""here, hold my beer."" whether that's annoying, awesome or both is up to individual preference.  So... yeah, overall, not bad! I maybe wouldn't say to rush and buy it now because this thing had a rough history and there's plenty of solid looter-rpgs out there without that hanging over its head. but if you don't care about that or are feeling curious? By all means give it a shot, you might be surprised."
131164238,english,0,424370,"Because of the new update I decided to give the game another chance. Turns out it remains incredibly frustrating and I really can't recommend the game to anyone.  First of all, the game lags throughout. Even with a very low ping this is very noticeable. It takes up to five seconds between clicking on the merchant and opening the menu. With a ping of 30.  The lag is also clearly noticeable in combat, especially when using a healing potion. In the HUD, you can clearly see how the empty life bar is filled, then falls back to its original state for a fraction of a second, only to be filled again. It's so much fun when a fatal hit kills you thanks to this lag.  Speaking of death, once you die, you have three respawns. Resurrecting is only allowed for a short period of time and the game always respawns you at your corpse. Once you revive, you are immediately vulnerable to damage again. This can (and will!) lead to you being revived in a poisonous cloud and dying again immediately.  The game has no animation cancelling. Short explanation what animation cancelling means: If you are in an animation (e.g. casting a spell), but then suddenly want to dodge an attack, the spell is canceled and the character dodges. This function does not exist in the game. Meaning  that every animation, no matter how small and unimportant, is played to the end before a new input by the player is accepted. There are constantly situations in battles where the game tells you that you should dodge an attack, but you can't because you're already casting a spell or your character has to finish his walking animation first.  In the end, the game feels extremely laggy and unresponsive.  After almost three years we finally have the last chapter of the story (lol). Of course, at this point I have no idea what it was about and just skipped through the dialogs. I just dont care anymore. So i cant review the story But looks visually nice, like the rest of the game.  The gameplay of the last chapter, however, I can review. And it is a disaster. There is hardly any pure story gameplay compared to the other chapters. Instead, the mechanics of the previous endgame have been reworked to stretch out the gameplay of the last chapter as long as possible. Instead of going from area to area like in the previous chapters (and all other diablo likes games). You now have to research the next story mission on a map. To advance this research you now have to empty random dungeons. Basically the research of new Missions take for example 3  turns, and one dungeons is a turn.  You can accelerate the research and unlock other buffs by other researches, but these also take turns. This was the old endgame and it is obvious this was reworked to rush out the story chapter. If you have finally researched the final boss, you can now research debuffs for the boss. These are enormously expensive (gold and other resources) and are done by the same research mechanic. So you invest a lot of gold and time to weaken the boss, run dungeons, get better gear and try to enjoy the gameplay. But there are two huge problems:  1) At some point, the game forces you to start the fight. You have no other choice. Several battles with different tasks follow. And hopefully you knew exactly which debuffs you were researching. Because: 2) If you die in this battle (because you weakened the wrong attack or a buggy mechanic killed you), all your progress is gone. All buffs and debuffs are deactivated, your gold is gone of course and you are back to square one. Now you have to waste a ton of time again, have to spend hundredthousands of gold again and hope you get him the next time.  Yeah it could be cool rogue lite feature, if the gameplay would be fun. But sadly it isnt. Its frustrating. I gave this game many chances. But the gameplay issues since day one, the chapter 4 mechanic that just an insult and Diablo IV and Path of Exile on the horizon i dont think i will every enjoy this game.  And i didnt even mention the bugs (and there are so many!), the boring gear system, the uninspred skills and the pseudo deep character progression."
60421532,english,1,424370,"Played for more than 12 hours, unlike some others. I have only purchased the game in the last 3 days so I haven't gone through the massive wait also like some others who would be salty about that now. Just like Diablo there is a very toxic community who seem to 'dog' the game and spoil things for others. Maybe that's just the hack n slash community.  Whats awesome, ie what I wish other games had including Diablo that I spent 1000's of hours playing: -Hypnotic wheat animation, I've already spent moments running around in it just for relaxation purposes. -Music that reminds me of Baulders Gate, that I also spent 1000's of hours playing -Leveling like I've never seen before. Some aspects are familiar but then something different. -Skills are just found and can be learnt by any class. -Tumble for everyone. -Voice for all. No more reading. AND did I hear Minsc (Jim Cummings)? I hope I did. -Random Treasure chest spawn locations. Can;t guess where they will be at the moment. So gotta look around. -No limitation on who can wear the armour you find. -STEAM PUNK theme. Love that, time to move forward in time. Why don't sequels do that? start why back when and move forward after a few releases. -Some old familiar mechanics but also some new. about 50/50. Now I am interested but not completely lost. -Loving the varied weapon sound effects. I can it the same thing a few times and get different sounds from my sword.  Now those complaining about the time for release. Kinda reminds me of waiting for Diablo 4 or Linage. This team is a lot smaller. Remember when Diablo 3 came out. People said it was coonie/goonar rubbish but it got patched and patched and worked on. Just like assetto corsa when it came out as well. Patience is key these days. No games come out like Baulders Gate these days that are awesome on release. Makes me thing that waiting 2 years after the release is better when I think about it. Release is more like early access these days.  I hope this review is ok with mentions of other games."

Gave it 1hr and will unfollow this crap.   ___________________________________________________________ I love the genre and see tons of potential in this, but for now there is way too little content to recommend it.  I know its alpha but almost two years in early access you should be able to show a bit more content. 20hrs in I got 3 level 20 chars with good gear and basically just farm for nothing.  My concern is that it been in alpha since 2015 and first ETA said it would go beta in 2016 (from Kickstarter). Even then they stated four years of preperation and all the storyline etc was done.  Open to change the review once I feel that I can recommend the game to others but for now just add it on your follow list."
105779535,english,1,424370,"cool game. visually amazing, worth it if you like games like diablo or path of exile.  Just beware that you have to play this game in offline mode otherwise its pretty much unplayable due to only 25% of your attacks actually hitting and lag walking all over the place, this will probably never be fixed either.  Your progress is also wiped when you switch to offline mode.  So if your reading this it might be best to put it in offline mode right away when you start."
71380132,english,1,424370,"I am torn with rating this game. Its has huge potential but also some severe problems.  Pros: - huge skill tree (you can develop your character just any way you feel like) - Interesting feature to build up your ""city"" to support and aid your hero - awesome graphics (including battle animations)  Cons: - laking endgame content (especially loot: no sets and highest tier items are the worst in game) - not very engaging team of developers (they like to nerf skills and create the most useless unique items possible showing that they dont understand their own game in that respect) - due to the afore-mentioned there is a severe limit on character development possibilities (yes you can chose any skills you like but in actual fact only very few builds really work well)  I will give this a thumb up simply because I hope that the developers will eventually create meaningful set items and fix many of the useless skills.  Dont buy this game yet. Put it on your wishlist and wait for the problems to be solved (and a sale) !"
63860641,english,0,424370,"After playing Wolcen for nearly 50 hours, reaching level 70 and Expedition level 103, I feel that I can finally share my opinion on this game with others.  Wolcen is a beautiful game full of potential, but ultimately unpolished in it's gameplay elements with very little to no originality. it isn't to say no effort was put in this game, but these efforts weren't put where it mattered the most.  Let's begin with the good stuff:  Visuals:  The graphics and environnements are gorgeous. The ship graveyard in the intro is simply amazing. The Spells and Skill visual effects are also very good. The character model are quite decent and the transmog (fashion) system is quite simply what games these days treat as standard. Finally, the enemy models are clear and a quick glance will let you know what you are up against. Zones are also distinct from one another.  Audio:  The audio is good. The music is good while it isn't memorable. The voice acting is solid for the most part. Finally, the sound effects of weapons/skills/spells sound impactful. The gear drop as various cue for different rarity and items type and it is quite clear what drops on the ground based on sound only.   Boss Fight (during the story) :  While heavily inspired by Diablo 3 upon release, the boss fight are multi phased encounters with various mechanics, patterns and overlaps to master. You will most likely die and struggle at some point or another on your first run through each of them. Ressource management is key and mechanic anticipation essential. I had a good vibe of the Inferno d3 level of difficulty (minus the enrage mechanics on all boss) and that was perhaps the best thing d3 did on release.  and now, for the not so good:  Gameplay:  While the gameplay in a Arpg isn't necessarely very deep, in Wolcen it is straight up braindead (outside the boss fight which represent 1% of the game). You spam a main skill and plow through mass of enemies without a second thought. you dodge from time to time and that's about it. Base skill cast speed is ludicrously slow and it is painful to cast a buff that last 5 second and look at a 2 second animation that stop your movement dead in it's track.  While skills are visually nice, very few ends up being fun to use along side one another. you to use 1 of 3 types of skills. A range weapon/dagger allow for rogue skills, a melee weapon allow for melee skills and a staff/catalyst for spells. No real class, no real skill mixing, that's pretty much it. You play what your weapon gives you. Enemies don't get smarter and are basically scaling hp/dmg sponges.  ARPG Grind Loop:  This one is perhaps my biggest dissapointement with this game. There are no meaningful, build defining items in this game. Quite simply all items do, is buff certain stats. The end. You would think unique items (which seemed very interesting at first) would have an impact on build, since they allow sometime the use of other class skills, but no. They don't scale past level 40 (campaign ends at level 40 ish). They are so rare while leveling that you will never use them. you use rare items and the ''legendary'' (rare with 1 or 2 extra stat buff). Max level requirement tops at 60 and the items get stronger (a few extra numbers). They had some good ideas with the end game unlocks, where you unlock feature by starting projects and completing them by playing. Sadly, it doesn't equate to much more than a few features unlocked which barely improve a meaningless, shallow grind, just a tad better.  Identity:  Now this one is sad. This game, while definitely full of passion, doesn't have a strong identity. It's Diablo 3 mixed with Path of Exile. You get a few good bit of both game, without ever getting very deep in what made those other 2 unique. The gear design is very diablo 3-esque (which is just stupid considering how much better d1 and d2 design is), the skill tree is a less developped PoE version, mainly providing number change rather than gameplay change. There is a ascended form (big immortal high cd low duration form) but it's actually useless and clunky about 99% of the game. it feels like a concept that got abandonned near the end of developpement but left in the game because there was so much time investement in the visual design of the system. Ultimately, Wolcen fails to bring any form of authenticity to the ARPG table, which is severly lacking in my opinion.    I will skip over the many gamebreaking bugs of the few days as I think the dev did a decent job at fixing them while probably being under pressure to meet a deadline release date imposed on them by the publisher. Wolcen was a fun experience for a few hours, but I cannot see myself come back to it any time soon. Unfortunate for a game that was 4 years + in production."
71195108,english,0,424370,"Like everyone's saying, this game's just... meh.  It's not special, it's not interesting, and while it's pretty, it's also buggy as heck.  The game truly lost out on what made it so unique during development too, gradually becoming more and more generic and soulless.  This isn't just seeing the past with rose tinted glasses, as it had problems at every stage of development, but back when I bought this game it really did have an innovative skill system where you could do literally anything you wanted to with mixing and matching your abilities.  Now it just has a few distinct weapon classes that determine what skills you can use and the only way to go out of them is to change your weapon or to be lucky enough to get gear that lets you cast something else, because your skills sure won't let you by default.  More importantly, it's just horrendously balanced, with several skills being pointless, and the story really is just... so default and boring that it's painful.  I know ARPGs don't tend to have the best stories in general, but they could have at least tried to keep some of their initial story's concepts.  I'd avoid it for now, honestly.  The first hours seem to suck in new players, but a lot of people end up feeling a hollow experience in the end."
95060401,english,0,424370,"I've read numerous reviews and some of the more recent reviews stated that a lot of bugs had been fixed. I trusted those reviews and honestly have to say that I am very disappointed in this game.  The Pros:  As I first started playing I was liking Wolcen. The graphics are astounding.  The storyline is engaging and drew me in even further. The implementation of skills are unique and don't lock your character into a single playstyle. The soundtrack is nice and the voice acting is superb.  I thought that since the main aspects of this game were well implemented that this had to be good news and that the developers must have learned from their mistakes and finally fixed their broken game.  The Cons:  Offline characters are separate from online characters. You cannot cross over from offline to online or vice versa. Offline is the only true way to play single player.  If you want to play single player while using an online character then you are forced to flag your game as private.  But nobody plays multiplayer in the first because it is a shit fest of lag and skills not doing damage to NPC's.  There are no side quests. You must follow the storyline. The only semblance of side quests are when you enter a sub-area of the static questline and every time the only goal is to kill all the npc's. These 'side quests' are identical in every zone. Every. Single. Time.  The gold collecting pet gets lost and stuck. Several times I had to backtrack to attempt to get it unstuck. If it did not work than I had to restart the game and I ended up losing all progression through that part of the map and was forced to restart from the previous Town Portal/Waypoint.  The monsters and bosses are mindbogglingly simple. There is no threat of dying and if even you were to come close then you just use a health potion and your life meter is instantaneously refilled. Then the health potions are easily refilled as you kill more NPC's. It's really easy to NOT perish.  As a Summoner my army would sometimes just simply stop attacking NPC's. Fortunately/Unfortunately the game is so embarrassingly simple that I was able to solo each encounter and afterwards my army would return to attacking NPC's again. This bug could prove to be fatal if they game had any semblance of difficulty because there are achievements that you can attain for not dying.  When looking at items in your inventory you hover your mouse over them to see the stats, as is with most every ARPG. Yet more than half time when I would open my inventory hovering over items would do nothing and closing and reopening did not fix the issue. I mean all it ended up taking to fix this issue was  to simply click inside the inventory and the hover function would return to normal. Not game-breaking but still very annoying.  There are invisible walls that blocked my path even though the map showed that these areas should be easily navigated.  I can't imagine how many more bugs I would have encountered If I had decided to continue playing. Each of the bugs on their own merit are not game breaking (except for the Summoners army bugging out) but it is the sheer numbers and frequency of recurrence that killed all mediocre enjoyment I had.  edit: Corrected several spelling mistakes. Game is still garbage."
63474438,english,0,424370,"Don't buy the game yet, way too many bugs as it is. I made it all the way until act 3 before the game decided to reset my character's story progress from the beginning. Kept all the gear/levels, but now I have to grind through the story once again.... Feels bad man, especially since the later areas are super repetitive."
68533935,english,1,424370,"This is one of the harder reviews I have ever had to do. Wolcen is a complete mixed bag of emotions, fun gameplay, lack of polish, and frustrating bugs. It's an ARPG, which means at it's very core, I am probably going to like it.  I'm a well traveled dungeon crawler as my first game was Champions of Norrath on PS2. Sacrilege to those that started with the Diablo series, but I simply missed D2 in it's heyday. My favorite ARPG of all time is Diablo 3 with Path of Exile following closely behind. I have well over 700 hours into Diablo 3 with over 300 hours into Path of Exile (my most played Steam game).  I value exciting, visceral combat above all else. The game being nice to look at doesn't hurt either.  This is why I find myself recommending a game that is honestly, a bit of a mess. Wolcen launched with a shit storm similar to Diablo 3's launch. Nobody could log in and bugs went wild. Full disclosure, I had the game on launch and elected to play offline. At the time of this review I am sitting at 35 or so hours of gameplay. ALL of those hours were offline which saved me a ton of headaches.  Wolcen does a lot of things really well. The game is just flat out gorgeous. I have spent a lot of time in the transmog screen perfecting the look of my character. My character in Wolcen looks 10x better than any character I have ever made. In any game. Particle effects are gorgeous. The environments are destructive and look great. This is the pinnacle of graphics in an ARPG.   The combat is really, really good in Wolcen as well. The game manages to have the weight and fluidity of Diablo 3 without being a complete rip off. Diablo 3 combat is structured around using resource gaining abilities to then use resource spending abilities. Wolcen instead goes for a tug of war resource system where you use willpower abilities to transfer into rage abilities and vice versa. It's fun to play with especially when you start getting gear and passive nodes that speed up those transfer times.  Gear in Wolcen is middle of the pack. It's not the stupidly simply itemization of Diablo 3 where you simply look for green arrows and it isn't the extreme complexity of Path of Exile. I feel like Wolcen strikes a solid balance in the middle ground in itemization...which the game tends to do in general.   Nobody plays an ARPG for it's campaign, but I'm happy to report that Wolcen probably has the best campaign out of modern ARPG offerings. It's fairly well written and the voice acting isn't bad either. It's quick and once it's over, you don't have to deal with it again. You stay in endgame mode much like Diablo 3's ""adventure mode."" Perfect.  So that's all the good. What's the bad?   The endgame is lacking right now. It exists, but it's incredibly repetitive. You blast through what are essentially nephalem rifts from Diablo 3 and build upgrades for the main city which gives you certain bonuses like an extra skill slot or higher magic find stats. That's about it. The maps get boring fairly fast and the developers made the poor decision of having the end of the run boss spawn in a static location. When you fill up the kill meter the boss should spawn on top of you like it does in D3. Instead you have to back tread in the instance that you already passed the boss area or fight through meaningless hordes to get to the boss area. It's sloppily done.  The game is a fairly buggy mess as well. As I already mentioned, I played exclusively offline. Which means I avoided probably 90% of the problems. Players that played online reported stash wipes and even entire characters vanishing. These are the kinds of bugs that would cause me to uninstall the game immediately. Thankfully, they never happened to me. Instead I came across crashes, graphical glitching, campaign missions not properly triggering cut scenes, passive nodes that either do not work as intended...or just don't work at all, and chests in impossible to reach locations.  The game just doesn't feel like it is a complete game. Everything just kind of feels half baked. In the end, you have to ask yourself what you are looking for in an ARPG. If you want a game with hundreds and hundreds of hours...this likely isn't it. After 30 plus hours I just didn't have the drive anymore to do another three expeditions. I ultimately went back to Path of Exile. This seems like a non recommendation, but it isn't. I thoroughly enjoyed my 35 hours in a $35 game (I bought it when it was on early access). It's a game with a pretty solid foundation that needs a lot of repair work and added content. Hopefully the devs don't give up on this game because I think this game could be something special this time next year."
83081451,english,0,424370,"Singleplayer experience first playthrough at launch was ok, and quite fun. Even though many talents were not working and a lack of viable builds. End game was boring. Dropped the game.  Online was riddled with bugs I heard, and the fact that 100,000 plus players dropped the game within weeks says it all.  Came back after Blood Trail. Played an online character, bugged campaign within 30-40 mins, could not progress. How the developer still release broken/buggy content is beyond me. Dropped again.  STILL NOT RECOMMENDED."
129787478,english,1,424370,"I completely gave up on this game back when it released in 2020. It has come a long way and game play is much better and frankly, fun. Give it a second look. There is a lot of fun to be had here,"
65699557,english,0,424370,"ARPG, mix of diablo and Path of Exile I would not recommend this game for 2 reasons: 1) Too many critical bugs 2) It's just a simpler version of PoE If you read this in 1+ years and think they PoE is too complex for you, it might be worth trying Wolcen, but look at the patch notes and be sure they have fixed all the crashing bugs before you buy!  The passive skill tree in Wolcen is a simpler version of PoEs but it is too simple. After figuring it out, there is really only a few choises to make, and the rest is given. The active skills work in a similar was too D3s skill runes system, and (opposite of the passives) this works better than D3! The story is nothing spectacular, but it's not bad ether. Good enough for an ARPG.  It feels like a mix of diablo and path of exile, where diablo have the AAA UI and story, and PoE have the gameplay,  Wolcen have more AAA feel than PoE and more gameplay than diablo (or rather, i expect it will have after a few updates)  Bugs bugs and more bugs: It's another title that looks good on paper, but is about 1 year too early for release. The bugs are many, but the game killer bug is that when you play the endgame content, you have to play 3 dungeon levels in a row, but if the game crashes no progress is saved. This means you can play for 1-2 hours and then the game crashes as you turn in for reward and you have wasted 1-2 hours for nothing. If it wasn't for the gamebreaking bugs, i wouls have recommended this game for all players that like ARPG and thing PoE is too complex.  A good first try, but not good enough :)"
50772177,english,0,424370,"The devs seems to still struggle in figuring what they want to do with their game and also can't seem to focus on one thing at time, which has lead to countless delays and the game being redone from scratch twice since the early access started 3 years ago.  It feels like they don't really know what they're doing at all... instead of focusing in completing the core features of the game, like adding new acts and skills, they go around adding random stuff that is totally pointless to bring at the current state of the game... Who the hell cares for a Housing system or an Arena, when the game is STILL under development, our characters don't even have access to the complete passive skill tree, and our characters will get wiped every now and them??? It's like they can't really decide what they want to do with Wolcen at this point, and I wouldn't be surprised if they simply gave up on this game.  If you're looking for a cool ARPG, then I recommend you to look elsewhere, because this game will take forever to be finished at this pace... if it ever gets finished.  Wolcen: Lords of Delay is a more fitting name for your game.  Update:  I just received a warning from one of the developers saying I was being ""disrespectful"" on a forum post where I shared my feedback and disagreement on preventing you to use spells without equipping spell catalists on your character... I heard people getting their feedback posts getting ""shot down"" by developers, but I thought they were being dramatic or even trolling to piss the devs off... that was until it actually happened to me and I got this warning message saying I was being disrespectful in my post.  I advise anyone that is reading this game to stay the hell away from this game, because the devs are either insane, or just don't care for honest feedback from people wanting to help them to make a better game and just wants to be praised for whatever crap they do to their game.  I'm officially done with this game, and I advise people to stay away from it, to avoid stressing yourselves up."
69958089,english,0,424370,"Despite the fact that the game underwent ALOT of reiterations, the final product unfortunatly is no longer what made the game unique in the first place on top of being a technical disaster in many ways.  Wolcen, formerly Umbra initially managed to get quite some attention with a broad skill system on top of the still existing talent wheel system. Though the wheel system in its core concept is still present, most nodes mostly just consist of simple stat bonuses that offer no noticeable benefit. There are a few nodes that actually do something to enhance your playstyle but these are quite rare and should have been added in a big quantity instead.  The ability perk system was another system that used to alter spells to a point where they totally escalate like launching 8 fireballs in a cone instead of now just having a slow missile that's not even great. The game should have embraced that level of craziness instead of being the sterile game that it is now.  Another major OOF is the removal of the open world. Umbra used to be open world so you could travel through the world with few up to no loading screens at all. That is completely gone. It's now a typical isolated area style of game where zones are being split by portal like doors and passages. A shame.  The story is okay'ish. It's not really special as it's basically: bad god wanna invade the world and control everything and (of course) you are the guy who will prevent that. However, also here is a big OOF: the story is not complete. There is a big chunk of content cut from the final part of the game as you can see that Stormfall changes during the final act while it has no context at all and we don't even get to fight the true bad guy of the story. Based on what is left of it inside the game, the best part of it was yet suposed to come but apparently they went out of time and hat to make a choice.  Artwise the game is gorgeous. The environments are beautiful and the music is pretty epic. Nothing to complain about here.  Now to the ugly part - the bugs. The game launched in a partially unplayable state. The multiplayer completely died for days and the singleplayer mode was riddled with bugs in all possible ways. From duplication exploits, over non-functional passives and skills up to losing all story progress for no reason. This went on for days and even today the game still has alot of things to flesh out.  But the true reason why they get my thumbs down... the only true reason: where the heck is the Driller?! (that's a joke btw)"
109249112,english,1,424370,"At launch, this game was not so great -- bugs, server issues, poor balancing, and ultimately an unsatisfying end game progression. But by now (early 2022), the game is everything I want out of an ARPG -- polished, wide variety of interesting skills, intricate yet not PoE-level-complex passive skill tree, fluid and challenging combat, and L O O T. Lewd loot to ogle at. It's almost silly how much time you spend picking up loot and examining it to see if you got something good, and almost every run you do get something that's at least worth chucking in to the crafting system.  There is a lot to do here yet, and I could see myself sinking a few hundred hours in to this yet.  Compared to other ARPGs: -Grim Dawn with expansions has a ton more content. Progression is slower, compared to the almost frenzied pace of finding upgrades in Wolcen. I like the combat and skill systems about equally. -Last Epoch is a long way from done, but shows a lot of promise and could be as good -Diablo 3 set a nicer standard for fluid combat with MMO elements like CC and party buffs and defensive skills becoming important. But the loot system in that game is F tier; this game is leaps and bounds better. -D2R is very grindy and there's no crafting and a very simple skill system. The appeal is mostly in the trade economy and the large player base. -Path of Exile is absurdly grindy. I love the skill system and variety of scenery and content in the endgame, but the pacing of finding gear upgrades gets slow and I lose interest.  If you like ARPG games, I think this is one of the best ones out there right now."
23826474,english,1,424370,"This game looks extremely promising. For an alpha its pretty stable and has actually a lot of content to offer. I really like, that I may explore the world while there are actually no quests to do (the available quest line will take you 1-1,5 hours to complete). There is a quite a lot of different loot to be found, so are skills. You will definitely get a few hours off the alpha at the current state.  So lets take a look at the game. I will concentrate more on the good things because its still an alpha. The first thing you will notice after starting the game is the quality of the graphics. Powered by the cry engine, the game creates really nice environments. The day-night cycle adds a lot of atmosphere. Running around in a pitch black dark forest is quite nasty. The lighting effects are really nice and add a lot of quality, especially to the magic effects.  Looking at the combat mechanics, this game has a nice system with two differents ressources. One of them is umbra and is more the ressource used by spells. The other one being rage which is filled by using certain spells or just by attacking. Both ressource balance each other out, if you use your umbra your rage increases and vice versa. This way you always have the possibility to use skills which is really nice. It also requires you to keep track on your ressources so you know which skills you may use at a certain time. Skills level up when used and may either be upgraded by increasing their power or optimising their cooldown / ressource cost. The character levels up by experience, you get attribute points and passive points when reaching the next level. The passive points allow you to strengthen your character in diffent ways (like your magic or offensive capabilities). The passive system is just your basic +% or +X to crit/something system. It would by more interesting if there would be synergies between the different trees or anything else which expands the system a bit.  I will update my review from time to time to reflect the changes the dev implements. So far the devs put out improvements on a regular basis and at a quite impressive pace. At this moment i can absolutely recommend this game!"
95332098,english,1,424370,"Wolcen is a solid and mostly conventional ARPG, but with some quirks that make it stand by itself. The interesting gameplay angle for me is how skill use is handled. Instead of using a singular resource like Mana to cast skills or spells, as is common in ARPGs since Diablo, there are two connected resources: Willpower and Rage. Using one builds the other. So, depending on the selection of weapons and skills/spells you're using, it's possible to use skills indefinitely (albeit potentially limited by cooldowns).   You won't be popping magic potions to enable you to use skills - rather, you will use one type of attack or skill which drains Willpower to deal damage while building up Rage, and then use another type of attack or skill to discharge that Rage, which frees up Willpower again. This means that you're actively being incentivized by the design of the game to use a good variety of skills and even to cross-class, rather than being rewarded for sticking to one skill tree, focusing only on one or two active skills, and sinking the rest of your points into passives (as some other ARPGs unfortunately fall into). This keeps your skill use varied and keeps combat engaging, by preventing you from falling into the trap of building a ""boring but effective"" character.  Graphically and in terms of audio design the game is great as well, and there's some stand-out voice acting from some of the major characters in the story. The story is suitably epic to keep you engaged in it for at least the first playthrough. Besides the story, if you like your build a lot and want to keep playing it after the story ends, there's a post-story mode which allows you to generate infinite random missions while using the resources you gain from this to build up a base, which in turn improves your ability to generate more interesting missions, find or craft better gear, etc. Personally I prefer to replay the story with a different build entirely than to grind away at the same character endlessly, but the option exists if you want it, which is great.  EDIT: Actually never mind, endgame is pretty fun with my current build, so I'm doing that too.  (Minor aside: most of the higher-tier pauldron designs are completely ridiculous, but you can put glamors on your armor pieces for free, so it's not a major problem.)  A lot of the negative reviews you'll see are about bugs which have been mostly addressed, or disappointment at the way that the development has been handled. Legitimate issues for sure, especially for those who have been following the game since its early development; apparently it was supposed to be an open-world game and became a more conventional Diablo-like as time went on. But I wasn't following the development and most bugs seem to have been addressed by now. If like me you're coming in fresh and don't have specific expectations on how the game should be, but just want a familiar Diablo- or Torchlight- or PoE-like single-player ARPG with a few unique gameplay twists in a fresh setting, Wolcen is a great pick."
61709639,english,1,424370,"Updated for release: Despite some initial (now seemingly resolved) issues with server uptime, stash disappearances, and player progression rollbacks, Wolcen is still an amazingly fun ARPG.  There is still some work that needs to be done to bolster the multiplayer aspects and perhaps polish up the character trees a bit, but overall the foundation they are building upon is rock solid.  Character customization is rare in ARPGs so I welcome it, I love the ability to mix abilities and playstyles, and I even enjoy the story so far which is rare in games of this ilk.    Some players are upset with the challenges the game and team has faced and while their frustration is understandable and I too have been disappointed at times, we have to remember that this is not an enormous team and that it is no small thing to build a game of this quality and studio around it; things will take time.  That's my opinion anyway.    I discovered Wolcen originally in 2018 and loved the concept of it, but unfortunately soon after my initial introduction to the game the team scrapped the build and rebuilt the entire game from the ground up.  There was a significant delay of about a year as the game was developed, which precipitated much of the vitriol you see in some reviews from the community.  Some players felt they were short changed on the original concept of the game, which I can understand, but I personally was willing to give them a second chance.  I'm glad I did.  The game has truly be entirely re-designed and conceptually reworked; it now boasts a steampunk aesthetic, cutscenes, and a more coherent story than before.  Thus far, I've been having an utter blast and praise the developers for taking such a big chance and sticking to their vision even with all the pushback from the community.  Well done; going to play this one extensively!"
60663993,english,1,424370,"Currently at the time of writing, this game is in beta, and it is feeling quite good. Pretty smooth playing and the controls feel good. I've had a few hiccups and bugs, but this is expected and therefore I'm not concerned with it as I can simply just go and post on the Wolcen forums.  I do not know the history of the game or what was sold to people, but as an ARPG, I'm happy.  It is less complex than PoE, and more complex than Diablo 3, which for me is perfect as I cannot deal with the sheer complexity of PoE builds at this time in my life, but wanted something a little bit more than Diablo 3 in terms of build variety.  tldr: the game looks good, it feels good, it has bugs, the devs are working on it, it is overall enjoyable and pretty affordable."
135010202,english,0,424370,"Other reviews have (rightfully) discussed all the bugs, so instead I want to cover the absolute mess that is the over all game design up to and including Act 4.  The marketing tells you skills can be customized with 16 different modifiers each, however almost all of them consist of ""deal 15% more damage"". Most skills don't have any meaningful choices beyond ""Summon one less minion but more damage.""  For a classless game, you're still restricted on what skills you can use by your weapons. Unfortunately there's no main-hand spell weapon, so it's impossible to cast spells with a shield. The weapon restriction is a bigger issue than it might seem since it highlights how few skills there actually are in the game. There are 12 Warrior skills, 13 Rogue skills (Daggers get to use Warrior and some Rogue skills, so they are an exception) and 18 Mage skills, of which 4 are summon-related. Since you can slot 6 skills at a time, there's not much real choice unless you go for a hybrid build.  The rotating passive wheel is a much better idea in practice. It actually heavily restricts freedom since you are still bound by what sections are adjacent and the devs decided that different sections (Warrior, Mage, and Rogue) should never be next to their related sections, so you have to path all over the place just to make a simple Two-Hander build, for instance. And there are so few sections in total that if you want to be a Warrior character and survive early you better build around Block since that's your only option in the second ring. Thankfully pathing is not expensive, but that leads to another problem where you end up with so many passive points that there are no real choices to make in your build, though I guess that's fine because most passive nodes are pretty boring anyways, including the big notable ones.  Speaking of being better in practice, it's amazing the ""Resource Opposition System"" survived Alpha, much less a single proof of concept. Playing a melee character and want to use your sweet shield charge ability to engage enemies? Better hope there's crates nearby to generate Rage, because by default you lose ALL of your Attack resource after combat. The only way around this is to build your passive tree around rushing to a specific 3rd tier node that causes your Rage to regenerate instead of your Willpower. I don't know if I can think of a worse way to handle this, to be honest. If skills are going to be locked behind your weapons, have your weapons decide your ""equilibrium point"". All melee? Rage regenerates and Willpower fades away. Half and half? Have them balance out to 50/50. Even hybrid builds are made super clunky by this since if you don't have the necessary resource and you try to use a skill, your character does nothing. Why don't you auto-attack when out of resources since that generates? Instead, when you need to be teleporting away from danger, you're just standing in middle of it.  Entering Act 4 as someone who never played Wolcen before now is super confusing. The story goes from climax to immediate cliffhanger to your character suddenly showing up at the city from Act I and being VERY concerned about an NPC you met once at the beginning of the game. No explanation for the time gap or even what happened, and apparently no other characters are even worried about whether or not the Big Bad is still roaming around? I get that part of the point of the story is that you are supposed to figure out as a player what happened to your character, but last time you were in the (single) main city, the entire thing was falling apart and it was filled with refugees. Then you get to Act 4 and everything is fine  all of a sudden and no one even mentions what happened to make things better.   Also, the (Act 4) voiced dialogue constantly differs from the on-screen text dialogue, and in three back-to-back conversations seconds apart, a captured enemy was immune to pain so you had to send for a specialist alchemist to get a truth serum, then when you go to send for the guy, instead your only option is for your court alchemists to work on a solution for the spell that is keeping him immune to pain, then after clicking the button to do so, you are told that the alchemists successfully cleared the no-pain-drugs from his system. Which is it? Spell or drugs? In addition, the tutorials for the endgame systems that are introduced in Act 4 clearly haven't been updated since its release, since they tell you to start Infrastructure projects that don't exist and congratulate you on successfully completing a project that wasn't even an option, much less one you did.  While some of the issues are baked into the DNA of the game, many others are either bugs that have existed since launch 3 years ago or design issues that they could solve in a single patch or even caught by a single QA person playing the opening of the brand new act with the sound on and also reading the text.  Ultimately it's clear that the Wolcen devs don't care in the least about their own game, so why should we?  If you're desperate for a new ARPG, it's fine at $10 USD but I wouldn't pay a cent more."

I logged back in and the game didn't save me putting on my new items and they aren't in my inventory. Both rings are gone, my shoes are gone, my weapon is gone and my belt is gone.  I'm fucking done. Uninstall it again. Losing all those items was the last straw of constant bugs and annoyances.  Honestly, I tried. I want to like the game. I really enjoyed the story and the voice acting in many parts of this. The world building was pretty cool and some of the environmental design. However, the game is just always in an unacceptable state and it manages to kill any excitement I have. I was really wanting it to work, but it always feels like it shouldn't have ever left beta. I think there would be less flak for that decision. Devs, I'm sorry. I don't want to be rude or mean, but there's always so much nonsense to deal with each time. I hope things can get sorted out for you lot. I really do.  This was all documented in a private, online game"
137534697,english,1,424370,"7/10 Decent game with very high potential but the team of developers are either not many enough to go up the ladder or they don't care about it anymore.  Pos: * Good RPG elements for a Hack&Slash game with one of the most intriguing and complex skill build i have ever seen in long time  * Weapons and armour easy to combo with preferred skill combination * Good graphics & skills animation * Similarities to Diablo games but not as evolved and tested as Blizzard's. * Keeps you in front of PC. Cons: * Poor storyline * Mediocre voice acting * The game itself seems to be unfinished, unpolished and sometimes unplayable because of the servers/region * Because i couldn't find a way for transmuting gems or combine it, i realised how useless is to keep it in the stash and how a waste of time was arranging it in the hope later i will have the option to make it stronger ones (if i haven't discovered the way to do that but there is an option, then my apologies...) * Very buggy for a game released 2-3 years ago. That was something totally unexpected and unpleasantly surprised * The Multiplayer option is DEAD! Either very long times to connect with someone or not working at all in specific regions. * The loophole involving rising in level for no reason and doing the same thing over and over again, just to get stronger and bigger is so cheeky and ... disgraceful. Probably developers were having a meeting regarding new content release or DLC's and decided to just give as a way to continuing playing the game but without NEW chapters, maps, stories, viable MULTIPLAYER option or something much more exciting. BREADCRUMBS.  Anyway! I believe it's first time in my life when i give a thumbs up or good review to a game which has more cons than pos's and the reason why is simple. I enjoyed playing it for those few 65h aprox and i still reckon it has a lot of potential with a proper team and funding behind.  I'm not a professional gamer or critic, just writing my opinion in a personal way, describing with my own words the experience i had, not trying to be to fuzzy about specific content. Before buying something i read most of the times reviews by amateurs like me as i do not trust nowadays the professional youtuber's or gaming websites for simple reason that they get payed sometimes for those reviews and this have a tendency to influence the decision about rating the game itself. Always trust the ""little people"" as they will have no hidden interest behind their decisions of rating a game in a good or bad way, at least most of them/us.   PS: Thank you for dedicating some of your time reading all this. Hf gl."
45623922,english,1,424370,I just have one thing to say. I've backed this game for a long time and you all have the oppritunity to replace Diablo in the spotlight while they grab for cash.  Do not fck this up. Think about the game from the players POV and it will be gold.
111259378,english,0,424370,"[b]Do not buy, this game is unfinished.[/b]   Chapter 3 of the game ends with a ""To be continued"" and it hasn't been continued yet. Apparently it was released unfinished 2 years ago, with chapters 4 and 5 ""to come"". So far the developer seems to be only adding ""endgame content"" (killing the same monsters on the same maps over and over again without any reason or purpose) to a game that doesn't have an ending. Safe to assume it will stay unfinished. Very sad, since what exists of the story is fun&engaging and the world is cool."
93931359,english,0,424370,"I had high hopes for this game but the game has been ""out"" for over a year and they still haven't fixed obvious bugs like having to click into the right window for the tool tips to display.

50075926,english,0,424370,"UPDATE 14/2/2020:  So where to begin, I've left the old review up as I believe its important to see the behaviour of the developers and mods, and also the treatment of people who backed and funded their game. But here we are and it has actually released... sort of  So as expected its now just 3 acts (not the original promised 5) and the game is much much smaller in scope, no overworld areas at all, not even anything as open as D3 has. Now this in of itself is not a huge deal, I enjoyed aspects of D3 (post ROS) maps don't need to be big seemless affairs like say Grim Dawns, but it is a loss to the original vision of the game (imo)   The builds feel more limited and generic, there are signs everywhere of where they have wholesale stolen ideas (even visuals) from other games and titles, now generally they are done pretty well but it has like zero originality. The visuals feel like Warhammer/40k rip offs mixed elements of Tyranny. The skills and skill system feel like Lost Ark and D3 had a baby (but not as good as either yet)   The targetting is still wonky even after all these years (was an issue in original alpha I presume its related to cryengine not liking isometric games) the jolts in quality can be seen all over the place in terms of a rushed release. Sometimes you'll be happily killing stuff smooth as you like and it all clicks and you'll be like 'hell yeah this is fun' then suddenly your targetting messes up or a hitbox doesn't register or you click on something and it just refused to accept it exists (etc etc) and your ripped out of the moment and just feel annoyed that they have come so close to making something good but haven't... yet  Now for the positive bit, I will hold my hands up it is much better than I expected but then I expected it to be total garbage so take that however you want. I already own the game if I didn't I don't think I'd buy it now based on what currently exists so my thumbs down will remain. BUT if your a diablolike loot game fan there is fun to be had here just expect and unpolished buggy poorly optimised mess... before I go some highlights of awfulness in the current release version  - Character models are horrific ugly and bad - Servers are a joke, expect to attempt multiple times to connect online - And when you do connect expect random weird disconnects at times that just throw you back to the menu without any error message or warning - Expect weird messages like 'Your client timed out' and yet you can still happily play on regardless - I can already see aspects where they are going to insert their grubby cash shop and squeeze the players for money  - Balance is an utter mess both of mobs and player skills to numerous to even detail - Numerous skills simply dont work as intended - Story is so cringe inducing it feels like an emo 16 year old with a penchant for Warhammer fan fiction wrote it - Various bugs that freeze you out of the game, chuck you back to the menu or ctd even in offline mode - As of writing this servers have now been down 3 days with no end in sight due to unforseen issues, my personal theory is a major flaw or bug has been picked up they aren't telling people about cause seriously it does not take this long to roll back a database.  Now none of those are game killers but considering the developers track record of how they deal with issues and criticism yeah if money is an issue I'd hold off on this one till a few months time, its currently unstable and deeply flawed with a bad group of developers who have managed to salvage something half decent from a mess of a kickstarter and then proceeded to nearly kill it at birth with an awful launch... grats  Also see below for old review and all the features promised in kickstarter that don't exist at launch.  OLD REVIEW:Terrible terrible scam of a game... don't believe me go check out the old details on their own website for a game that used to be called Umbra.  Stay a while and listen adventurer.  Once upon a time some ambitious developers promised us the pinnacle of ARPGs, it would have full open world maps, customising everything right down to what hilt we would have on weapons, player housing and an innovative dungeon system where you build dungeons for others to challenge, a headline feature called apocalyptic form that offered a new way of making your characters unique. They kickstarted the game got lots of money and promised lots of features.  Fast forward to today the game has been scrapped and started again TWICE now, every time the goals and ambitions of the project get more and more narrow, as of the current beta they dont even have a female character model its something (and i quote one of the developers directly here) they ""Hope to add back in at release""  The list of broken promises, half truths, outright lies, bad PR, bad communication, contempt for their fans is honestly to long to go into. Just recently a forum member discovered by judiciously reading the terms of service on the new beta (or alpha v2.0 as i like to call it) that they intend to implement a microtransactions cash shop for 'just cosmetic' items. This was never in their plans, in fact as early as late last year the lead developer stated they ""Had no intention of having a cash shop"" yet here we are with them preparing to have one just like POE does, except In a full price game. Note the conflict here with the huge level of customisation they promised in the original kickstarter.  Whats more the recent beta (alpha v2.0 in everything but name) is more limited and simplistic than the original alpha we had 2 years ago. Of course go to the forums and you'll see the usual white knight brigade saying how 'its a beta if you dont like it leave' except this isn't the beta I or many other backed, they did a total 180 on us and changed the whole scope of the project to some generic Diablo rip off with boring mechanics and a cash shop. Features like housing, dungeons all that is gone never spoken of, who knows it might get implemented some time around 2050 at this rate.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY wait till they release it (so never most likely)"
96311004,english,1,424370,"I wasn't there at launch of this game so I have no animosity towards this title unlike others. My thoughts are from a single player offline experience.  Pros   -Incredible Graphics with highly detailed Items and landscapes.   -Awesome combat system   -A compelling story with epic villains.   -The boss battles   -Large variety of Landscapes and villains   -Runs quite well. Can't think of single problem I've had.    -The overall aesthetic is just awesome, a blend of Warhammer 40k and Dark Fantasy.    -Great character progression.   -Extensive campaign. Cons.   -Not a fan of having separate characters for offline and online play.   -Extensive campaign.

50524556,english,0,424370,"This review may change...  At this point the game completely changed from something unique that was promising, to a Diablo clone. I had high hopes for this and about a year ago it was good. They shifted direction so much that it's not even remotely what the vision used to be. I'm still hopeful but to be honest it's probably just gonna be a failed Diablo clone with the direction it's going.  Update:  I'm sorry but these people don't know what they are doing. I've had this game for a long time and in the beginning it had so much potential with cool new ideas, beautiful artwork, open-world exploration, a skill tree that seemed to have limitless customization and a lot more than I'd rather not get into considering most of all of that is completely gone and replaced with some cookie cutter wanna-be Diablo clone and it's depressing. I don't recommend buying this game to anyone considering. Wait until it is fully released IF it ever is fully released. They have scrapped everything original about this game and restarted with nothing to write home about.  Update#2: Still trash. Nuff said...  Update#3: Still trash. These people really just screwed themselves. Should have stuck to making something new and not cloning other games. Kinda sad..."
92514356,english,1,424370,"Over 70 hours of gameplay on the clock, so thought it time to review this game.  TL;DR - This game is an excellent example of an ARPG/Hack-and-Slash. It may have its origins in a Diablo/Path of Exile clone, but it is far more than that and I'm actually preferring it to them. It's great fun and probably worth the full price. End game is best in class as far as I'm concerned - Fully realised with an actual purpose.  So, I've just completed the main game and now into end game. I'm still having a blast. Really glad I finally tried this game in spite of the negative reviews. Those reviews seem to stem from the history of a poor release and early bug scene but I can't presume to know everyone's motives. And it is a situation I couldn't blame them for either, but one I luckily avoided arriving a year late. I have encountered some bugs but they haven't been significant. It does feel like this game needs some further polish and tweaks, but again nothing that detracts fundamentally from the great game play. Players asserting this game is 'dead' are entirely unfounded, with the evidence of recent patches and regular development updates and the simple fact I am actively playing a great ARPG with friends.  It has to be said Wolcen is very obviously taking a great deal of its game mechanics directly from Path of Exile and Diablo 3. But this isn't surprising or novel. Beyond that Wolcen has its own vibe and some great little mechanics of its own. Wolcen is the most graphically beautiful APRG I've seen yet and the Cryengine works great in here. The astonishing graphics here made me realise one of the main reasons why I never completely got into Grim Dawn (in spite of playing for a couple hundred hours). Going for a classless system is interesting and I've always liked it since the days of Dungeon Siege. At the very least it stops me from feeling I'm playing another copy of some pool of classic builds. I would really have liked there to be a much greater diversity of character appearance choices to counter this because there are fundamentally no more than 5 looks per sex currently - which is ridiculous considering how easy this would be to implement. The active dodge gives the game a surprisingly enjoyable extra dimension I wouldn't, on paper, have expected to be this fundamental. It immediately brings a level of tactics and skill generally absent from ARPG games. But it also makes you feel your character more dynamic. The skills are varied, impactful and fun - some of them have real oomph to them. The ability to modify each one in fundamental ways is an excellent game choice reminiscent of Path of Exile's support gem design. One thing I have noticed so far is the game seems to encourage variability in skills and attack strategy. This means I'm using the full skillbar of 5 actions frequently in each encounter which stops the feeling of spamming one super skill continually many other ARPGs seem to fall into. Collecting them in loot drops and levelling them independently of your character is again very PoE but works well. It also avoids the frustrating trap of having to find items that will cater for the skills you want that PoE creates (although I wouldn't argue with you if you felt that was a feature). The items I have to admit I'm still getting used to, but the lack of a straight armour class stat is interesting and opens up the item collection in interesting ways. The almost direct rip off of the talent tree from PoE I just can't argue with because to me it is currently the best way of implementing this. The literal twist to it works great too. I also love the fact that this game is not built on the depressing requirement to play through 3 times to reach the end game. It was always a lame way of hiding a lack of content and story. The Boss fights so far have been some of my favourite in any ARPG. They've challenged me in the exactly the right way. The phases and pacing of the bosses have been brilliant, and pushed me to move and use space tactically. Giving characters three in-combat revives (Revive tokens) is an excellent way of preventing the frustration of an insta-kill or a simple mistake ruining the flow and experience.  The ability to modify and paint your character's gear is pretty inconsequential but is a nice touch and does, to some extent, make up for the lack of character appearance adjustment at the beginning. I also love the 'God-mode' or Avatar of Destruction. It isn't essential, but it is a heck of a lot of fun! The voice acting is generally pretty good and the dialogue is sharp and witty - some of it made me laugh out loud.  My criticisms are generally minor. Obviously they do need to prioritise fixing the bugs and improving stability - but again, I appear to arrived at the point where playability is no longer seriously impacted by any. I think there may be too many trash mobs making general progression at times seem a bit too easy. This is countered by the sprinkling of interesting elites with equally interesting abilities which at times require rapid adaptation. Despite all the interactive terrain features I would like to be able to go into more buildings and access more land features. I would also favour a little more sideline areas to make the progression feel less linear, but it's not a major issue here and there are plenty of side dungeons scattered around. Grim Dawn would be a good comparison for great map design. Overall the story campaign is very linear with virtually no side quests. Again, Grim Dawn would be a good example of how to do an interesting quest structure. I was surprised at how quickly the first two tiers of items (normal and magic) became completely obsolete, but this may be just be amnesia of every other ARPG on my part. The vendors really need to shut up after a while!  The long-term lastability of Wolcen will essentially rest upon the end-game, and I may check in again to update my review once I've played end game for a while, but basically the main game is in my opinion solid."
84601932,english,1,424370,"With a little over a couple hundred hours in game, I can recommend this one BUT, and a big but, be aware of what you're getting.  If you've read any of the other reviews then you're aware that the game is a buggy mess and the balancing issues are a work in progress, so I won't go too much into them; everyone else already has.  Considering the game has almost been out for a year and some bugs that I encountered on day one are still in the game is alarming.  But improvements have been made to both bugs and balancing so I guess there's something to be said for that.  Just read the reviews and make sure you can tolerate the game in it's current state.  That being said lets talk about why I like this game.  It's Beautiful.  No other ARPG can touch it on that one.  Also, it sounds great.  I crank the volume up high when I'm playing.  Combat feels great.  When you consider that the main point of an  ARPG is to go around slaying monsters by the thousands, then you want it to feel good while you do.  And Wolcen does just that.  It truly looks, sounds and feels great to spend hours slaying monsters.  Some reviewers have commented that the end game is redundant and boring but then again so is D3 and POE in that regard.  Again, in an ARPG you just slay monsters over and over again and in Wolcen that feels better than others.  Admittedly I think they could spice things up in the end game, but it's not that bad.  Another point that reviewers often gripe about is the crafting.  It's plenty in depth enough and the rewards for doing so CAN be there.  But as may others have said, you're basically playing a lottery where you can slightly shift odds in your favor.  Some hate that because you can never get the ""perfect"" gear.  They think that with enough work and investment you should get the perfect piece.  On the contrary, I like that you can never get the perfect piece, but rather keep trying and trying and eventually a piece comes out slightly better than the last and it's an upgrade.  In other words you are constantly getting better gear and working towards perfect but you'll never get there.  I actually like it that way.  Lastly, the theory crafting and ""builds"".  For me, Wolcen hit that sweet spot between D3 and POE.  D3 is too straight forward.  There's basically one right way to play your class.  And POE, well, we all know that one.  In D3 I usually play my class as the meta for the season.  In POE I give up and look up a youtube video.  In Wolcen, I make my own build.  I play around, test and tinker my way to something that works.  It's in the sweet spot where it's not so overwhelming that you just borrow someone else's work, but its not so straight forward that you can only play the game one way.    I recommend this one, but do you research.  Read all the other reviews and make sure you know if this game is for you.  I'm posting what I like about it because maybe someone is thinking about the game but can't find anything good about it buried in all the reviews about how bad the bugs and balance are.  I'm not saying those reviews aren't valid because they absolutely are.  I'm just saying through all the problems there is quite a bit to like about the game."
63480332,english,0,424370,"Currently a buggy mess. Played into act 2 and had to restart, where it sent me back to the beginning of the game at level 25. Lost all my waypoints and quests. Wait until they fix this up and lots of people say it's stable."
84770747,english,1,424370,"I have about 108 hours into Wolcen now. There is still a lot of game breaking bugs that shouldn't exist at this stage and the campaign was so bugged that I had to play the last mission 7-10 times in a row because it bugged out. Its almost to the point the campaign feels unbeatable solely due to bugs.   That being said, I freaking love this game. I wish I could come on here and say ""its not worth the money, don't buy"" however, I cant because at the end of all the bugs is a game that has so much promise and a very engaging and fun play style for the ARPG genre.   I wont talk mechanics because you can look those up on youtube. I just wanted to be one of the honest reviewers and say, this game has play value and replay value even with the overwhelming amount of bugs and sometimes crashes (for online play).   All in all, if you are a big fan of ARPG's and want a new one to play. I can fully back that this game is worth the money. I won't try to hide its problems from the bugs. (I cannot stress enough that there are tons of bugs and am purposely being repetitive, because I dont want to be what made you comfortable purchasing the game and then not be able to overlook the bugs)  The ONLY gamer I would say that should heavily avoid Wolcen are those who are only after an ARPG for the multiplayer experience. Please do not buy if you are not intending on playing solo and trying multiplayer occasionally to see if its running decent for the night.  I am the type that will get in discord and discuss what I am finding, doing, and experiences with my friends who are also playing solo and I believe that is the type of player who will find this game to be great even through its issues.   Long repetitive ""review"" over. Hope that sheds a slim amount of light on why its listed as mixed reviews."
64157392,english,0,424370,"I normally dont write bad reviews. But this is an exception.   Today patch 1.0.5.0 dropped. What a desaster - these devs obviously have no clue what they are doing. Bleeding edge needed a nerf, no question, but they nerfed the WHOLE passive tree. They altered different skills and descriptions completely which are not part of the patch notes.   I have played 133hours since release, accumulated ALOT of gold and affinity, have 4 chars with over level 50, 2 over 70 and ALL chars earnings where ERASED to 100.000 gold each and 10.000 affinity. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? Whole progress of last week was completely wiped. Also running projects were canceled (guess what, these costs are gone too), items disappeared (quality, rarity upgrades).   When i played the game over the last 4 years since closed alpha, i had high hopes for this one. But today and after 230hours, i applied for a refund. Enough is enough.  This game is a broken, buggy mess. And the nice graphics doesnt help either.  I am done with this."

The devs of this game would rather send threatening private messages trying to dissaude you from making negative comments, than actually communicate positively with their community.

128140687,english,1,424370,"I have one MAJOR gripe with this game so far.  And that's with the limited tiny space for stash inventory. The stash inventory space amount is way too tiny for the average player.  It's extremely frustrating.  Every time I visit the Stash Inventory chest, all I want to do is log the hell off, because its so annoying. Each Tab for Stash inventory should be at least 4x to 8x as large from what it is now. People like to stash weapons and armor for other characters they create but cant because of the EXTREMELY limited stash space given. In games like this, Stash Inventory should be MUCH MUCH more, because this game depends on players, to collect items throughout their game play and you cant do that, if the player is hindered and limited in the Stash Inventory. This needs to be fix ASAP.  This is a Great game to play, and I do recommend people to play it if they like games like, Path Of Exile, Victor Vran, Grim Dawn, Lost Ark  So on and so forth.   Also IMHO, the game looks better when its dark,  because everything else glows really awesome. When you first start the game, everything is so bright, but then at a certain point when you complete a certain mission and go back to the main town, its dark and it looks really really nice. ( I like it a lot).  I was forced to play in OFF-LINE Mode, because the online mode would not let me log back on the next to when I wanted to continue the game. I made it to level 18 in online mode. I logged off because it was really late. When I logged back on the next day to continue, the game would not let me continue as all I got was a black screen instead.  So I was forced to start all over again from level 1 via OFF-LINE Mode.  Also I wish I could sell the skills instead of installing the skills I don't want. This game forces players to install the skill first in order for you to sell the extra skills for Primotial. Which is very annoying. I SHOULD be able to sell the skills if I don't want them.   I have more stuff to say,  but I will continue to play first before I add onto this review. Again, This overall is a great game to play for those who have not played it yet. It just has a few things that are very annoying.   Thanks for reading."
107917693,english,1,424370,"[h1] Solid ARPG Experience [/h1]   [b] History [/b]   This game has come a long way since its Early Access days. As reflected in the Steam user review ratings, it has been a rocky road for Wolcen Studio and their flagship title. I've played it off and on since very early in its development. I've seen it go through some major changes and overhauls. The game we have today resembles the original very little. At one point you could even build your own house to display your trophies. It seemed that Wolcen didn't know which direction to go.    They wanted a dark and grim fantasy world ARPG. Hardcore gamers themselves, they wanted to make what they thought Diablo 3 should have been, a lofty and admirable goal. It took them some time to figure out what the fans wanted, but they did, and now it finally shows. This is one of those titles that would have been better off waiting for full release rather than making it available in early access, since current ratings reflect earlier stages of the game. It's a win for players, but the devs take it by way of long-standing negative reviews that remain long after they become irrelevant.    What we ended up with here seems like a compromise between the dev's vision and what the fans wanted. The game is much more like D3 than the devs would probably like to admit, right down to the voice actors and their lines. [url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2478830/] Carla Tassara [/url] ,who apparently does all the female lines in every video game now, is still ""unstoppable!""   [b] Current [/b]   A little history out of the way, the game is currently a solid ARPG experience that fans of the genre are sure to love. If you were disappointed by the early state of the game, now is a great time to dive in and start working a build. A big endgame update is on the way this month, offering 4 new game modes, and I'm excited for that.    What makes Wolcen different from D3, Grim Dawn and PoE? The classless build system. You choose a starting weapon and from there you can adapt your build however you like. Stats are determined by items, equipment and gear. You get your 10 attribute points per level, and passive skill points, to allocate however you like. Certain gear set-ups allow you to hybridize and optimize across different skill sets. You can use both magic and melee if you want. And you can switch it up at any time. This allows for an unprecedented level of freedom in your build. So far I've made a Void Witch, a Toxic Assassin, a Blood Baron, a Holy Crusader, a Pyromancer, and more, some of them from the same character.   Skills and abilities have real impact, they feel nice and weighty, very satisfying to play. Certainly there is a difficulty curve between mobs and bosses. Clearing mobs is no indicator of your ability to take on a big boss. While I haven't had to grind over already tread paths, the option is there if you need it. If you falter at the bosses, it is 100% your build, which is easily remedied by grinding and/or trying something different. The latter is not easily achievable, if at all, in other games in this genre. In Wolcen, you can switch up gear and tweak stats a bit, and voila! a whole new class to try without starting a new character.   The game looks amazing, built on CryEngine, it is more detailed than any top-down isometric I've ever played. It is truly stunning to explore the different environments. The gameworld is a work of art, and the 3D models for everything from gear to actors are no less aesthetic. This is a labor of love and it truly shows.   If you tried it before and walked away with a bad taste, try it again, you will be pleasantly surprised. Wolcen is a must-play for any ARPG fan.  *My ReShade preset [url=https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/11817/] Wolcen Grit RTX [/url]"

94006446,english,0,424370,"I came into it initially positive, but largely unsure of what I was getting myself into. I had a few thousand hours in PoE at this point and had recently burned out on D3. Suffice to say, the initial experience was very good - in fact, I'd say this game is honestly ahead of the curve of the current crop of ARPGs. It looks and feels like a next-gen ARPG in the vein of PoE2. I was very impressed with the game overall...right until I finished the main story. The story starts out alright, continues to be alright with some questionable plot twists, and then completely crashes and burns because of Heimlock. Not spoiling anything, but he's the most bullshit character ever written and the last 20 minutes of the story drove me continually more and more insane until the ending made me scream and still remains my favourite thing to rant about to anyone who will listen.  Beyond that, my experience up to that point had been very good. The ability system works well and allows for decent customisation, but there are some egregious cases of absurdly powerful combinations. Combat is very dynamic with an emphasis on using every one of your skill slots for a purpose, and dodging is just nice to have. Bosses are...mostly well designed, more readable, more convincing and more involving than some of PoE's bosses, but also easier to cheese. I did however find fault with targeting being horrific especially for melee, I continually found myself either running circles around what I wanted to attack, or being unable to stop attacking a target to interact with something or attack the thing next to it; it just never does what you want it to. Pacing feels a little weird, as there are groups of enemies predictably spaced out with considerable distance between them throughout every area, and on top of that enemy variety feels lacking with a lot of mooks wearing different shirts. There is also a distinct lack overall in abilities to use which hinders the variety in playstyles, The passive skill tree is a nice idea implemented poorly, with a mess of passives that seem to have no distinct rhyme or reason to what stats they give you or where they lead, often with notables that contribute very little to your build in comparison to just dumping points in random passives that lead nowhere. Oh, and Aspects of Apocalypse exist. Don't get hyped for them, they're almost completely useless after you beat the main story, because they don't scale with your character. All your stats are set to 0 when you activate them and your gear has no effect, so you'll rapidly outgrow their capabilities and they'll serve only to give you a temporary HP boost if you're in a bad spot.  Endgame feels like a pointless exercise, which may sound rich coming from someone that played D3 and PoE, but hear me out. You are to rebuild the city of Stormfall by way of constructing notable building projects and launching Expeditions, which are three randomly generated dungeon stages that can be modified for greater rewards by spending a small sum of gold or using a map item. Completing them grants Productivity which is scaled by your finished city projects and the difficulty of the expedition. There are a large number of projects to undertake which either grant you bonuses directly, like increased gold and magic find or unlocking an extra ability slot, or open up greater crafting options and new shops. The problem is...I can't find a point to any of them. There is no real goal that you're working towards other than ticking all the boxes on the Stormfall map. D3 wasn't much better so I can't say much there, but PoE is in a different league (haha) to Wolcen. Where Wolcen asks you to just pootle around doing whatever until you get bored, PoE tantalises you with bossfights, extra story, unique items and of course, better and more loot. For a time it was a big deal working your way to the centre of the Atlas to fight and beat the Shaper, and if you wanted to get that far you had to grind your map progress, push yourself and refine your build to perfection. In Wolcen...there's no drive. You can stay fighting level 40 enemies forever if you want, because there's not much reason to go any further. Maybe if you're an obsessive completionist you'll find fun here, but I've already burned out on it very rapidly twice over.  Lastly, a note on Bloodstorm, bugs/performance and ongoing development: I've played through the game twice, before and after Bloodstorm, and burned out on Stormfall restoration shortly after starting it both times. Bloodstorm is a...rather underwhelming update that adds a league-style mechanic to the base game and expeditions that's slightly neat but feels mostly inconsequential, and includes a new side story completely unrelated to the absolute bullshit main story that I doubt will ever be addressed. Supposedly it included a lot of performance updates and bugfixes, I've never had any noticeable issues with either in the past or recently but I've seen a lot of reviews slamming the game for terrible optimisation and game-breaking issues, so YMMV. As for development...I bought and played the game a year ago, and so far it seems the side story, league mechanic thingy and some new areas are the only new content they've brought out. There's been some tweaks to the passive tree and updates to abilities, as well as the aforementioned bugfixes, but otherwise it seems to have been fairly stagnant and I wouldn't hold out hope for things to suddenly turn around.  TL;DR, it's a decent game for a while, but is shallow and trying desperately to cover up its lack of development and refinement. Worth buying on sale if you need an ARPG fix, but it doesn't feel like it rewards your time investment in the end. It just feels like the developers dreamed up a vibrant world full of characters and lore and spent all their budget on voice acting and visuals, then realised this alone wasn't going to make a game and the remainder of the time and budget was spent piecing together an ARPG. Also screw Heimlock, all my homies hate Heimlock."
48979517,english,0,424370,"Reasons for my thumbs down and I refuse to re-review this game with any other ratings. Wouldn't doubt if I was perma banned after leaving my review.  - Devs are passive aggressive and very rude. - Numerous promises made to implement different mechanics or ideas into the game. - Updates are extremely slow and they dont give you any sort of information when they occur. - Same promo material gets recycled over and over. - 3 Years of early access and the game is pretty much in the same state. - 20 bucks for 1 hour of game play in early access is not worth the cost. - Same content keeps getting ""reworked"" time and time again.

190762850,english,0,424370,"Developers abandoned the game and it is not finished. DO NOT BUY.  I bought the game years ago to support development with the intention to play it when complete but instead they gave up, took the money and ran."
69078465,english,0,424370,"[b]3rd December update: Fabled patch 1.1.0.0, Bloodtrail. Tons of things have been reworked, added and there seems to be significant differences. But performance seems to have been downgraded, game stutters, audio disappears, there's still multiplayer lag, visual bugs and glitches, progress stopping bugs and glitches and worst of all, loss of progress in offline mode. Better luck with the next patch. And any kind of communication from the developers is still non-existent. I don't think they're even considering cakes.[/b]  Publishing $20 extended soundtracks when your game, which was promising, is in a rather sorry state, lost most of it's players faster than DC it's audience after the Martha/Moustache fiasco, is still fuller of bugs than a medieval rat catcher's straw bed after a week of work, has an almost non-existent and pointless endgame and your communication with what's left of the playerbase (your loyalists) on all fronts is in the ""Let them eat cake"" area is an absolutely brilliant business decision. Best guess? You're trying to upstage Sean Murray in a few years time? Yes/No/Maybe?  With that out of the way, should you buy this game in it's current state? Short answer, no. There's nothing on offer here that you can't get in Path of Exile, Grim Dawn or even Last Epoch, which is in early access, but cheaper and with a more responsive team behind it.  After 90 hours, and some time spent in the endgame (up to lv139 expedition, no point in going any further), the expeditions became boring. The town building aspect the game features in the endgame is a good idea and fun in the beginning, but once you realize most buildings have no actual effect on the gameplay and those that do don't really change anything, it becomes a wasteful time sink. As does the ""crafting"" system the game features. It's hilariously expensive, ineffectual and has more in common with Konami's gambling machines than any actual crafting. The loot drops and upgrades are less epic than the reception Epic Games Store recieved when it opened it's flimsy doors, legendaries are underwhelming and unique items are almost completely useless apart from a few which are almost mandatory for useful builds.  The game features a passive skill tree which will be immediately familiar to any Path of Exile players with a few extra twists. That's a lot of skills and possible variations. Too bad most of them are useless and using them will effectively gimp you in the endgame, thus forcing you to use the same skills and builds (or at least similar) everybody else does if you want to progress to harder expeditions. The summoner builds were grossly underwhelming, with horrible AI and terrible scaling, but this seems to have been addressed in the latest patch (1.0.14, May 13th). Active skills are based on enneracts that are buyable in town and drop as loot from monsters. Skills can level up and have modifiers which you can mix and match, but not all the modifiers seem to actually be working, even after a few patches.  The combat controls are wonky, that's the best way to put it. There's something off with them and there's a visible delay on skills firing off. You can see the on-screen button getting pressed when you press the keyboard button, but it sometimes takes a few presses for the skill to actually register. ARPG combat is usually fast and frantic, but targeting in Wolcen really doesn't help with that. There were times when I clicked on a mob and the character never did anything or went to pick up loot which was near the mob I clicked. I even witnessed a character unable to attack a mob because he was in the middle of it and I had to ""move out"" of the mob to attack it. There's a dodge mechanic in the game based on a stamina system that's equally wonky due to animation locks and the mentioned skill delays. There's a very noticeable difference in difficulty between normal mobs and boss fights and it's somewhat ridiculous and poorly balanced, no matter what your build is.  Champions of Stormfall (the endgame) rewards for finishing expeditions is abysmal, even the high level ones. There's no gold drop scaling with higher expedition levels. Or any scaling that actually has any effect. I've found items with a high level difference between them, but no actual improvements on their stats. Oh, and there's a thing called mandates that you can do instead of expeditions. I think I clicked on one, once, in another dimension? Grinding out the town building part is tedious with no promise of any substantial or even noticeable rewards. Experience gains also drastically slow, to a snails pace, somewhere around lv 70, maximum level is 90. There's some serious grind involved getting to 90 (badly padding out the game in lieu of non-existent endgame?), like working in a mind melting office job.  The game also touts something called the Aspects of the Apocalypse, ""...one of the 4 Celestial incarnations available, each of them offering 4 different skills, and one devastating ultimate"". I've used it exactly once and it was part of the story. It was supposed to be something useful, useable and fun. It came out as useless, underpowered and completely forgettable.  The only redeeming quality, if I can call it that, is the game's visuals. They're really top notch for today's standards, but the performance is all over the place. I've had serious FPS drops on an RTX2070, 32GB of RAM, i7 and an SSD.  There were, there probably still are, a lot of good ideas for this game, but it went haywire somewhere. The main game page still has ""...regular updates and seasonal events..."" and a long term commitment statement from the developers. They've done a couple of small updates (which are around 3GB in size, go figure) which are purportedly fixing bugs and they've laid out some kind of a longer road map (catch-all term in the gaming industry nowadays), but there's a lot of work here in the controls, balancing, itemization, scaling and getting some goodwill back from the larger part of the community. The ethereal 1.1.0 that the developers promise is a long way away. The review will be updated if something actually changes.

In 90 hours, I managed to get ""Pick up 1 million gold"". That's a loooot of hours the developers intended for you to play this game. There's three achievements for getting to level 30, 60 and 90 without dying. Since the experience gain flutters out like a candle in the wind past 70, getting to 90 without dying might prove a slight problem. The others are pretty much self explanatory and no real problem. One is bugged (at least it still was when I got it in 1.0.9, there's been a few patches since), Princely Patronage, it popped when I only built one building, not all three required for the achievement."
64199029,english,0,424370,"As I said before, I came back after the Arise Patch for a rework of my review. So this was updated at 9/11/2021:  I did a whole new campaign playthrough as a summoner character. I finished the campaign at level 38, played 5 random dungeons after that, but since my previous progress was saved, there was no reason to keep grinding for the irrelevant city-building mode of the endgame. So I played about 10 hours in the new patch.  Summary: it still looks decent. The controll for range characters are ok, but please don't play melee, it's a mess.   Now that almost all technical hurdles have been solved, the real problems of the game come to light. There is still no motivating item system. I hated it when any red items were dropped (legendary), because I always knew that they didn't contain any character development or interesting properties. I only found 11 uniques in my 82 hours and since I picked up every single one I can say that they are all full of interesting to read but completely incomprehensible properties and I didn't find a single unique that made me stronger. That's why the uniques lie unused in the box. Even after more than 80 hours I usually can't tell from the itemstats if this one makes me better or not. There are simply too many incomprehensible properties and virtually no development through the items.  For whom is Wolcen in this state suitable? For people who love ARPGs but have already tasted everything else? No, because a new saison of Diablo 3 or a new character in Diablo 2 are simply much more fun. Diablo 3 plays several scales better, especially for melee characters, and Diablo 2 has such an iconic item system that every unique drop creates a moment of joy. Ergo, I can't think of a target audience.  Is it still possible to make Wolcen a success? From a developer's point of view, I think so, since they now have a reasonably stable technical base. But since the developers don't publish a roadmap, that shows that they have understood the real problems, I don't see enough insight here. Maybe you should buy the game to finance a 2nd part which will take care of the problems of the 1st part right from the beginning.  Yes I will comeback after the next content patch release for an updated review."

180612086,english,0,424370,"Wolcen is a mess of a game. I recently picked it up after they announced Online Play was being shuttered. As such, this review treats Wolcen as a singleplayer experience.   Wolcen has a solid foundation. It has decent moment-to-moment gameplay with satisfying combat and movement and decent character progression. The skill tree has an interesting ""rotation"" mechanic, allowing you to rearrange it to suit your needs. Your active skills have modifiers to their behavior that can be freely switched at any time, similar to Diablo 3's skill system. This opens the doors for lots of experimentation and varied behavior in skills. Gear crafting was almost cool, but the complete lack of transparency made it more frustrating to use. Voice acting made the admittedly cliche story much more engaging. The post-game has a cool ""city-builder"" gameplay loop, but it doesn't feel fully fleshed out.  The progression system's negatives begin to show themselves in the endgame. Many mechanics like multiple projectiles don't work properly, pets are an after thought, a loot filter is sorely needed, and leveling past 70 is a snooze without using cheats. Most stats are ""score based"" in their design, meaning they become less effective at higher level zones to artificially increase the difficulty by making your character weaker. Your crit/resistances/dodge rate/ailment application all get less effective the more you progress, bricking builds that rely on them. Enemy resistances also scale this way, with no way to shred them, which makes life leech less and less effective as you progress. You also cannot swap weapon sets, or save loadouts for skills/transmogrification, which would have been a great QoL addition.  There's a lot holding back Wolcen technically. The final cutscene of the game fails to load, skipping you to the credits. The UI doesn't always behave, where you can't pick up items or select certain UI elements, sometimes locking you in a menu. Animations are rough around the edges. The difficulty of the campaign needed to be cranked up a ton. It just got boring quickly even on max difficulty, despite the scenarios and maps being fairly well done.   For most people, I don't recommend picking up Wolcen. If you're morbidly curious, or starved for ARPG content, it's good value when discounted under $10."
134648264,english,0,424370,"The new company that took over from the old one had a great chance to create some momentum for themselves & the game. Finally completing the story mode after 3 years is not something to be taken lightly, especially after inheriting the original devs' mess.  Several years of dev ignorance & being passed onto a new team, Wolcen had the opportunity to give us something to play for some time before Diablo 4 launches. They had opportunity after opportunity to blow us away. They still have not.  Everything bad I remember from Wolcen launch version is still all I see in Wolcen 2023. I started fresh with a new Offline toon - deleted the one I hadn't touched since February 2020 - and nothing has changed, nothing has improved.  The general consensus is that the latest patch that includes the elusive Chapter 4 somehow made the game even worse than it already was. Existing bugs still exist, and they've managed to create more new ones. In short: it's an absolute disaster. But I wanted to see it for myself.  I stuck with Offline mode because I recall the online servers being a complete mess, and people are still reporting game-breaking bugs left and right today. No thanks. Not that Offline mode is much better. When you imagine playing offline, you think of zero lag and much faster response time because you're no longer subject to online ping. Right?  WRONG! The godawful input lag of about half-a-second I remember from February 2020 is STILL present after 3 years. Spell casting is still slow and sluggish regardless of your increased attack speed, and general movement is still like walking through thick mud. Optimization is still the sheets.  Then you have STILL the amateur mistake of a fully uncovered zone map. It completely ruins your sense of Exploration AND wastes your time by almost forcing you to walk around in circles, because you can't tell if you haven't been to a certain map location before. And if you're the type of gamer who likes to explore every inch of the map to see what you can find & use as you level up, it's a HUGE problem.  And then, everything I hated about Wolcen launch version still present in Wolcen 2023: ITEMIZATION.  Nothing is worth farming, every item in the game is a BORING stat-stick with not a single interesting affix to speak of. Skill damage increases over time the more you use it, and you tweak it further with various nodes you unlock during the skill levelling process. And that's all in regard to skill customization.  What the different versions of Wolcen team always fails to grasp is: In games like this Loot-hunting is half the fun, finding exciting new items and affixes that potentially alter your personal play-style and increase the Fun factor. Take that away, and you lose half the fun, because gear choices hardly matter.  Furthermore, it completely kills Replayability. There's nothing worth farming, so you have no reason to keep playing. You complete the story mode once and then you toss the game in the trash, which is exactly what I did 3 years ago when I completed the incomplete story. And what I just did once again, for good.  Thankfully I bought the game for 20 bucks when it was still called Umbra and it was during its alpha phase, when it had the most potential with its rotating camera view & awesome unique elemental staff attacks - both of which were removed from the game in the transition to Beta & mediocrity. I feel sorry for those who paid full price for this, especially long before today.  I feel even more sorry for all the early Kickstarter backers who were promised open-world exploration, a fantastic character creator, in-game housing, and lots of other great features. None of which survived the transition to Beta & the live game. Basically, we got RIPPED OFF.  Such a damn shame, tons of potential. Looks fantastic, great skill graphics, gorgeous level design & crisp textures, all Wolcen needed is a dev team with a clue. So many years later, still fresh out of that."

81633347,english,0,424370,"Like many, I will begin by saying I really didn't want to put this as a negative review. I picked it up at the later end of the beta, beat the beta with a friend, and decided that the game had potential. Well, it surely did.  So, my first impressions of the game were that the graphics were good, animations were a bit clunky or stiff, but the gameplay was decent. At a core it combines elements from Torchlight (damage types apply effects), Diablo 3 (arcade feel, modifiable abilities, numerous questionable design choices), and Path of Exile (Gate of Fates is the same massive unlocked stat tree, classless, abilities are functionally similar), slapped with an original stat system that worked like many other ARPGs out there. I had no real problems with some of this, but did it improve over time? No.  Upon release there were mass server issues, which basically meant the game was unplayable online. This wouldn't be a problem if the game allowed transfer of characters between offline/online. It doesn't. Never has, likely never will. I understood both of these issues to a degree, since the game exploded in popularity. I won't count that against the game, as it the problem was resolved in a time that I would consider acceptable. Still, there was a lot of negative stigma that came with this. As for characters, it's an anti-cheat measure. To be honest, I don't care for it. Grim Dawn has become my favorite ARPG by far, and my favorite game overall. I can play with my friends whenever I want, and offline whenever I want. And if I go into a pub game, I can accept someone may have item edited something in. But if I see it, I can leave. If you're hosting, you can just boot ""cheaters."" This annoys me since I have to play with an online character if I ever want to do multiplayer, and boom, I get a server in Ohio and have to deal with 79 ping 24/7. Not too high, but high enough to be noticeable. Are people going to be annoyed if this was allowed? Yes. Am I inconvenienced and annoyed? Yes. So either way, there's no real winning for the devs.  So I kept playing once everything was fixed, and proceeded to the endgame. There's no new game+, but there is Champion of Stormfall, which is a 3 stage dungeon crawler mode with the option to roll modifiers. Upgrade a city with massive amounts of resources and craft. Pretty basic, but this is where the game has (had, perhaps, since the game was just updated) massive balancing issues. I began to climb the rungs of the ladder into higher and higher levels, noting that gear level was dropping at monster levels rather than mine. This might matter in other games, but here, loot just became bland and mindless. The better majority became useless, and soon I found item level was essentially pointless. All that mattered were item modifiers, and good luck rolling what you wanted. Crafting materials followed a Path of Exile styled re-rolling system, but with even more RNG involved. Slotted gems were supposed to guarantee attributes of that gem type, but eventually I found that even that didn't matter. But after finding a red shield with good rolls, gear and dying also became irrelevant. Mechanically speaking, the game before Bloodtrail was beyond busted in terms of balance. I'll go more into detail about that below comparing the game then to now, but I quit once I reached the last possible level tier before coming close to max level.  So I reached about 90 hours, and that was when I quit. I looked back at the game, and began to think. I had built a character full tank (100% investment in the toughness attribute, all red in Gate of Fates), and was able to do enough damage to lag the game. I looked into what others had said, and why the game was mixed. Bugs were without a doubt the foremost issue. I can't offer anything there, because until Bloodtrail, I hardly experienced any, and as such, I will not speak on it unless it happened to me. So what were my problems, besides the loot above?   Abilities and damage were just years apart from each other. There's one thing for an ability being good, but enemy scaling in this game was dreadful. Bosses obtained millions and millions of HP, on top of modifiers. In the end game, I feel everything came down to Mark of Impurity. When a monster died, it had an option to detonate for damage based on its HP. The mark also had an option to spread on death- and this is where the ability was disgusting on anything. A tank could use a dagger to unlock the ability, throw on Juggernaut, and detonate whole late game waves and bosses in one combo. With enemies at level 170~ and a level 60-70 character, a boss could be one shot by pulling any 5 minions into the area, marking one, and then killing it when the boss was close. Has this been addressed? Yes. Mark of Impurity now deals weapon damage. But after running through the game with everything globally re-adjusted, everything just felt bland. After consecutive nerfs to ailment damage, mark, shifts to Gate of Fates, playing through the game again just felt bland. I tried doing a lifesteal dual wield build, and to cobble together something from it, but values are just incomprehensibly low now. Investing one point in agility gives 0.1% attack and casting speed, with 10 attribute points per level. So it went from one extreme to the other, where one everything was just too explosive and sometimes satisfying, to changes feeling so minute that the difference between Bleeding Edge (a rotating axe spell) and Wrath of Baapheth (Kratos style advancing chain blades) was ""do you want to walk forward and deal 250 damage, or stay still and deal 240 damage?"" This just dulled down the overall feel and made nothing feel like it mattered. Leveled up? 4% more HP and 0.5% global lifesteal as a major node.   This is already a wall of text near the limit, so here's a cut down summary:  The devs reacted a bit late to this problem, and Bloodtrail wasn't the solution. They tried, but the game was just in a mediocre spot. They released a massive balance patch, but it didn't change the basic issues the game has. There an essay I could write on strange decisions (the tough enemy modifier, crit scaling down with player level), but all of that's wasted. I was patient, and I wanted to like this game after it was patched. So I watch for an update, and then here it comes. Bloodtrail. I hoped for a new act for the story, but hey, a revamp of almost all stats in game, player and enemy. And behold, one whole playthrough and I don't feel like playing anymore. What was Bloodtrail, really? A Path of Exile league. OId characters became legacy, and new ones were needed to play it. For me, it even added more bugs as the final boss decided to leap into the void twice in his second stage, forcing me to quit to the main menu and reload. And new crashes for no apparent reason, along with glorious audio bugs that basically muted the game. I beat it deathless in my second run, and I'm done waiting for fixes. It's time to watch Last Epoch, and hope it doesn't turn into this.  I know this is a lot of negativity, but I will admit, the game doesn't feel like it was hollow like some assembly line cast metal piece. It felt like it had some heart put into it. So if a dev ever reads this, I want them to know that you did make something interesting. Even if the animations feel like those Chinese YouTube mobile game ads (sorry), the writing may feel it a bit cheesy at times, the art style was good. Enemies were well done, and each faction was visually distinct. Sound design was fine, and environments were pleasing most of the time. This was far from a dumpster fire, and there's people out there that still like your game. They might still get hate like they did before, but it's far from deserved.   This game's just not worth it, and it's not heading where it ought to be, and so I'm heading to other options."
66716231,english,1,424370,"I wanted to take my time before publishing a review of this game. It is now April 5, we are multiple patches in, and I have a lvl 78 character who is working on their last upgrade for the endgame city. I love ARPGs and play almost all of them to their endgame.  TLDR: Fun combat, great visuals, nice campaign, but a shallow endgame means this title does not have the longevity you might expect from the genre. Lots of potential, but it hasn't achieved its best yet.   Bugs: I have only encountered a few bugs in the game. Nothing I encountered was game breaking. I see lots of people struggling with issues on the forums and reddit, but by some small miracle I've avoided most (except those that impact talents and skills).  Combat: This game is slower and more deliberate than POE or D3. I find that combat is heavy. This leads to well designed boss fights that I found exciting and interesting. The addition of a stamina bar for dodging (complete with i-frames) is welcome to the genre. It allows mechanics to be designed with this resource/skill in mind. It is not your typical run and gun ARPG as both POE and Diablo have become. Combat has a weight and rhythm to it that you do not often see in an ARPG. I loved this change of pace, but this is just my preference. Further into endgame you can develop into a faster clearing build, but bosses still take effort.   Graphics: Beautiful. This game puts all other ARPGs to shame visually. I love the style, the atmosphere, and the levels. I like that skills are apparent without being overbearing (like POE). I always know what is happening on the screen.   Story: I can't believe I am saying this, but the game has a pretty decent campaign. ARPGs aren't known for their plot, but Wolcen does this very well. I think the game is worth the price for the campaign alone. I really enjoyed my run through the game and I took my time. I felt invested in the story which is antithetical to ARPGs.    Bosses: This is personal preference, but I love the bosses in this game. It reminds me of early Diablo 3 where the boss fights were mechanics driven and took a long time to complete. Act bosses are standouts. Endgame bosses are fairly repetitive.  Skills and Talents: This game has more depth than Diablo 3, but is much simpler than POE. Skills level up, get stronger, and unlock talent points to put into skill modifiers. This allows skills to morph like in POE, but in a more streamlined and easy to grasp fashion. Unfortunately, there are not many viable builds out there at the time of this writing. However, the groundwork is there for a deep skill system.  The talent tree is POE lite. There is a skill tree similar to POE, but each tier of skills can rotate to allow more customization. This is an awesome feature, yet not many builds are late game viable and the potential of this character system is not reached.   End Game: Here is where the game suffers most. End game shows glimmers of brilliance. I love the city building, but it will be too much of a grind for most. The end game functions similar to D3 rifting, but with the ability to use POE style map modifiers. Neat set up, but pushing endgame content to get to the top tier of loot can take a long time. This isn't bad, but it will likely feel like a grind. I can understand how people can get bored with end game in its current state. The lack of terrain, monsters, and bosses adds to the grind. In short, I enjoy the combat so much that it didn't bother me, but this is strictly preference.  Loot: The game has failed in this department, which will hurt it in the long run. Most great end game items are crafted through a POE lite crafting system. Materials are rare and spamming them is required for good items. Uniques are not interesting, most loot is purely vendor trash, and my best items I created myself. Without great loot to chase, the end game will lose its appeal long term. Trading doesn't exist so the economy just doesn't matter. This needs to be addressed to give the game longevity.    Overall: Wolcen is a very pretty ARPG. The combat is different from other ARPGs enough to be worth a play through. The campaign is great and the bosses are interesting. End game is lacking at the moment, so you won't sink thousands of hours into this game. There is so much potential here and pre-COVID-19 I thought the team was getting into a rhythm of patching out bugs/tweaking things. It has slowed down since mid-March, but that is to be expected with the current climate. The team did a great job with the game, but it is not a polished AAA title. It has rough spots, struggles with build diversity, and lacks a motivating end game. The systems have great roots and I expect this game to grow into a great game in the future. Right now, play the campaign and anything you get out of end game is gravy."
72772316,english,1,424370,"[h3]Two words my friend: (no, not [i]""No refunds!""[/i]) [i]""Growing Pains""[/i].[/h3]  Yup, that's the essence of what Wolcen was, and actually still is. It was born in pains and even now, after years of development it still crawls in pain. Unbalanced, unfinished, incomplete. Passives working randomly or not working at all, content missing, various bugs still present: from bad positioning (loot drops under surface) to hits not conecting opponents and so on.  Ok, now you are probably thinking [i]""Dude mistakenly pressed 'I recommend' instead of 'I don't recommend'""[/i]. No, my friend - it's not a mistake. I really do recommend Wolcen. Why? Didn't all those faults spoil my fun? No, they didn't. In fact I am having a hell lot of fun.  I don't know why but I really like this game. Perhaps it's because of its visual side? Wolcen is one of the prettiest action RPGs on the market. It's physics gives you the feeling that your character is really connected to the world and not just hanging hovering in space. Sceneries are beautiful, lots of various characters, mobs and so on. Everything made with a high detail polish. Character customisation for instance - is of the greatest: lots of armor parts in dozens of variations ready to put almost any color combination you want (different paints drop as loot).  Hack and Slash is about two things for me - combat and loot. Wolcen offers a great combat - especially magic. Spells are just awesome. Their power, animations and effects - game gives you the best in it's genre.  Then what about the loot? It's right there. Perhaps not a variety like in other H&S but it's good. Wolcen focuses on rare and legendary item builds (think of it like blues and purples from WOW or Borderlands, the difference lies in number of its abilities). There are also uniques but these are a bit different. They are not a build openers like in Path of Exile where you create a whole build around one item. Here they have their unique abilities but in fact they are just a nice addition to the game, nothing ground breaking. There are no set items at present in Wolcen and I think it's good. Why? Two reasons. 1st - I don't like being limited in selection of abilities offered by set items (after all it's my choice what to use, right?). 2nd - Sets feel very 'final' to me. When you finally complete one, some emptiness comes and you start to think ""Well, so it's done"".  As I have mentioned before, the content is still incomplete. Right now the main campaign fits in 3 acts and they are quite long. At the time I'm writting these words we're pending the next big content patch (hopefully) that is supposed to add next chapter to the game and various optimisation fixes. Personaly I can't wait to it.   In the meantime there is the end game and it's content is not so shabby (compared to other games). In Wolcen it comes in two forms: Mandates and Expeditions. The first one is just a single mission, a random map with a simple task (usualy to kill a number of opponents) that is rewarded with an item, some experience points and gold. Expeditions are more complex. They offer you a fixable level of difficult resulting in better loot drops and amount of experience and gold reward.  There is one more thing in the end game - a micromanagement of the town. You can raise new buildings and they will open new features and enhance character options. Resource that is used for buidling is called Productivity and comes from doing Mandates and Expeditions. It's a nice addition to the game but nothing extraordinary (rather a gold sink and a grind machine for completionists).  Current Metacritic score for Wolcen is something around 60% but most of the bad reviews focuses on technicals - weak optimisation, various bugs resulting in crashes, freezes, poor performance etc. I know that from my own experience, I've also struggled with crashes, memory leaks and so on but in the end I kept coming back to Wolcen. It has this indefinable fun factor that adds ""Just one more map/level/mission!"" thing. Game isn't flawless, actually it has few strong downsides but.. I still like it."
63730788,english,0,424370,"I'm not going to sit here and bore you with the server issues there's plenty of review stressing this.   unfortunately alot of the review tend to skip alot of core gameplay issues that  needs to be addressed , my review is going to touch on a few things that ruins the experince of this game for me personally.  1. Balance issues * so to start i want to touch on the stats balance. first off i can safely say ferocity and toughness is just flat out better in every way. leveling wisdom for ailment status chance is okay but it feel more efficent to just stack ferocity and ignore that stat all together. agilty is extremely weak with only giving attack speed. the attack speed you get tends to be underwhelming considering vast majortiy of your damage is coming from skills and makes usign a right click build (in most cases) feel clunky and not worth it at all.  *class balance feels really bad. SPELL CASTING class set ups feels extremly weak (in part with the way wisdom work in this game) the class as a whole does not scale very well at and the spells available simply just isn't that good.   Melee Rouge feels very weak as well. the amount of point you need to put into agility for your dagger to be useful is way to many and hoestly never truly feels useful. You take ton of damage which forces you to pour points into toughness and in turn take points away from agility making the agility stat just that more useless.   Warrior class is very much overtuned and more specifically Bleeding Edge is the only skill you need to plow the story and currently my late game my level 60 is still strong enough to walk thru level 70+ enemies.  it seems the devs has put alot of work into the melee warrior build with most skills feeling good to some extent unlike a good portion of rouge/spellcaster skills.    2. Skills and UI issues and game clunkiness  * I want to start off by saying that this isn't the case for every skills but for quite a few the skills simple just doesn't work. go into your game now and use sovereign shout with the modifier that stuns and try using it. IT DOESN'T FUNCTION at all (at least for me as of 02/18/2020). I'm sure you can find many more skills like this that has this issue. * Tool tips is another issue. quite a few simply do not give you enough/lacking information.  A skill that comes to mind is Duskshroud when you add the Friendly territoy ( it adds a curse effect to the skill) modifier to the skill it tells you the duration, the chance and the stack but it doesn't tell you what the curse actually do. As a new player you wouldn't know what it does without looking over reddit or a friend. * Unresponsive skills/Hotkeys. i've died a mountian of times in this game simply because my potion hotkey ( Q Key by default) doesn't respond or respond late. in some extreme cases i died with full health. only after i died the potion went off and i was down. only happen once so far but still this shows how unresponsive it is. I find myself clicking skills 3-4 times before they trigger which makes playing the game very frustrating. * Lucky for me i haven't ran into it but charaters being deleted is a issue my friends has run into. I don't know if this has been patched or fixed but just know that this exist quite commonly.   In Conclusion, i personally can't justify spending 40 dollars on this game in its current state. 19.99-24.99 maybe or if you just want to support the company. otherwise the game is sadly a buggy mess that in my opinion would be a decent beta released title, not a full release title.  so as of (02/18/2020) this game in a no for me."
111059876,english,0,424370,"I played this game at launch (2020) and it had some good ideas, but unfortunately it was plagued by bugs. Fast forward to 2022, I gave this game another shot and while some areas improved, unfortunately the game still seem to be a mess.  The graphics is probably one of the best in the ARPG genre, but gameplay wise its lagging behind a lot of the competetiors (Path of Exile, Last Epoch, Grim Dawn, Lost Ark just to name a few). Overall only buy this game if you know what you getting into, otherwise I would suggest to play the other main ARPGs."
132986006,english,1,424370,"If you re not looking for endgame content that'll last forever then, yes, Wolcen is a really nice experience from its start to the end of its current storyline.  The content is still minimal, so this is not a game you can get lost sinking 1,000's of hours in right now. However it's definitely fun, the combat system offers what the other aRPG's do not.  The developers keep breaking their promises and keep going into silent mode; except for a monthly post that often doesn't bring anything really concrete on the table but empty promises.  So if you end up buying the game I'd suggest you to get it during one of its sales."
42030496,english,1,424370,"I read the reviews and I particularly gave attention to the negative ones. It almost made me not purchase and experience the game, fortunately I did and I’m enjoying this game more than my experience with other ARPG so far.. I’m loving the graphics and also the bright environment which I think is one of the factors why I prefer this than other ARPG particularly PoE. looking forward for the multiplayer update!"
189462141,english,0,424370,"Ultimately, I can't recommend Wolcen.  In its current state, the game is as finished as it's going to get, bugs and half-baked storyline and all.  There's a history here: My understanding is that this game was, at launch, a buggy mess. A very *pretty* buggy mess, but still a mess. The devs made a lot of promises while overestimating the scope of the work to create and fix the game.  The released a final patch and then cut and run.  They posted a final update in Maty 2024 indicating the shutdown of multiplayer.  This may not be a direct scam, but it's a close as you get the classic Early Access tale of a developer not following through.  The current state of the game is playable. The story is very engaging, but fizzles out near the end (guessing because they ran out of money) so you get a sudden ""six months later"" epilogue (which is the endgame) in one of the most pivotal moments of the final act.  Combat, mechanics, are okay. Not amazing, I would say feels pretty clunky by PoE2 or D4 standards.  If you can get it for $4 and want to play single-player, that's probably worth your time, but right now the most valuable piece of this product is as a cautionary tale and a ""Remember Wolcen?"" among ARPG fans."
100843543,english,1,424370,"I purchased Wolcen when it was still Early Released and i refunded it.   Fast forwarded to now when the game was already in full launched, I decided to give it a go one more time. Honestly because I was bored waiting for other ARpg since I just finished everything else in my list.   I must say it's been fun journey to finished the solo campaign.   The good thing about Wolcen is they give you the feeling of being kickass. Think of it as Dynasty Warrior (if you ever play one) but in Diablo II format.  Sure it won't be as depth as Grim Dawn or Diablo II. But I still think it is fun to play.   Personally I think this game deserve a little bit more positive rating. After Diablo II and Grim Dawn set the bar so high, I understand why players want only the best since they gonna invested hours in it. But I feel like Wolcen is build for something slightly different, be it intentional or not. It is type of ARpg that you can just start, play for half an hour and exit. Fast pace and action is what I think the main attraction here.   Now I know people compare it a lot to PoE and LE. But I do feel Wolcen stand on its own.   The perfect ARpg might not exist. Diablo II is one of my favorite but obviously I could find a thing or two that might be improved, in my own opinion. With Wolcen, I think they should go with pre-determined class instead of open options (you'll know what I mean if you try the game) but that doesn't mean its a deal breaker for me. It just the route the Developer take and to be honest it is nice to see breath of fresh air of stats other than the traditional strength, dexterity, physical, and magic. I think most of people have complaints because they asked for something groundbreaking and fresh but cry foul when it doesn't suit their expectation.  If I may draw a comparison, this game might be better than Torchlight III (given how much I love Torchlight II) and that is something. At the very least you will feel the battle more ""engaging"" as I am short of words to describe it. I found this especially true with melee character. Every hit connect with enemy feels badass. Even compare to Diablo II Ressurected (which is not apple to apple considering how old the mechanics of D2R already). Can I suspect the player that doesn't like this game is mostly ranged or magic type of character ? Because with Wolcen I always ended up playing melee regardless my initial intention. It just feels more satisfying.   All in all, at the very least you can enjoy the graphic. Sure the game crashed sometimes. During my many hours of run, I crashed 3 times. But luckyly no equipment are lost and believed me it was fine. I honestly experienced more crash with D2R with less hours of gameplay. Luckly none of equipment is lost on both games otherwise it would have been a deal breaker.   Will I invested all of my time to play Wolcen compare to other ARpg ? Highly unlikely. I know I will come back to D2R or GD if there is nothing new and I just want to be nostalgic. But to play Wolcen one run after real life work at the end of the day is really fun. Imagine it as playing relaxing game after hours of Dark Souls (what am I talking about, obviously some of you find Dark Souls relaxing).   Oh I forgot to mentioned you can customize your own character and equipment is detailed visually. You can equip different glove of the left and right hand. As well as different set of shoulder protection. My only complaint is that why not make all the way into shoes as well so that shoes doesn't have to come in pair anymore ? But seriously, some items are just imbalance, at least in my experience. You get lots and lots of weapons, armor, shoes, etc etc but i feel i don't get enough sash. Sometimes i think i am stuck with my equipment from the start until several acts in the future before i found the better replacement. But maybe that just me.   The visual of the character is pretty much like Warhammer 40k. So if you like Warhammer 40k homage, then you'll settle just right on. I definitely have no complaint on it. I just wish we get to have two handed gun, like riffle or something because we got handgun and bow&arrow while some enemy have sniper rifle on them. Now why is that ? And also, why not put crossbow as well ?   Overall, I recommended the game. Full disclosure, I got it on discount. I think it's worth it."
61347017,english,1,424370,"I have recently purchased the game. Haven't finished the 1st act yet but even now I am very happy with the game.   Graphics looks great although is the least important thing in games (imho). The game itself is very dynamic and although I don't have newest PC (i5  3.5GHz, 8GB Ram, GF 970) I have constantly 60fps.  I like skill tree which is similar to Path Of Exile one...although easier to manipulate and diverse your path. I very much like how you level spells and chose what modifications (increased damage, area, cooldown etc it should have) It let you modify it more to match your playing style.   The story is interesting although as I have mentioned I haven't finished whole 1st act yet it is very promising.   I love the idea of building own house...yes not the most important thing in Hack n Slash but I love the idea. It gives another reason to go and drop stuff  (and it reminds me good old Ultima Online).  There is no trading yet but I hope it will be implemented.  Only disadvantage I see is description of items...at least at the beginning.  There is no info about whether weapon is 1 or 2 handed which may be confusing a bit at first. Rating of items works differently to how I thought it should- sometimes 3 star item has worse stats than 2 star item. I found some information somewhere that it is not to compare items but to say how good rolls of stat on item are...not sure here really). Stats of items could be clearer.  There are small bits that needs fixing but overall I would highly recommend the game. Can't wait for the release day."
172231670,english,0,424370,They're shutting down the multiplayer functionality of the game instead of giving enough of a damn to give one last update for the game to run peer-to-peer or through some other method that doesn't require them hosting the servers themselves.  Don't make your multiplayer portion of your game entirely reliant on your own hosted servers if you don't know if you can host them indefinitely; it's practically worse than planned obsolescence.
90317210,english,1,424370,"Summery:  The game is absolutely playable and fun. I had 2 crashes within 120 hours of gameplay and a few minor bugs which didn’t bother me at all. It's an absolutely awesome looking and sounding ARPG with almost no limitations regarding character builds. I would totally recommend the game at its current state and price for all ARPG, H&S and RPG lovers.   Hint for Newcomers: Don’t give too much attention to the bad reviews. Most of them were disappointed bakers from the kickstarter project “Umbra”. Which is justifiable because they didn’t get what they payed for. But Wolcen is NOW a good looking completely fun ARPG. Don’t get confused by the two campaigns. Just use “Blood Trail”. It’s the same as the “Lords of Mayhem” campaign but without the bugs and including the improvements of the Blood Trail patch and the following patches. The “Lords of Mayhem” campaign is meant for old “legacy” characters only.  Hint for those who want to come back: Delete all characters which you had before the “Blood Trail” patch was released. Start from scratch with the “Blood Trail” campaign and enjoy. Since I did this: (almost) no issues during 120 hours of gameplay.  Pros: -	Dynamic gameplay -	Awesome graphics -	perfect sounds and sound design regarding positioning and quality -	no class limitations -	lots of skill variation possibilities -	well sized skill tree (wheel) -	almost infinite endgame -	the first real fireball I saw in an ARPG which is actually useful in the endgame ^^  Cons: -	linear level design -	not challenging except the boss fights -       the apocalyptic form is almost useless -	Endgame: o	becomes boring  by the time and there is no specific threat or super boss o	Not enough players for a random multiplayer session atm o	Repetitive expeditions/seats"
74096451,english,1,424370,"Overall a quite decent game with really nice graphics but not near complete with some minor to major bugs, alas I have faith that WOLCEN Studio will not disappoint in the long run.

63390281,english,1,424370,"I was dissappointed in my purchase of Wolcen in early access almost 2 years ago. But after setting it down and forgetting about it for a good long while, suddenly i was seeing videos pop up on youtube about all of the great changes happening to Wolcen and so I gave it another try.. Wow, have they come a long ways. I haven't had this much fun in an ARPG in a good long while, and now, a day before release and having seen all of the stuff they have planned for endgame, and moving forwards is outstanding.   The gameplay is the best part for me. The attacks feel ""weighty"" and very satisfying to use. I love the hybrid system that they have in place where I can use any combination of spells, physical attacks, ranged, attacks, etc to tailor my ""willpower dumping, rage generating, rage dumping, willpower generating"" cycling of gameplay. And that was the reason why i had so much fun leveling to 20. Whenever i found a new spell or powerful new weapon, I wasn't limited to the ""Class"" i had chosen or the playstyle i had used up till that point. I could very easily pivot and incorporate this new skill or item into my gameplay and completely switch things up. This kept things fun, fresh and interesting, and I can't wait to play the full game tomorrow :D  If you liked anything about the diablo franchise, torchlight, Path of Exile, titans quest, etc etc, definitely go watch some videos on Wolcen and give it a try. I can only speak for myself, but I have spent more hours in the Diablo games than any other (World of warcraft doesnt count, haha), and I absolutely loved my time in the beta.   Hope this helps, and good luck on your leveling journey to those of you who have already purchased the game :D"
46690896,english,1,424370,"i'm not exaggrating, this is the new diablo, wolcen take off where diablo 2 left off, not because of similarity, but because it is so damn satisfying to play this, AND the upcoming beta stuff is incredible, it will revamp the game quite noicely.  Why is this thing so good?  Everything in Wolcen is simply too fun to use, even the normal left click attacks are well made, and they have different combinations, like; pistol and sword, that's right you can actually do that, you can even get an upgrade called 'Titan' on the skill line and equip two-handed weapons as if they were one handed(yay! like in d2 barbar!), so you can use a two-handed giantass axe with a pistol like a steampunk knight it all looks so damn fine.  The glorious cryengine makes everything even better.  Entire thing looks so beautiful.  Wolcen is also super ambitious, currently it is officially known as singleplayer but the multi is in tech_beta which you can opt-in for it in the settings and try it with your friends, it obviously has bugs time to time but overall it's very promising.  Speaking of Tech_Beta, it is only for testing, it has limited gameplay, but, even with limited game the reworked spells, how they look, better looking weapons, bigger axes and stuff it all just looks so awesome..  Wolcen has a great future, and i genuinely think it will be the next Diablo 2. And in my opinion it is a great honor that many people think of wolcen as good as diablo 2 was.   Edit: Well, this aged poorly."
188136894,english,0,952070,"Resistance is a 4v1 multiplayer game set in the Resident Evil universe where players need to work together as they try to escape different scenarios, all the while the Mastermind player attempts to stop them by deploying traps and enemies. In theory this game certainly had potential, however in execution there is a lot left to be desired. Issues with balancing are blatant, with some characters and masterminds being a lot more useful than others, often creating unevenness in matches. The game itself is very repetitive, as the objectives don't vary all that much. Matchmaking is generally atrocious. The player base never really caught on so finding a match can take ages and often when you do, there are loads of cheaters that suck whatever enjoyment remains. Capcom seems to have pretty much abandoned support for it at this point. Give this title a miss, even if you're a big fan of the RE series."

Yet level design is a luckluster, I don't know how difficult it is to make balanced and yet captivated locations so I might be wrong in this, but they definitely could make it better and more memorable. Not even a single stage impressed me, yet almost all of them have some parts of the stage that I really like.  Music and sounds, overall pretty good, more or less memorable music, well delivered lines by masterminds and survivors, good-decent sounds on everything else.  Gameplay - four survivors vs mastermind, while survivors try to make an objective and escape from stage, mastermind tries to stop them with everything they got. Doesn't sound all to great on paper, but actually might be a lot of fun. Why ""might"" be you ask? First of all P2P connection, you might be from UK while you opponent will be from japan, but sometimes it will feel like he is from Saturn. Because its P2P you will find yourself playing against some ""pluggers"", you got fine/tolerable connection in stage 1 and terrible at stage 3, up to forced disconnect. And of course we got cheaters, there is not that much of them (because there is not that much players) but they are here. There is some veterans in the game, not to mention they know the game in and out unlike you, they also got all abilities and perks/equipment unlocked which puts you into serious disadvantage. The last one is balance, I didn't play this game as long as others, but it feels survivors are in favour, 4 survivor veterans will pulvaryze veteran mastermind, IF one of them will be unlucky, ""how is that?"" the thing is when you choose your survivor/mastermind you don't know who you will play against and won't make a hard counterpick.Although I said I enjoyed it, It wasn't very intresting to play as survivor, yet playing as mastermind was quite enjoyable for me.  I hope RESISTANCE 2 will come out someday (it probably won't), because I do see a potential in the game, but you need to put more effort and faith in this project Capcom ."

It seems to rely on peer 2 peer and often hosts will end up having horrid connection and the compensation for the delays is poor to say the least. I have seen players in my games as well as the enemies end up glitching through doors and rooms and other characters and it makes it hard to understand what is even happening in the game at that point.

191349167,english,1,952070,"I got this as part of the Resident Evil Remake Trilogy, and I've been having so much fun I haven't even started RE2, RE3, or RE4.  It's my first asymmetrical horror survival game, and I am really loving it. I never got interested in Dead by Daylight because it seems to me like a hodgepodge of different IPs rather than having a single defining one, and I was never into Friday the 13th. I was interested in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it never came to Game Pass for PC in my region. I say this because I'm not into paying retail prices for live service games. RE Resistance, on the other hand, I got as part of a bundle, and I like how it's asymmetrical horror survival/escape based on the Resident Evil franchise.  I love the characters (currently learning Becca and Tyrone as survivor and Alex as mastermind) and how there is a lot to learn in how to play them and the variety of play styles that are possible. Teammates have mostly been pretty good, although like a third to half the time one guy leaves (it's 4v1) during the match. Skill level varies quite a bit among players and per game, so although there are some games where your team is stunlocked and you lose to the mastermind, they're balanced out by the ones where you feel like it's very doable. It's also interesting to see how skilled players make characters like Valerie and Jill look super OP. Matchmaking is adequate--I can find a match most of the time I try to connect, but there are occasionally times when no one else seems to be playing. Also, most matches are fine in terms of connection stability, but there is the occasional match where I'm lagging quite a bit and die easily and some where I just lose connection.  Aside from the gameplay which I am really enjoying, I really like the progression system. As you play and rank up your characters (it's on a per character basis), you unlock new skills and gain RP which you can spend to unlock random items and cosmetics. These allow you to customize your characters' builds so that you feel like your characters become more capable the more you play. Also, there are daily and weekly mission for getting more RP and cosmetics chests just like in other live service games.  At the moment, this, as well as Dragon's Dogma 2 and to a lesser extent Elden Ring, are the games I'm playing the most right now, so I would definitely say this is one of my go-to games, and I highly recommend it."

178240232,english,1,952070,"Resident Evil Resistance : By Triple F  ""Resident Evil Resistance"" is an asymmetrical multiplayer game bundled with ""Resident Evil 3"" Remake in 2020, designed as a standalone experience that reimagines survival horror in a cooperative online format. This entry pits four Survivors against a single player-controlled Mastermind in various environments that players must navigate and escape. The game’s core premise is innovative for the franchise, introducing a multiplayer format where each role offers a distinct style of play: Survivors work together to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and reach the exit, while the Mastermind sets traps, spawns monsters, and strategically disrupts the players’ plans. Although ""Resident Evil Resistance"" delivers a refreshing take on multiplayer survival horror, it presents a mixed experience, balancing strong gameplay ideas with areas that fall short of their potential.  The Survivors' gameplay is designed around cooperation, with each character specializing in unique skills to encourage teamwork. The playable characters include a hacker, a medic, a tank, and a damage dealer, each bringing valuable skills that, when combined effectively, allow the group to progress and survive. For example, January can hack surveillance cameras to temporarily limit the Mastermind’s view, while Valerie provides healing support for the team. These specialized roles create a sense of interdependence, as players must work together to overcome obstacles and make it through each of the game’s three stages. However, the effectiveness of this cooperative play largely depends on the communication and skill level of the players involved, which can lead to frustration in public matchmaking when teamwork falls apart.  In contrast, the Mastermind gameplay offers a distinctly different experience, focusing on strategy and resource management. Playing as the Mastermind is reminiscent of a dungeon master role: one must anticipate the Survivors’ moves, placing traps, spawning enemies, and using environmental elements to delay or injure them. Mastermind players can choose between various iconic villains like Annette Birkin, Daniel Fabron, and Alex Wesker, each with unique abilities and access to certain types of enemies. Annette, for instance, can summon the fearsome G-Birkin, while Alex can use traps and powerful creatures to stall players. This role has a steep learning curve, but it provides a highly strategic experience where every choice matters, making it particularly rewarding for players who enjoy tactical gameplay. However, the Mastermind's abilities can sometimes feel overpowered, leading to a lopsided experience that can frustrate the Survivors.  Level design plays a significant role in creating atmosphere, with locations inspired by classic ""Resident Evil"" settings like research facilities, labs, and prison blocks. Each map is layered with elements that keep players alert, such as dark hallways, limited visibility, and frequent dead ends. While these environments capture the claustrophobic horror fans expect, they also create bottlenecks that the Mastermind can exploit heavily, making navigation particularly challenging. The design tends to favor the Mastermind’s traps and ambushes, giving them an advantage as they control the layout through surveillance cameras and deployed enemies. This dynamic can occasionally lead to a sense of unfairness for the Survivor team, as the Mastermind can take advantage of certain chokepoints that are difficult to avoid.  Combat mechanics and resource scarcity add another layer of tension to the gameplay, but they’re balanced differently for each role. Survivors are limited in resources and must carefully choose when to fight, avoid, or even flee. Ammunition, healing items, and weapons are scattered throughout the levels, forcing players to plan ahead and make tough decisions on resource allocation. This scarcity aligns well with the traditional ""Resident Evil"" feel, but when paired with an overwhelming Mastermind, it can become frustrating for Survivors who are quickly outmatched. Mastermind players, on the other hand, have a steady supply of resources at their disposal, which allows them to keep the pressure on the Survivors without significant limitations. This disparity can be exhilarating for the Mastermind but disheartening for Survivors, especially when faced with repeated enemy waves.  One area where ""Resident Evil Resistance"" shines is in its atmosphere and sound design. True to the franchise, it utilizes eerie music, sudden audio cues, and ambient sounds to create a palpable sense of dread. When navigating the dark, narrow corridors as a Survivor, every creak, growl, and footstep contributes to the tension, giving the sense that danger is lurking around every corner. For the Mastermind, the sound design offers useful cues that signal where Survivors are located, adding a layer of immersion and helping them strategize in real-time. The consistent quality of these audio elements helps to enhance the horror experience, despite the game’s action-oriented multiplayer focus.  In terms of progression and replay-ability, ""Resident Evil Resistance"" offers character progression systems and unlockable cosmetics, allowing players to level up and personalize their characters as they continue to play. Each Survivor and Mastermind can unlock new abilities and perks, providing incentives to continue playing and improving. However, the lack of significant narrative depth and limited map variety mean that the gameplay loop can feel repetitive over time, especially for those looking for a more story-driven experience typical of ""Resident Evil."" This focus on progression as the main motivator for replay-ability works well for multiplayer fans but may fail to engage players looking for a longer-lasting or more immersive single-player experience.  All in all, ""Resident Evil Resistance"" brings an innovative approach to the ""Resident Evil"" franchise with its asymmetrical multiplayer format, offering a fresh experience for fans willing to embrace cooperative and competitive gameplay. The unique dynamic between Survivors and Mastermind players keeps each match unpredictable, but the imbalance between roles, lack of narrative elements, and occasional design issues can lead to frustration. For players who enjoy strategy, teamwork, and a new take on survival horror, ""Resident Evil Resistance"" delivers a worthwhile, if sometimes uneven, experience that shows Capcom’s willingness to experiment within the franchise. While it may not be for everyone, ""Resident Evil Resistance"" offers an intriguing multiplayer spin that expands the boundaries of ""Resident Evil"" in unexpected ways."
166119018,english,1,952070,"Honestly a really fun time with friends, but due to an inactive playerbase - good luck on getting a match with anyone these days. Which is a shame, but sometimes that's just the way things go. At least it was a free extra that came along with the RE3 remake.  That said, if you have a group of friends who all have the RE3 remake; you can easily get a full lobby together for some fun."
192282687,english,0,952070,"[h1] [b] [i] More experimental than Re:Verse, still doomed to fail [/i] [/b] [/h1]  [h1] [b] [i] ★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆ [/i] [/b] [/h1]  Resistance was/is Capcom's first proper foray into the Resident Evil multiplayer realm – and I'm not going to lie, it was an interesting one. Instead of the lazy, uninspired slop that formed years later with Re:Verse, Resistance seemingly had a lot going for it, at least on paper. Resident Evil's theme is practically made for some kind of asymmetric multiplayer, where it is monster's vs survivors or, as Resistance presents it, ""masterminds"" vs escapees. It is a fairly complex idea that, in many ways, is realized well, but ultimately, it follows the same fate as its younger brother, Re:Verse - being abandoned and forgotten soon after release.   [h1] [i] “I have many fun adventures lined up for you.  We have death, destruction, disease, all of the fun things that the modern world will offer us.” [/i] [/h1]  Unlike the Re:Verse, which simply cashed in out creating an asset mush from previous game made into a bare-bones asymmetric multiplayer deathmatches, Resistance instead went for true asymmetry with four players assuming the roles of unwilling test subjects who have to overcome obstacles and escape Umbrella testing facilities while one other player becomes a ""Mastermind"", or an operator who observes the survivors escaping through cameras and tries to prevent them from doing so using a variety of ingenious traps, monsters, and other utilities. That is where I feel Resistance greatest strength lies - whereas the survivors play in much of the same way as the Resident Evil Remakes (albeit in a more arcade-y way), the Mastermind offers a truly unique experience that I've personally not seen repeated anywhere else. After you select  one of the known RE universe villains, you'll get changing selection of ""cards"" you can play out which can be anything from simple landmines all the way to summoning Nemesis. You can then choose to be either reactionary and place it around the survivors as they progress, or be more proactive and tactical and prepare the spaces they are going to have to enter eventually.  Not only that, but you can also take things into your hand and become a more active participant in the battle by taking control of any creature you have summoned. Mastermind is where the game truly excels as the 4 different survivors and the endless combinations of cards and abilities offer unlimited outcomes that can come into place. So why not recommend it?  Despite Resistance being the only active full-on multiplayer game that still works and is not planning to be shutdown (well, apart from maybe Umbrella Corps) as it relies on peer-to-peer connections (meaning it might survive long into the future), the fact still is that Capcom abandoned the game not long after its release without adding much content. Resistance was initially supposed to have a single-player campaign, which would have been amazing (imagine having a story mode for the Mastermind mode), but this was ultimately scrapped. What you've got is a game with incredibly interesting concept but very little to actually keep you engaged past a couple of hours after which the novelty wears off and you are just feeling underwhelmed because you understand what could have been if this game got the love it deserved. The lack of support also nowadays directly translates to no one playing this game as there no reason two, so as a newcomer, you will be hard-pressed to find any online matches. Additionally, since the single-player content boils down to just practice mode with survivors, which is fine, and stripped-down Mastermind mode where the AI for the survivors is always turned off so you can even experience a basic version of the match.   There is simply nothing that you are looking for that you'd find in this particular game nowadays. While you can't buy it directly anymore, it is still bundled with some Resident Evil bundles, so you might think it would be a good idea to give this a shot - don't, cause it's not.   [h2] [b] [u] Positives & Negatives [/u] [/b] [/h2]  [table] [tr] 	[th][b] [i] Positives [/i] [/b][/th] 	[th][b] [i] Negatives [/i] [/b][/th] [/tr] [tr] 	[td]+ Decent survivor gameplay copying most of the mechanics from the Remakes and adding an arcade spin on it with abilities and skills[/td] 	[td]- Graphically inferior to the previous RE Engine titles[/td] [/tr] [tr] 	[td]+ Amazing idea with the ""Mastermind"" role and pretty functional execution[/td] 	[td]- Abandoned - not receiving any updates anymore or being sold[/td] [/tr] [tr] 	[td]+ Plenty of unlockables[/td] 	[td]- Severe lack of players [/td] [/tr] [tr] 	[td]+ Good map design[/td] 	[td]- Ultimately becomes repetitive and boring way too fast[/td] [/tr] [tr] 	[td][/td] 	[td]- Supported only for a couple of years, which translates to a lack of any meaningful content[/td] [/tr] [tr] 	[td][/td] 	[td][/td] [/tr] [/table]"

I truly have no idea why they were so blind to what they had on their hands. This game is great for streaming and watching as well. Sadly the poor reviews reflect everyone's frustrations with how the game was handled and it's abandonment, rather than the quality of the underlying game, so Capcom probably thinks it was a dud.

Maybe some hacks existed, the purpose of it is just doing a one key press to stop the time movement of Survivors, lol this did sound better And it had a perfect cut timing of the hilarious line on my screen ""Mastermind (Opp)'s connection to the lobby is weak"". After the line disappeared, this is the moment he just spawned a stronger zombie under my legs and pushed my out of bounds and made my character awake. What a wild game of how deep hacks can breach into this broken game - the guessing game of who's sus now This sounded like i am so late for the game, because those Chinese comments in 2020 also stated those similar hacks of freezing players and making players lag.

170649936,english,1,952070,"[h1] A Thrilling Asymmetrical Experience! [/h1] [h2] Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) [/h2]    Resident Evil Resistance is a fantastic addition to the Resident Evil franchise, providing a fresh and exhilarating twist on traditional gameplay. As an asymmetrical multiplayer game, it pits four survivors against one master mind, and the tension in each match is palpable!  The gameplay mechanics are well-designed, allowing for strategic planning and teamwork amongst survivors. Each character has unique abilities that contribute to the group's success, and finding synergies within the team adds a layer of depth to the experience. On the other side, playing as the mastermind is incredibly satisfying! It’s thrilling to set traps, control monsters, and thwart the survivors' escape attempts.  The maps are beautifully crafted and filled with classic Resident Evil elements, providing a nostalgic feel for longtime fans while still feeling fresh. The game perfectly balances suspense and action, ensuring that you’re always on the edge of your seat.  Additionally, the progression system is rewarding. Unlocking new characters and abilities keeps the gameplay engaging and encourages you to try different playstyles. The community is also vibrant, making it easy to find matches and connect with other players.  In summary, Resident Evil Resistance delivers an intense multiplayer experience that combines horror, strategy, and teamwork. If you’re a fan of the series or just love multiplayer games, I highly recommend giving it a shot!    [b] -You’re all going to die here! [/b]"

192840158,english,0,952070,"🎮 Resident Evil: Resistance 🧟‍♂️ The multiplayer experience that makes you wish you were still playing RE6…  Playtime: 5 hours (4.5 spent in matchmaking)  Recommended: ❌ Only if you enjoy pain, frustration, and getting matched with 3 randoms who have absolutely no idea what they're doing.  So I dove into Resistance, hoping for a fun, tactical experience. You know, surviving together in the terrifying world of Resident Evil, fighting zombies, and fighting a crazy mastermind who traps you in puzzles. What did I get?  Absolute chaos. And not the good kind.  🧠 Gameplay? • Survivor mode: Five people trying to escape, but one of them is more concerned about looting than actually… escaping • Mastermind mode: Feel like a puppet master? Nah, more like a toddler with a random toybox full of broken ideas • Get stuck in a corner because your teammates think hitting “use item” is a team effort.  🔑 Objectives? ""Hey, let’s all solve this puzzle!"" Meanwhile, someone’s running around in circles trying to shoot zombies with a knife 🔪 Or worse: ""Let’s escape!"" Survivors get distracted by ammo crates and forget to actually escape 🧃  👾 Matchmaking I waited 20 minutes to get into a match… only to get kicked immediately after I loaded in because someone decided they wanted to play something else 😡  💀 The Mastermind: I get it, you're the villain, but I can’t even tell if you’re a mastermind or just a dude pressing buttons randomly  Place a zombie? ✅  Place a trap? ✅  Hit the “what’s happening” button? Also ✅, but for no reason  🧠 Final Thoughts: This game is like trying to assemble IKEA furniture with no instructions and the occasional zombie jumping out of the box to bite your face off. It’s clunky, frustrating, and just feels… unfinished. Like they had a cool idea, but then decided to do everything wrong.  👍 10/10 would rather be playing Tetris ❌ Never again. 🎮 #Resistance 🔥🧟‍♂️💥 (Me running into a room and hoping for better teammates, but nope, it’s all bad)"

74572924,english,1,952070,"I had been having so much fun with this game, and I started to get tired of it by the fourth or fifth month, playing every single night. It still is extremely thrilling to play with friends and very challenging to play randomly. It's great to play as all the characters, who have fully-realised concepts, by the way. I love their voice lines and backstories. The game had monthly updates, but it was over by November. The mechanics and graphics are better than ever for the franchise, although there are stressful moments like zombies chain-grabbing you in a small area or several dogs and lickers jumping at you non-stop... But as a fan, I do enjoy it.  Playing as Mastermind is quite amusing as well... There's something evil about cornering survivors with waves of buffed creatures, locking doors behind them and laying traps on the stairs and watching them fall for them. There's something thrilling about playing Spencer and saying ""I'm doing this for humanity... Humanity needs me as a God. Don't you agree?""  However, there are serious issues with this game, the biggest being the absence of dedicated servers and anti-cheat system, as well as how unbalanced it feels in the beginning. By playing it, I did get frustrated a lot coming across Masterminds (which are the villains, and ironically, the hosts of the matches) who either cheat or have terrible network connections, making the match lag so hard that I have seen zombie dogs fly. In the beginning, you might want to quit this game for good because it is so unfair for players without any experience since you will have a hard time trying to go up against death squads (if you play as the MM) or well-prepared villains (if you play as the survivors), all levelled up at high ranks and full of stuff at their disposal while you have nothing (nearly nothing).  Apart from that, the game is really cool, and I love the costumes available in-game for free as well. Such a shame many people don't recognise the potential of this entry and it pains me to see such an amazing game die so quickly."
67794752,english,1,952070,"In short, the game is good and have a lot of potential, but if the problems remains unresolved then the game will be dead quickly.

[/b]  [b] 1: [/b] Almost each game, you can have 4 survivors ""rank"" 4-8 versus a mastermind ""rank"" 56 vice versa. So, new players survivors or mastermind get beaten easily and remove the postive experience for new players. This problem would be my number 1 priority before adding new contents.  [b] 2: [/b] Having a P2P connection instead of dedicated servers increase lag with the host (Mastermind). It can be trivial, but it generate the opportunity to use lag switch and possibly other cheating system. Personal experience : I've play against more than twenty lag switcher (to give you an order of magnitude, I don't even count anymore) and one cheater who wipe our entire party instantly from nowhere. An additional difficulty is that the connection for REsistance make it difficult to report cheater because you need to find the players manualy instead of using ""View->Players"".  A few more points to work on : [olist]     [*] [b] Resolve [/b] door exploit -> Close door spam which you can't enter without consequences      [*] [b] Resolve [/b] stun locked from zombies claws or Mr. X punches     [*] [b] Resolve [/b] impossibility to interrupt an animation (Claws, Grab, etc.) with a crowd control (Tyrone kick, Sam punch, etc.), therefore the animation is immune to all counter.     [*] [b] Resolve [/b] camera fixed for 3-5 sec when you fall on the ground, which make it really difficult to turn during that time.     [*] [b] Resolve [/b] vaccum effect from zombie when they want to grab you.     [*] [b] Review [/b] hitbox of G-Barkin attacks.     [*] [b] Review [/b] all the exploits.

This game was so fresh and brand new, the perfect Resident Evil themed multiplayer, lots of grind and almost the perfect competition to dbd... But if Capcom doesn't give updates, dedicated servers or anticheats, less people will care. If you call a peak of 60 players per month playing Re Resistance a playerbase, then this game is well dead, thank you Capcom for not even trying to keep up, the same thing will happen to Re:verse.

The game only received updates for six months.  Does anybody [i]actually[/i] like that type of model? Stop releasing multiplayer spin-offs tied to some other purchase. Stop releasing multiplayer games with a live-service model only to stop updating them after 6 months. Commit and have faith in your product.

Its restricted availability and scapegoated existence make it look unappealing. These games are [i]fine[/i] on their own – they don't need to be attached together.

This is such a fun game. The core game idea is great, it meshes well with the franchise it uses (without needing to rely solely on the license either!), and it had ample room to grow both its preexisting mechanics and potential for new ideas.

Cons - No official servers, means peer to peer connection, meaning horrible lag in almost every game, and game can end if host is losing and decides to leave the match. Almost no players on PC.

188136894,english,0,952070,"Resistance is a 4v1 multiplayer game set in the Resident Evil universe where players need to work together as they try to escape different scenarios, all the while the Mastermind player attempts to stop them by deploying traps and enemies. In theory this game certainly had potential, however in execution there is a lot left to be desired. Issues with balancing are blatant, with some characters and masterminds being a lot more useful than others, often creating unevenness in matches. The game itself is very repetitive, as the objectives don't vary all that much. Matchmaking is generally atrocious. The player base never really caught on so finding a match can take ages and often when you do, there are loads of cheaters that suck whatever enjoyment remains. Capcom seems to have pretty much abandoned support for it at this point. Give this title a miss, even if you're a big fan of the RE series."

Many MMs are laggy. I don't know whether it is because the area is too far away, the server is faulty, or the MM got internet problem. XD Anyway I like this game very much as a biohazard fan but I don't recommend to play it. : (  2023.04.17 added: This game is literally broken by bots, you cannot find matches as MM in random. If you are a veteran and planning for a return, I suggest you to go for custom. There are some static people playing custom games every day but it's kinda hard to level up due to the point you earn from custom is really low. Rookie? I suggest you go find something else to play.  如果是国人的话，野排已经死了。建议加我好友拉你进开黑群，人够了一般会发车玩自定义，也能体验这个游戏，不过自定义给的经验很少，很难升级，对新人很不友好。"

Sometimes there's lag too which can be a problem, but this game is still in its early stages and they have fixed a lot since it's release!   I've put in over 1,000 hours into this game and I still love it! I find the reviews this game has right now unfair personally. Find yourself a team too, you'll have a better time!

The hardest part is the beginning because many people are experienced and skill difference is high between new players and veterans, but once you get to know the basics its really fun. The only downside is the absence of dedicated servers, p2p connection makes games for survivors often laggy, because of the small playerbase its likely that Mastermind(who is host) is far away in the world. The playerbase is small but is very active, so you always find matches between 1-5 minutes usually, if you select Random in Quick Match. The only blame should not be given to this game but Capcom who did not give this game the treatment it deserved, this game has a lot of wasted potential."
191466572,english,1,952070,"5/10 - I don't know even who is the audience for this game, but unexpectadly I enjoyed it!  Received this game as a bonus for Resident Evil 3 remake pre-order, never cared about it and never planned to play it, but since then I start grinding for achivs. Heard that the games servers will be shut down in summer, so I assumed it's time to play it now or never.  Visually it's what you saw in RE2RE and RE3RE - a good looking game. Yet level design is a luckluster, I don't know how difficult it is to make balanced and yet captivated locations so I might be wrong in this, but they definitely could make it better and more memorable. Not even a single stage impressed me, yet almost all of them have some parts of the stage that I really like.  Music and sounds, overall pretty good, more or less memorable music, well delivered lines by masterminds and survivors, good-decent sounds on everything else.  Gameplay - four survivors vs mastermind, while survivors try to make an objective and escape from stage, mastermind tries to stop them with everything they got. Doesn't sound all to great on paper, but actually might be a lot of fun. Why ""might"" be you ask? First of all P2P connection, you might be from UK while you opponent will be from japan, but sometimes it will feel like he is from Saturn. Because its P2P you will find yourself playing against some ""pluggers"", you got fine/tolerable connection in stage 1 and terrible at stage 3, up to forced disconnect. And of course we got cheaters, there is not that much of them (because there is not that much players) but they are here. There is some veterans in the game, not to mention they know the game in and out unlike you, they also got all abilities and perks/equipment unlocked which puts you into serious disadvantage. The last one is balance, I didn't play this game as long as others, but it feels survivors are in favour, 4 survivor veterans will pulvaryze veteran mastermind, IF one of them will be unlucky, ""how is that?"" the thing is when you choose your survivor/mastermind you don't know who you will play against and won't make a hard counterpick.Although I said I enjoyed it, It wasn't very intresting to play as survivor, yet playing as mastermind was quite enjoyable for me.  I hope RESISTANCE 2 will come out someday (it probably won't), because I do see a potential in the game, but you need to put more effort and faith in this project Capcom ."
85457326,english,0,952070,"If you are a newby DON'T play in this game. Matchmaking is an absolute joke. For example you start as Mastermind Rank 1 and the game puts survivors Rank 100 against you. Or as Survivor Rank 1 you get to fight Mastermind Rank 100. And there are literally only 100 people playing this game daily. I suppose the game had bigger online in spring 2020, but now it's dead. The sad thing is that I think the RE:SISTANCE is pretty fun. The gameplay is interesting and it's fun to play this kind of game  in the RE Universe. But I really can’t feel good about it right now. So take my advice, if you just bought Resident Evil 3, don't bother yourself even downloading RE:SISTANCE. Save your time and disc space on your PC."
139326727,english,0,952070,"[h1] Review[/h1]  Since RE3 was such a short game for a semi-full price game adding some sort of Multiplayer is definitely not a bad idea if the multiplayer is actually fun an interesting. RE5 and 6 had a much longer game and shipped or later on added various multiplayer coop or vs modes. This one goes the hardest route I can imagine: asymmetrical gameplay in a pvp environment.  [u]Gameplay[/u] Here is the kicker. I cannot really describe the gameplay because you cannot play the game anymore. Not only is the player base low but also, aside private matches, public matchmaking is not possible. Its necessary for unlocking cosmetics or abilities and permanent modifications.   Matchmaking is not possible as the player who is the Mastermind will most of the time get a glitched lobby. I´ve been told that the reason for that is the hacks of someone. Bots will directly try to join a Masterminds lobby and immediately leave and rejoin or some weird stuff like that. So, in 2 hours of searching, I managed to find (my) premade group as the mastermind twice.  The core gameplay is as far as I can see not actually that bad. You have four survivor with various abilities and playstyles and a mastermind who tries to kill or damage the player and thus lowering the time they have to escape. The game has three stages, first a key/puzzle piece hunt, then a keycard hunt where the person who has the keycard has to interact with various terminals and at last you have to destroy three power cores to escape. A game usually takes around 10-20 minutes.  The mastermind places traps and monsters depending on a complex card and resource system. He also has to use cameras whom can be shot. I cannot say really how balanced it is but I doubt it is balanced in any way aside playing it very casually. If people remember the camera positions or pick characters that are op (I heard certain survivors make certain masterminds obsolete, characters like Jill or Becca are very often picked. Mastermind Nikolai also seems hated as he solely works by spamming traps and trying to shoot down a survivor with a camera gun when he cannot move.  [u]Story[/u] None, just random villains and aside Jill who got added later on there are survivors created just for this game.   [u]Sound[/u] From an absolute banger of a main menu theme towards more environmental songs that step up in certain situations this game got it all. Really great ost that doesn’t have to hide from the rest of the franchise. Even got voice acting in a couple of languages too!  [u]Graphics[/u] While it does take the same style and graphics of RE2/3 there is a downgrade. It does have a few interesting animations, especially in melee combat with various zombie finisher, it does have a worse quality. Probably got downgraded due to the online portion.  [u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u] All in all playing a few rounds with friends was really fun. There are a lot of problems with this mode, being unplayable at the moment wasn’t its final nail in the coffin. Bad balancing for a game system like that it had a lack of support from the developer and I also heard, aside the currently hacked lobbies, that people back then managed to solely hack the game with cheat engine. Yeah no wonder it died directly.  Broken and dead multiplayer game"
67754177,english,0,952070,"As a matter of fact, I had to force myself to meditate and calm down before exploding in anger in the course of writing this review. why did I bother to write this review? maybe I wanted to complain about what made me feel uncomfortable; thus I could feel better.  The game is set in the in vivo experiment base with human beings by Umbrellas. The game rules are simple: the experimenter tries to stop survivors from escaping, and the survivors try to escape with using their resources.  The characters have their own skills and have to crate well-organized strategies so that they will escape from the grasp of the villain experimenter. The game plays under this big framework.  At a glance, it may feel like a survival game, like Dead by Daylight, but it deserves praise for its differentiating elements, including high quality graphic and character design.  There is nothing more to be desired in the game as long as the overall package is concerned. ""survivors work together to create a strategy and fight against experimenter with their own strategies."" A wonderful development of story is anticipated like a beautiful painting. A closer look at its various aspects, however, will reveal that the game is full of problems to which any game enthusiasts would shake their heads.  If only those who love Resident Evil play this game, the small-sized users will not matter. When cheating is prevalent among users, however, things are different. The number of users are already small for this game, but players who cheat extort common users and smile an evil smile behind of a screen. just thinking of this possibility can make disappoint who have been excited to play the game.  If you come across players whose IDs Start with ***, seven in ten cases will turn out to be cheaters. If they are experimenters, you will face endless bombardment by machine guns with numerous zombies around.  The next problem I would lie to point out concerns the network. when the host network is unstable, the players on the surviving side will experience such inconvenience that their game environment becomes uncomfortable. This game only has a small of users. If its host network is unstable you will experience more than simple game play; you will find yourself sitting helpless while vacantly looking at the bloody red monitor after getting beaten by the host experimenter while not being able to do anything.  When you come across cheaters, who usually play on the experimenter side and have IDs starting with ***, there is a big possibility that they are Chinese. Even if there is no cheating, users on the experimenter side are asked o practice a high level of control. Since cheaters can pour out the abilities of an experimenter with no limits, they must prefer the experimenter role for convenience.  I came across a Chinese player that overused cheats and was subjected to no restrictions. I can imagine them deceiving and mocking other honest users and smiling wickedly behind their anonymous ID starting with *** while continuing to cheat right at that moment. You will get a bonus, too, which is their mockery of the manager's inability and celebration of great China.  I feel bad thinking of some players around the world getting tormented by cheaters on resident Evil. My biggest concern is that there is nothing to console the users that were tormented by cheaters and left the game as no media or means of communications has criticized these cheating players.  Can we expect a game culture of respecting and treating those who do play fair with no tricks and deception in this game? If you come across an experimenter and feel suspicious you'd better log out of game and pray that you will not get a match with this Chinese player next time."
156994774,english,0,952070,"This game has potential, but like what other reviews have said, without dedicated server, Mastermind is always the host, thus they can lag switch so survivors can't do anything but to lose.   If you are new, winning as Mastermind is impossible without equipment, and you get matched with high level survivors with equipment who have been playing for years.  There are only handful of active players, after playing for a few hours, you can remember their names and know who is the lag switchers, and who is the toxic teammate blocking objective with items or not getting into gate for next area. Some are online every day because they lag switch to make sure they win when they start losing, there is no point playing against them.  And also, low player count means half your time is playing queue simulator.  In summary, it might be fun for the first few games, but don't even download this, it will waste your time."

82639255,english,1,952070,"Resident Evil Resistance is to say the least, a beautiful monstrosity. In nearly every way possible, this game was strangled, chained for death, and left abandoned, yet there are still many who hold on because there is still so much potential in this game. Despite the plentiful issues, player base toxicity, lag, hacking, questionable design choices, OP Survivor/ Mastermind builds, over-reliance of RNG in mechanics, and lack of teamwork (On and on), there is still so much enjoyment to be had in this game; But alas, that one good game every so often that makes all the absolutely terrible rounds in between worthwhile, is becoming rarer and rarer.  Everyone has known since day one that it should have been sold separately. That one caveat to getting this game immensely hindered its growth. Even without Dedicated Servers, at least there would have been a steady starting player base and coupled with a lesser price for entry, and months of updates, laggy games would have been less frequent, as there would have possibly been more local people to play with which would aid overall enjoyment. As the player base dwindles the games have to reach further and further for players which exacerbates the games lag, as well as it's many flaws. It's truly a vicious cycle. This issue was made even more troublesome when the updates stopped coming and everyone dropped ship, due to heartbreak and the ever worsening state of the game.  Also, I gotta say, this game's store page is absolutely abysmal, the lone 5 pre-released pictures and the all red Recent/All Review Ratings expedited, and was a product of, its ever-increasing irrelevance and popular decline which is sad to see. From the get-go this game is niche, survival horror and especially an Outbreak/Mercenaries style game was a risk, but despite all that, they somehow made a compelling and fun experience. The game's identity problem, lack of direction and faith in the work really shows with how its left in its currently state. If a stranger somehow stumbled on this games store page without any prior knowledge, I highly doubt they would think under all that mediocrity that there is actually a great game laying neglected underneath.  Resistance has made me feel many strong emotions. May they be of pure anger and frustration from constant terrible solo-que matches, bliss and euphoria from a difficult but ever rewarding close game, or simply joy from the little things that make each game played unique and fun. Resistance is amazing, it's my ugly duckling and I love it to pieces. But those that feel similarly know of the deep sadness and just disappointment seeing the game withering away every week to only disappear into obscurity.  Despite the many flaws justly criticized by the player base, I do truly recommend this game because I know there are others out there like me, while knowing and experiencing its shortcomings, that will still find joy and a fulfilling challenge. It's just very unfortunate that this game is left as it is, it could have been so very fruitful if it was given a chance. No wonder why the player base is so morose, divided and spent."

67205347,english,1,952070,"[h1][b]Introduction[/b][/h1] «Resident Evil: Resistance» is an asymmetrical-multiplayer set in the world of Resident Evil. It has developed by «Capcom» in association with «NeoBards Entertainment».  The game has been announcement on «Tokyo Game Show» 2019 and meet negative feedback. As expected, some people was dissatisfied the fact that «Capcom» create project like this instead of «Resident Evil: Outbreak: File 3» or just remake of «Resident Evil: Outbreak». As answer on this situation «Capcom» with announce of «Resident Evil 3» declared that «Resident Evil: Resistance» will be a part of the game.  Also, «Resident Evil: Resistance» has an open-beta in a period from 23rd of March until 3rd of April. [h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1] As dictated by this genre, concept of this game is a resistance of one person with survivors (1 vs. 4). This game divided on two different modes: survivor and mastermind, which one is differ each other a lot.  There are two different objectives of these modes. The survivors have to escape before time runs out, while mastermind ought to prevent them from escaping.  There are six different survivors which have unique skills that they have to use to cover each other and defeat creatures together.  Also, there are four different masterminds, which one of them have unique creatures and special weapon helps them to prevent survivors escape. [h1][b]Visuals[/b][/h1]  This game uses «RE Engine». Regardless of low system requirements, graphics looks great, there are a lot of different options and cinematic effects. As for a cursory glance the game looks more clearly than RE3. Also, optimization of the game is good just like other games on that engine.  The design of the maps looks awesome. Incredible attention to the details. [h1][b]Sound[/b][/h1] Suddenly, the composer of the game is Jeff Broadbent. Everything sounds great like it should be. Especially strands out the main theme.  Also there are a few mixes of tracks from the previous games, and they sounds great in environment of the game. [h1][b]The verdict[/b][/h1]  «Resident Evil: Resistance» is a great example of modern today online games, without any objective but extremely fun. It has great potential. It’s has everything it needs to the popular online game. There are a lot of great choices in the balance of the game, but it's not enough. There is room for improvement. It needs long support.  An indicated list of the issues to be resolved, in my humble opinion: 1) Dedicated servers; 2) Matchmaking improvements; 3) Balance improving, refinement; 4) Some sort of anti-cheat; 5) Cross-platform play."
140614279,english,0,952070,not good bad awfully bad i dont even see a point to say why it's bad burn this game with umbrella corps and resident evil survivor cds
120425824,english,0,952070,"saw this on my list and it reminded me i will never forgive capcom for shooting this game dead lol  my favourite horror asym game but i cannot in good consciousness recommend it because of how terribly it was handled. this thing had no chance. it was marketed so poorly that it was judged on the basis of it ""taking time/budget away from re3r"" and hated for that reason despite it having nothing to do with that game, just arbitrarily bundled with it. you cant buy this thing separately and to this day this steam page is still hidden (??????). horribly unbalanced in all manner of ways and incredibly unintuitive for new players. they failed to patch a lot of its problems out in a timely manner and as a result bled the majority of players in a matter of weeks. and then killed only after half a year before it could be developed any further :(  maybe capcom will learn with RE:verse oof"
68423065,english,0,952070,"TL;DR: The game is has soooo much potential, but is mired by massive balance issues (both for new players and for high level ones), terrible connectivity due to P2P networking, progression scaling that is very punishing to new players, zero intelligent, skill-based matchmaking, and an absurd amount of hackers.  So, first of all let me say I do actually *really* like this game. There's some serious potential in this game, and there's so many mechanics in place that a variety of playstyles can definitely be an option.  Now that that's out of the way, here's why you shouldn't play it, *yet*. The level scaling is ROUGH, for starters. You don't really feel like you're making any impact at all until you get a character to around level 7-10, which is about 4 hours of gameplay. It also matches you with max-ranked players incredibly frequently, regardless of whether or not you're playing mastermind or survivor; because the gear and skills scale so hard up to level 25, you will constantly be getting wrecked. An example is playing an L3 Annette (the first mastermind you can play) with only +8% to creature damage, while a L25 Becca is using a build that gives her literally +230% damage (we've done the math), and can kill your toughest creature in 0.5s.  The inverse is also true, Sam is a pretty broken character right now after level 11, but before that a max rank Daniel mastermind controlling a zombie can *literally* 2-shot you (he has a build that can 1-shot all but 2 characters).  The game is time based, so all gameplay is rush-rush-rush; new players are often left in the dust by their team just trying to figure out where they need to go, and smart masterminds punish that mistake *heavily*, causing you to throw the match by simply not knowing the map.  On top of that, the game is extremely unbalanced in favor of the survivors. Any sub-optimal mastermind build does little more than feed time to half-competent survivors because of poor balance, many builds use multiplicative modifiers to break mechanics (such as Valerie's Remedy Mixtape build that cuts her healing ult down from 150s to 87s, constantly clearing infection that takes over 100s to become effective, Becca's Bullet Storm Ult that will let her kill everything in sight, etc).  That takes me to my final balance gripe. The character Becca has an ult that allows her to have infinite ammo for 10s. This is all fine and balanced until you factor in that this also works on special weapons like the grenade launcher and rocket launcher that are literally balanced on ammo count; once you run out of ammo, the gun is destroyed. Becca can deal 32,000 AoE damage from any range every 87 seconds; the highest health monster has 2650 HP, and the three biocores at the final stage of each map has 16,000 HP. And yes, on 2 of the 4 maps currently in the game you can absolutely shoot two of the 3 biocores from a single location, killing both within 10 seconds.  Oh, and there's hackers. Lots of hackers, literally zero anti-cheat (you can't even kick players in-game for being afk, let alone report them for hacking)."

122490817,english,1,952070,"Update 2024 - Game is dead and full of cheaters. There is still a bit of a Playstation community but on Steam it is more or less completely unplayable. Don't buy...such a shame.  The core concept is great, 1v4 game where the 1 takes the role of the Mastermind - think of it as like a Dungeon Master or Zeus type role - where, through the CCTV cameras dotted around each facility, you lay traps and creatures in front of the survivors in a 3 stage/area experiment to see if they can survive. Each bit of damage you do to the survivors removes time from the clock and on the other side each kill the survivors get or objective completed adds time to the clock. Once they reach stage 3, the survivors have to destroy the bio-cores in order to escape the experiment.  There is a lot of customisation that you can apply to each character on both the mastermind and survivor side so you can almost rebuild a character to perform in a certain way - within their skill set. For the Mastermind, this is in the form of decks of creatures, traps, buffs, camera etc which you place within the level. You then enhance these with equipment so you can make your creatures faster, stronger or buff your economy so you can spawn lots of them for a few examples. You can specialise in certain creatures, you can specialise in cameras and traps, you can specialise in infecting the survivors etc you get the picture. You also have ultimate abilities that can be enhanced and special cards relative to each Mastermind. The same is for the survivors but they only get equipment and can change their special abilities. On top of this, there is tonnes of goofy cosmetics if that is your thing.  As of the date of this review, there is a small die-hard player base that are still playing. Most quite high levels but there are mid to low levels still in the game as well. This does cause issues with matchmaking...I don't believe there is any rank based matchmaking and there is quite a steep learning curve to the game. The tutorial is very very basic and shows you what the buttons are, to actually get good at the game requires map knowledge on both the survivor and mastermind side - which can only be gained by playing and losing quite a bit which I think puts most people off.   There is a bit of a problem with hacking/cheating. I mainly play Mastermind and every now and then you come across survivors who can auto-revive themselves, unlimited ammo, unlimited grenades that sort of thing. You can still beat them but when they quit, on the match summary screen at the end it shows that they won or ""escaped"" - despite the Mastermind actually winning. It doesn't affect your EXP or end match result or anything like that, it is just scummy. I haven't seen it from the Survivor perspective but I would imagine it is exactly the same.  I hope they switch it to a F2P model and give it a bit of TLC to encourage a larger player base back to it but honestly, I doubt that will happen.  Final word; I enjoy it, I think it is quite a unique concept and in the most part it is pretty well executed. The game is relatively balanced; you win some, you lose a lot sort of thing. I would only advise purchasing it on sale though."
76883149,english,0,952070,Incredibly play to win and the matchmaking is beyond bad. Lvl 50-100 survivors with everything unlocked against a lvl 5 mastermind and vice versa. Oh and the other side is always immensly toxic when winning and bullying lvl 5s. Truly i wonder why there are no more new players coming to play this game.
190516605,english,0,952070,"This game was so good. I am sad that it was not promoted at all and then quickly abandoned by Capcom. It is really a shame. If they had given some care to this game, I would have hundreds of hours on it.  The game was plagued by cheaters and lack of dedicated servers (leading to lag) and I still put in this many hours. I can't give it a recommendation because of what Capcom allowed to happen to it. RIP REsistance."
117540257,english,0,952070,"This game has much better potential than RE:Verse, but my god dude what is it with Capcom and making one off gamemodes for Resident Evil? Like now I can understand they want to make maybe online gamemodes but they are making shit nobody wanted, and then not supporting it when it backfires.  But this has actual potential that could possibly compete with shit like Dead By Daylight, IF given the proper management and care. But of course, Capcom did not do anything. It's mediocre at best, filled with hackers, no dedicated servers, not a shred of support to keep this game in a good manageable state.   For the love of God Capcom, if you wanted to make this, fucking make it and at least try to make it work and be enjoyable so it isn't such a forgotten mess. But yeah, this is will be dead forever."
123688204,english,0,952070,"This game is included for free when buying re3. (can't be removed from library) I've been ignoring it till now, since nothing I've heard about this game made me want to give it a try...  However since I'm going through games that I haven't played/played for very short time, I didn't want to make exceptions.  There's very few game modes ""quick match"" you get paired with randoms. Possibly due to the tiny player base there's massive imbalance. As a lvl 1 newbie you will constantly see lvl40, lvl100 or even lvl800 players.  Custom game. You can create either a public or private room.   Practice mode. You can either play as mastermind against 5 bot survivors, or as a survivor against 1 bot mastermind. (You don't level by playing on this mode, nor can you get achievements)  There's no campaign.   The premise itself isn't bad. As a mastermind you spawn/control zombies, place mines, you can even spawn and play as a tyrant!  As survivors you have to complete 3 maps, each map has 3 objectives (ex. find key items, destroy biocores) within a time limit and escape.  However there's no hiding the fact that It's executed rather badly... It's definately the worst resident evil game."

I've quite enjoyed the time I've put into this so far, and only wish that I had more time under my belt.

I guess you should've put the resources and time that went into this shit that nobody asked for and no one wanted into making the main game longer and better, Capcom.

Fuck this crap."
131551582,english,0,952070,"This game has been a mess since release, tightening up some things here and there with patches but ultimately a hard fail in terms of a multiplayer experience. At the time of this review, I am typing this while waiting on matchmaking (going on 5 minutes now) and throughout this critique I will share my thoughts on why this game should be avoided.  In all fairness, I will start with the positives. When matches work its a fun albeit kinda unbalanced game of survivors vs mastermind. Mastermind simply has to keep people in the experiment until the timer runs out, and survivors have to run objectives to get out alive. Respawning survivors deduct more time from the timer giving incentive to the mastermind to really lay into the survivor group and kill them as much as possible. Gameplay between the two sides is quite different, as the mastermind gets to really monitor the map as a whole with cameras and use abilities via a deck of equipment that is modifiable along with other gear that can influence certain attributes. Survivors get their own loadouts too and skills to bring their own touch to the group effort.   The really big problems? Loot boxes, progression systems, and rankings that are all out of balance make most match ups pretty one sided. Especially this late in the game's release with limited player base, expect matchmaking to be almost non-existent; putting you head to head with people who will have way more unlocked options and experience than you as they steamroll your efforts. The limited player base also makes it a shockingly long wait to get enough for a game. Capcom....why the fuck don't you ever explore the use of bots for your multiplayer games? Sure AI won't quite match a living, breathing player in most cases but in a game like this that hinges on having exactly 5 people then being able to fill empty spots is absolutely necessary when it reaches this point.  Full disclosure here, I did have to stop writing this as I finally got a match, which took me roughly another five minutes making it about a 10 minute wait for a match that lasted maybe a fraction of that. Not the worst game this series has to offer, and can't feel too wronged as I got it for free from getting RE3 (which was mostly good). Pass on this game, its another failed experiment from half-assed ideas given half-assed effort."
77902681,english,0,952070,"Fun idea, but messy execution.  -Game has been in a constant state of unbalance. First survivors were OP, then Masterminds with the Nicholai DLC, then back to Survivors again, where it stuck all the way thru.  -Game has a brutal learning curve: if you're just starting be prepared to lose, over and over again until you hit somewhere around level 20 on any of the survivors or masterminds  -No Anti-Cheat: I've played games where survivors would pull infinite molotovs, gun ammo, first aid sprays, and rocket launchers for longer than is possible in the game. I've seen survivors grab the area 1 keys through walls without leaving the safe zones.  -Community is, when looking at it optimistically, a mixed bag. There's some really awesome players but there's also a LOT of toxicity. More on that below.   -Active userbase is small .The Game's Last Update was the beginning of October, with no foreseeable updates in sight to fix the lack of proper balance. Most of the players have moved on and the few that remain are hardcore players with levels going as far as the 100-300 range. Because the pool is so small, you tend to wait in queue for a while, and you tend to get the same few people over and over again (which isn't fun if the connection is bad as a survivor, or if you're running against overpowered LVL 100+ SWAT teams as a mastermind)  -No dedicated servers, game is pvp with mastermind as host. Games can be ruined via bad connections and you're guaranteed to see a ""losing connection with mastermind"" type warning in every game you play. You a mastermind with bad internet? Prepare to be repeatedly harassed in dms and your profile about how you're a cheater and a lag switcher.  TL;DR - Game is unbalanced, has a small, quite hostile at times community, no servers, no anti-cheat, and no update to fix it all in sight. You'll have more fun playing RE 2 Remake or the RE 3 Remake Proper."

90452445,english,1,952070,"Well, I am reviewing as a newbie in multiplayer games and only as a survivor player in Resistance! I have never tried any multiplayer game, but since it was included with the RE3, I decided to give it a try. I started with the tutorial and then practice, in which I never managed to win in just five minutes. Tried with more time and I just saw how it goes. Didn't seem so exciting or even interesting. But since my first attempt playing in multiplayer mode, I got thrilled! It made a huge difference. Playing for now at least, only as a survivor, depending on how evil and experienced the Mastermind is, the game can be very challenging. Some really good Masterminds, make it even more evil and revengeful! It really gets into you, trying to escape, collaborate with the best way and help your fellow players. For me to say that a game is good and awesome, it must absorb, transfer my existence in to it and make me focus only on the mission/object. And Resistance definitely did that.   The fact that the online matches are relatably short, is an advantage, as you can experience gameplay in different areas, Mastermind difficulty and strategies, and fellow survivor characters. This game deserves more players!!! Com'on guys! I'm waiting for you to escape together!"
77405959,english,0,952070,"Had good potential, but it lacks balancing.  The game is unbalanced at low rank on both sides. As a survivor you don't have enough equipment/unlocks to fight high rank masterminds. As a low rank mastermind, you don't have enough equipment/unlocks to fight high rank survivors. Being required to play 40+ hours disadvantaged just to get on a level playing field will drive away all new players.  The game also fatally suffers from each match being hosted by the Mastermind, who benefits greatly from having a bad connection by making everyone else lag. If you get pitted against a russian Mastermind, might as well Alt+f4 cause it won't be playable.  More balancing and polish would be needed for this game to succeed, as it is, it's critically low on player count and steadily dying."

Which leaves us with an altogether BIGGER problem: Why should I spend any money on anything made by Capcom EVER AGAIN? This was by far the most fun multiplayer Resident Evil experience I have EVER had! There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about playing this game! They broke this game for the benefit of a different multiplayer game they made instead: Resident Evil ReVerse. But Resident Evil ReVerse isn't Resident Evil Resistance; Resident Evil ReVerse SUCKS.

I mean, first you should check yourself and notice how stupid you sound: Resident Evil is, in its core, and how everyone has ever perceived to be, a SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCE...  But worry not, Capcom has attempted to make this absolute ""cashgrab"" of a game, and the vision is there whether you like it or not: there is a premise: every survivor has got a set of skills, they work together to prank the killer, who's got a better skillset, and escape the laboratory... Now, Dead by Daylight worked because Behaviour Interactive does its absolute best to keep the game balanced, and without hackers... Capcom? Hah, I know exactly what goes on in Capcom's head department: ""Well, let's add the Resident Evil name to it, and leave it for dead, people WILL play it, because they love Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, even with hackers"". That's funny because the game is an absolute GHOST TOWN right now.  I've been in queue for half an hour, and finally somebody joins and my entire pc slows down by like 170 frames per second... Being knowledgeable about how online games work, I immediatly told myself: ""How the F does Capcom allow Cheat Engine to run in an ONLINE game?"". Also, who came up with the idea of having the ""MasterMinds"", the supposed-to-be ANTAGONISTS in a RESIDENT EVIL game, to look like and be really just normal individuals... How am I supposed to believe that Annette was just working as a nurse all day long in a private clinic, then she got bored and started summoning zombies in the laboratory... Poor delusional Capcom lol they make lies, believe them and try to shove them down people's throats and it never goes well lol  Hopefully, the game can be 100%d even at this state, all you have to do is find a friend to do the achievements with, OR, if you've got 0 friends like me, grab your other second-hand laptop and log into your other Steam account and play with yourself till you get all the achievements haha. This is a [b]1/10[/b] miserable attempt at reaching Behaviour Interactive's level, but you know Capcom? Maybe you should stay in YOUR LANE... Be as woke as you want, but maybe don't try your hands at multiplayer games that are not FIGHTING games...

The concept isn't bad in theory but in pratice it's pretty horrible, the game feels cheap even with those amazing graphics.  The only thing this game does perfectly is showing us that a 4 player Co-op Resident Evil is possible but instead we get a PvP RE that nobody really asked.  Where's ""Resident Evil : Oubreak""  Capcom ? Not even a remake just a port of the two original would go a long way to show that you care about co-op RE."

Capcom: Also known for making crappy RE multiplayer games...  I know a lot of people like me thought it would be cool to have a ""Resident Evil Multiplayer Mode"" but don't just copy and paste different characters from other games onto this. Resident evil 6 was multiplayer co-op and even that was better than this!!!  Look, all I'm trying to say is that Resident Evil RE: Verse as it's priced £34.99 looks very doughy. All I would like to see at least happen is for there to be a seperate, more funtional, story-telling multiplayer co-op like 5 and... 6.

There's so much equipment and skill sets to unlock and experiment for both Survivors and Masterminds which allows for a huge array of costumization, making you wish to keep on trying different builds. The voice acting for the game is also what gives it charm, especially the Masterminds. Both voice actors and voice actresses did a phenomenal job. The soundtrack is also something to admire. Each map has it's own different background music to set up the mood for your surroundings and it even changes according to what's going on at the moment; for example, the music gets more intense whenever a Mastermind controls a zombie. As for the cosmetics, there's [b]a lot[/b] of them, ranging from sprays to weapon skins to even zombie skins (for Masterminds). You're bound to find something that you'll like amongst all of them. The downside is that the game's population isn't exactly big, however, it's still possible to find matches without waiting too long.

I don't understand why Capcom decided to abandon a great idea, I'm sure it would've been of the best and most-played games of this genre if they had advertised it differently (maybe sold as a standalone game, free to play, etc) and decided to have dedicated servers and a proper anti-cheat system. They left this to dead, at some point they started to see this idea as an evil resident in their company, and unfortunately, Resistance cannot resist the fall of player base due to lack of faith from its creator.   Although I deeply wish (and pray) that Capcom reconsiders their decisions and starts working to get this amazing game up and running, for now, unfortunately I have to say that this game is not worth the price, but if I marked it as recommended, it's maybe on the hope that, as I said, Capcom rethinks its decisions."

69338052,english,1,952070,I know maybe others don't agree with me. But I really love this game. It brings me so much fun. I know quite many friends due to this game. Thank you Capcom. Thank you Resident Evil

86477459,english,1,952070,"I played this game for almost 200 hours on ps4. Now I finally have it on PC and I'm sad to see that the reception is bad. I played a little and I didn't find any cheaters so far. This game DOES need cross play (and anti cheat if it's not true) It's sad that you have to buy Resident Evil 3 to be able to play it even. It's everything you love that makes RE2 and 3 challenging. Except in the form of a coop game. The fact that the master mind is player controlled makes it so that every match is quite random. There are soooo many strategies that they can effectively use.  Do you like shooting zombies and using your wits to survive while solving objectives in dynamic modern survival horror combat and level traversal? Then this game is for you!!! There are many types of zombies, many builds you can make, many ways to play to survive and avoid being bit. Many ways to save your team and turn the tides to your favor doing awesome plays. Like for example when you get bit or die you lose time. The remaining match time determines whether you win or lose. If you do an objective or hurt/kill zombies you gain time. You can dodge through a bunch of zombies and use the right weapons to make room to move... Just to get to an objective across and then save the match that way. It's even better when your team has your back while doing it! There are many ways to play and many master mind tricks to look out for. I was just shot gunning one of the bio cores with a yellow herb, shooting dogs that were circling me at the same time while my team was panicking across the room in a crowd of zombies haha  All the resident evil challenges we love in the other survival horror RE games are here and it plays really great with all the deep mechanics!"
85537858,english,0,952070,The game is fun but support for it is basically dead and the only way it could be worth buying is if they didn't bundle it with RE3. I got it on sale for $20 but I would have easily payed $30 for what was a good time.
66909236,english,1,952070,"I think RE: Resistance could be a really good game given a fair opportunity, but you can blame Capcom (not Neobards) for ***** it up with poor distribution, lack of faith in supporting the game with dedicated servers, and not having anti-cheat. The game uses peer-to-peer connections so as the community declined, the matches became very unstable for the survivors. It also created a lot of toxicity in the community because the survivors naturally blame the host for the ""lag-switching"", even though it's just a bad connection that tends to get worse with the higher creature limit. Some people like to blame Neobards for not supporting the game which is not true, I have been playing since day one with 700+ hours, and the developers have pushed many good, and admittedly not so good balancing/content updates. To be fair, there are some balancing issues that make it very difficult for new players to pick up the game, specifically ""gun and mine decks"" that require a specific character with an optimized build.  Personally, I still enjoy the game because it has a very high skill ceiling, even after hundreds of hours I still learn new strategies for the mastermind and survivors to some extent. People don't give Resistance the credit for how complex it is, there are so many different ways to play each mastermind, not to mention that each map creates a different dynamic. The game is not very noob friendly, it takes at least 200 hours to be a worthwhile teammate, and it only takes one bad player to drag the entire team down. After the latest balancing patch, you would be lucky to win 30% of your survivor games in random which is certainly not a positive experience. Many players can't tell the difference between cheats and good players because the combination of certain cards can create some very abusive combination. When the Nicholai was introduced into the game, It felt like about half of the community rage quit because of uninteractive gun decks - they have been nerfed significantly, but you could still argue that gun decks are more effective overall.   Most importantly, Resistance can be a very fun game when you get those close matches with a good connection. I love the characters because they have so much personality, and I love the gameplay depth that it provides. There is just something really fun about being a ""bad guy"" and doing map presents, working out the best way to kill 4 people. For me it was the first asymmetrical multiplayer, I know there are other popular games that provide a better experience, but I guess I just have a misplaced sense of loyalty for this game, probably because it's based in Resident Evil lore. I honestly hope that we see characters like Daniel and January in other resident evil titles, I think they provide more flavor to what is otherwise is a very generic cast of characters if we being completely honest. Additionally, game has a deck-building aspect with many moving parts, adding a lot variety, experimenting and replay value.   [i] The cast of survivors makes the game feel like a cheesy horror movie, there is just something fun about roleplaying as stereotypes in a bad situation which reminds me of ""Friday the 13th"". [/i]  [h1] Pros: [/h1]  + I love the characters, both survivors and masterminds  + very high skill ceiling, good gameplay depth + ability to customize map presets and decks + many enjoyable character skins, even for zombies + fun roreplaying aspect  [h1] Cons: [/h1]  [u] Abusive Decks [/u] - there are certain decks that take advantage of characters that can't directly interact with you. Usually, those decks involve something to do with cameras or trap activation, like shield resets or just camera durability. You will find that sometimes your team just does not have the right tools for a fair fight, and even if you do, it could take a lot of perfect decisions. More recently, they introduced a toxic ""immunity"" mechanics which makes it unclear when to fight enemies.   [u] Distribution [/u] - It should be a free game with any RE purchase, it can't just be a RE3 tumor because it's a completely different game with a different audience. The smaller the community, the more likely you are to get a laggy match. It's peer to peer so it's not like they need money for hosting servers.   [u] Connection [/u] - due to the community decline, you will get matches with people in different regions, making the game borderline unplayable, or impossible on stage 3.  [b] Overall Thoughts: [/b]  As much as some people want to crap on Resistance I think those opinions are based on incomplete information or simply blaming the game for things that devs had little control over. To be fair the game is dead and there are many reasons for it, both in the game and outside of the game. Given a different mindset with distribution and content support, I think it could be a different story. I enjoyed it while it lasted, and I will play it from time to time with what remains of the community... Now I just hope that we can see some of the survivors in the new RE games - can you imagine Barry actually meeting Martin Sandwich...

105686635,english,1,952070,"Getting the RE 2 mod for this makes it 10x better! It's really fun to play with friends especially. I will say that this game does have an unbalanced system, for example, you can be a level 25 and go against a mastermind level 200. No one is ever too OP though. Often, you are playing against the same people and you learn to counter them as you keep going against them. It is a very fast paced game and it is fun to try and win at the last second!"
166500703,english,0,952070,"It could be fun but it has all but been abandoned by the developers and there are so many sweats and hackers playing the killers that it does kill a lot of the fun that could be gleaned from what remains of the game. Very few people play the game anymore, but I will admit, I did have fun playing it when it would work and you could find quality matches ( which was unfortunately rare ). I don't recommend because it really isn't being maintained anymore and it also has a lot of really big problems."

Then frequent disconnects occur, especially if a host has bad internet (yes, RESISTANCE is not server based). Glitches, desyncs, noclips... you name it!

116882201,english,1,952070,"This game is pretty fun as a concept, but as it's executed it just feels too one sided. Everything is stacked against the Mastermind if the Survivors have any understanding of what they're doing."
113094909,english,1,952070,"This game was done dirty. Its actually really good, but tacking it onto RE3 instead of making it a standalone caused a lot of review bombing, and the devs basically gave up on supporting it. Its a shame really."
112255811,english,0,952070,"Look, I'm glad Capcom tried something new with Resistance, and to be honest, I do get a little enjoyment out of playing, but I cannot deny that the game is in an awful state, and there are a LOT of glaring issues with it.  Let's not beat around the bush and just get into it.  The matchmaking system is atrocious. It's so horrifically unbalanced to the point that if I had to chug an entire bottle of beer for every high-leveled player, both on the Survivor and Mastermind sides, I would've died of alcohol poisoning after what, 3 matches? It also takes forever to find a match sometimes, the queue times are so incredibly inconsistent. I nearly hit 20 minutes one time trying to find a 5th player. I wish I was kidding.  Playing as the Survivor usually goes a few different ways.  -Get carried through the entire match because the level 257 player can weave through the entire map unscathed, grab every single key item in a single blink, and have everybody make it out before you even get a chance to realize what just happened. -Get left behind CONSTANTLY because of basically ZERO communication between Survivors. Yeah, there are ""emotes"", but those can only do so much. There's no text/voice chat whatsoever, so you just have to pray that you can keep up with everybody else, because they sure as hell aren't gonna wait for you. -Usually end up running out of time because trying to rush as fast as possible to the exit while also watching out for traps doesn't exactly mix well. -Most likely get stuck in the first area because spamming everything you have as the Mastermind works surprisingly well, and fail because apparently, you’re supposed to push through Lickers that will down you in two hits, or worse, cameras that can shoot at you and can also down you incredibly quickly. Seriously, the Nikolai update RUINED this game. -Have at least one person disconnect at some point during the match, crippling your team and usually means you’re not making it to the end. -Or, and this is a favorite, have EVERYBODY ELSE disconnect, leaving you alone with the Mastermind as they spam everything they have behind the very first door.  Now playing as the Mastermind you would think would be the saving grace, right? What do you think?  -Watch as the matchmaking system makes your life hell as it pairs you up against an entire team of gold-wearing Survivors, all with triple-digit levels and able to take down everything you throw at them with ease. -Feel bad as you totally destroy a clearly new player being shoved in with people who have 3,000+ hours because as I mentioned, the matchmaking is atrocious. -Have the Survivors breeze through all of your traps and enemies because the Mastermind controls are so unintuitive and sluggish that by the time you have a room set up with clever traps and well-placed enemies, the Survivors have already left the Area. -Trying the spam “technique” that apparently works so well when you’re playing as a Survivor, but have it backfire on you so miserably that you might as well just leave the match and uninstall.  The lag is HORRENDOUS. It will literally take entire SECONDS after you’ve shot an enemy for the damage to pop up. Try to empty an entire magazine or absolutely beat the crap out of an enemy with a melee weapon? There's a very high chance that the game will just give you a middle finger and say you missed EVERYTHING. There's a few times where you'll walk down a hallway perfectly fine, and then all of a sudden get downed because apparently, you were getting shot at by a camera that entire time, because again, SCREW the Nikolai update. And on top of it all, you also have a high chance to miss every other turn because even though you clearly hit left, you’ll keep running forwards for a couple more seconds, and THEN finally have your input register as you turn right into an enemy that downs you, and get left alone as apparently all the other Survivors are already at the Exit while you just barely made it to where the first key was supposed to be. I think the biggest reason why the lag is so awful is because Capcom made the baffling decision to use P2P connections. Are dedicated servers really just so unfathomable to developers?  Lootcrates, anyone? Because in order to get ANY upgrades or cosmetics for your characters, you have to go through them. And of course, playing matches will only get you a certain amount of points to buy said crates, even LESS if you fail. The only way to max out how many? You basically have to do a flawless run. EVERY TIME. Yeah, you can use RP Boosters to increase the amount of points you get, but they only last for so long. But hey, you can always buy more. WITH REAL MONEY.  There are an embarrassing amount of glitches too, like trying to pick a Survivor just... not working as you're stuck on the menu until someone inevitably leaves. Or have your mouse randomly stop working, forcing you to plug in a controller just to continue playing. And my favorite, going to pick up an item on the last Area of a match, only for the game to freak the f**k out and literally teleport you outside the map, making you unable to move and be forced to watch as every other Survivor leaves without you.  What sucks the most is that I can totally see the potential of this game, I do enjoy the game when it works and doesn't lag out to all hell, the characters are unique and interesting, the gameplay, while flawed, could totally work, and the general idea is rock-solid and with some more love and dedication, I think this could be a fantastic game if Capcom actually put forward the effort to fix it and make it better... but sadly, something tells me that Capcom won't do that anytime soon. Or ever.  And again, SCREW the Nikolai update."
77051175,english,0,952070,"I like the escape room concept but there are so many flaws in this game.  FLAWS Timer is way too short. Never enough time. It's like you're expected to know exactly where all the key items are and if you have all the supplies needed like lots of ammo and melee.  I understand that all Resident Evil games, EXCEPT 4 and later, have very small pouches (girls have purses boys have fanny packs) so they can only carry 8 items. Definitely not enough space. 16 or more spaces would be perfect.  Random people are mostly players who want to have fun while this game is so difficult that requires pure skill.  Best to play when you have a team, clan, or guild or close friends who play this with you so you can practice, discuss, or even use voice chat.  It is true what they say about the mastermind or I like to call it (security guard, lol. Get it? Their main work purpose is monitoring and alerting) They are too overpowered and 8 out of 10, they win.  It took me awhile to find key items, there should be a arrow above the characters head that points a direction where you need to go like a compass instead of checking the map, when you browse the map, the mastermind takes this wonderful opportunity to kill you because you are ""afk"".  DESTROYING THE WATER TANKS TAKE FOREVER, A LOT OF TIME CONSUMED. Expect 3 to 10 minutes. And you need to break 4 of them total.  If all the things I posted were updated in favor of the survivors and I mean a huge buff to survivors and a huge NERF to mastermind then you would get more positive reviews.  CONCLUSION This game is only playable singleplayer on free mode, plenty of time, money, and supplies. You gotta be lucky or very popular to play this with people you know and people you practice with.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! WASTE OF CPU MEMORY!"
90692945,english,1,952070,"RE:Resistance is an arcade style randomly generated 1v4 horror game. Firstly, this game is done. There is no more development being worked on, whatever we have is what we have - and we have a lot for what we've gotten. The game can be a bit difficult to get into because you have to get equipment to add to your characters / mastermind or survivor / as MM this means you might be getting your shit kicked in for a bit till you can afford some high level equipment, and as survivor - you can get by without full equipment; but if the MM Is tricked out you might feel overwhelmed by the zombies. This can often give players the perception that the MM Is ""hacking"" when infact its just that they have alot of equipment / levels over you. But, because the game has such a low population - it's difficult for it to match players that are at close levels, so this might happen occasionally, but with the recent sale i've been getting more players in the lower levels of things. I play this game entirely solo as i dont have any friends who are masochistic enough to play this with me all night, but despite this - I still manage to have lots of  fun when im not lagging out because of the MM's connection, or we're being hacked to death. and most if not all the time it's the former. But in the small moments where everything is working as intended :tm: the game absolutely shines. The characters are fully voiced beautifully, the director of the VAs was ON it. They interact with each other and the environment, their voicelines are so clear and crisp and are VERY reactive. it's very immersive. The atmosphere is incredible, and you'll often find yourself stopping to soak in the air while your team is getting mauled to death by and E.I.S zombie. The MM's are very wellwritten - each having unique traits and playstyles that shows in every aspect of the personality. Ontop of that, we also get to design custom loadouts for every character, MM or survivor. This includes changing how your passive / active / ultimate works, and of course those equipments that can increase your durability/damage/health and even decrease negative effects. We also have VERY unique cosmetics for every character/weapon we even have dances you can unlock that you can perform as a zombie when playing MM or as a survivor - and the meme level of those is high af  To be honest, capcom shit the bed with this one - the game had alot of potential, but now it lives in a small cave, being worshipped by a cult following. If you're buying RE3 JUST to play this, please wait for a sale - you will feel so much better about the price tag when you are dealing with laggy connections, and when youre getting shat on by mechanics while learning.  Like, there IS a learning curve - and it is kind of hightened because you wont be playing with complete shitter masterminds always, or complete shitter survivors. But understand that once you get the equipment you need the load starts to become alot more manageable and you'll find yourself having more fun than you were before  PS:  only buy high tier equipment  PPS: also barging into doors is a negative frame please just let your tyrone kick it in or let jill lockpick it - if you have to barge in have someone train a gun on the door behind you"

74572924,english,1,952070,"I had been having so much fun with this game, and I started to get tired of it by the fourth or fifth month, playing every single night. It still is extremely thrilling to play with friends and very challenging to play randomly. It's great to play as all the characters, who have fully-realised concepts, by the way. I love their voice lines and backstories. The game had monthly updates, but it was over by November. The mechanics and graphics are better than ever for the franchise, although there are stressful moments like zombies chain-grabbing you in a small area or several dogs and lickers jumping at you non-stop... But as a fan, I do enjoy it.  Playing as Mastermind is quite amusing as well... There's something evil about cornering survivors with waves of buffed creatures, locking doors behind them and laying traps on the stairs and watching them fall for them. There's something thrilling about playing Spencer and saying ""I'm doing this for humanity... Humanity needs me as a God. Don't you agree?""  However, there are serious issues with this game, the biggest being the absence of dedicated servers and anti-cheat system, as well as how unbalanced it feels in the beginning. By playing it, I did get frustrated a lot coming across Masterminds (which are the villains, and ironically, the hosts of the matches) who either cheat or have terrible network connections, making the match lag so hard that I have seen zombie dogs fly. In the beginning, you might want to quit this game for good because it is so unfair for players without any experience since you will have a hard time trying to go up against death squads (if you play as the MM) or well-prepared villains (if you play as the survivors), all levelled up at high ranks and full of stuff at their disposal while you have nothing (nearly nothing).  Apart from that, the game is really cool, and I love the costumes available in-game for free as well. Such a shame many people don't recognise the potential of this entry and it pains me to see such an amazing game die so quickly."
67794752,english,1,952070,"In short, the game is good and have a lot of potential, but if the problems remains unresolved then the game will be dead quickly.

[b] 2: [/b] Having a P2P connection instead of dedicated servers increase lag with the host (Mastermind).

Issues with balancing are blatant, with some characters and masterminds being a lot more useful than others, often creating unevenness in matches. The game itself is very repetitive, as the objectives don't vary all that much. Matchmaking is generally atrocious. The player base never really caught on so finding a match can take ages and often when you do, there are loads of cheaters that suck whatever enjoyment remains.

Many MMs are laggy. I don't know whether it is because the area is too far away, the server is faulty, or the MM got internet problem. XD Anyway I like this game very much as a biohazard fan but I don't recommend to play it. : (  2023.04.17 added: This game is literally broken by bots, you cannot find matches as MM in random. If you are a veteran and planning for a return, I suggest you to go for custom. There are some static people playing custom games every day but it's kinda hard to level up due to the point you earn from custom is really low. Rookie? I suggest you go find something else to play.  如果是国人的话，野排已经死了。建议加我好友拉你进开黑群，人够了一般会发车玩自定义，也能体验这个游戏，不过自定义给的经验很少，很难升级，对新人很不友好。"

Imagine, all of the cut content that didn't make it into the final game instead of this sorry excuse for a Dead by Daylight/OUTLAST Trials clone.

74422770,english,1,952070,"To all the new people or the people who have barely touched this, give it a chance. Yeah it has its flaws and some Masterminds can be complete toxic, but it's normal to not win, it's meant to feel like a victory when you win. Just like Dead By Daylight, you're not going to win every game!   Sometimes there's lag too which can be a problem, but this game is still in its early stages and they have fixed a lot since it's release!   I've put in over 1,000 hours into this game and I still love it! I find the reviews this game has right now unfair personally. Find yourself a team too, you'll have a better time! Learn the game, don't give up. If you love Dead By Daylight or any other asymmetrical games, you will love this too, just practice and learn it, it does become fun once you find your playstyle! The skills and equipment are a game changer! Having nothing really does make things harder!"

76801053,english,0,952070,"Friends let me start like this, disappointing The multiplayer part of the third version is not interesting at all and has a lot of in-app payments, which forces you to buy and upgrade faster and access equipment to fight and advance. This title was supposed to be sold separately, but It was sold together with the third version. Unfortunately, it is not of good quality and has nothing to do with your experience. The game servers are empty and you have to wait a long time to go to the competition and experience it. And very soon this title will disappoint you. May be.  دوستان بذارید اینطور شروع کنم،ناامید کننده بخش چند نفره بازسازی نسخه سوم،اصلا جالب نیست و پرداخت های درون برنامه ای بسیاری دارد،که شما رو مجبور به خرید و ارتقا سریع تر و دسترسی به تجهیزات برای مبارزه و پیشروی میکند.این عنوان قرار بود به صورت جداگانه به فروش برسد ولی با نسخه سوم یکجا فروخته شد متاسفانه کیفیت خوبی ندارد و چیزی ندارد که شما رو به تجربه آن مشغول کند.سرور های بازی خالی هستند و مجبورید انتظار های طولانی بکشید برای رفتن به رقابت و تجربه آن.و خیلی زود این عنوان برای شما ناامید کننده میشود."

119557540,english,1,952070,"Do not listen to the negative reviews, give this game a try and make up your own opinion. Play both survivors and Mastermind, the latter is especially unique and there is no other game that has this game mechanic. I ignored reviews and tried this game out, it has hooked me, I play it alot its a fun game once you get the hang of it. The hardest part is the beginning because many people are experienced and skill difference is high between new players and veterans, but once you get to know the basics its really fun. The only downside is the absence of dedicated servers, p2p connection makes games for survivors often laggy, because of the small playerbase its likely that Mastermind(who is host) is far away in the world. The playerbase is small but is very active, so you always find matches between 1-5 minutes usually, if you select Random in Quick Match. The only blame should not be given to this game but Capcom who did not give this game the treatment it deserved, this game has a lot of wasted potential."
191466572,english,1,952070,"5/10 - I don't know even who is the audience for this game, but unexpectadly I enjoyed it!  Received this game as a bonus for Resident Evil 3 remake pre-order, never cared about it and never planned to play it, but since then I start grinding for achivs. Heard that the games servers will be shut down in summer, so I assumed it's time to play it now or never.  Visually it's what you saw in RE2RE and RE3RE - a good looking game. Yet level design is a luckluster, I don't know how difficult it is to make balanced and yet captivated locations so I might be wrong in this, but they definitely could make it better and more memorable. Not even a single stage impressed me, yet almost all of them have some parts of the stage that I really like.  Music and sounds, overall pretty good, more or less memorable music, well delivered lines by masterminds and survivors, good-decent sounds on everything else.  Gameplay - four survivors vs mastermind, while survivors try to make an objective and escape from stage, mastermind tries to stop them with everything they got. Doesn't sound all to great on paper, but actually might be a lot of fun. Why ""might"" be you ask? First of all P2P connection, you might be from UK while you opponent will be from japan, but sometimes it will feel like he is from Saturn. Because its P2P you will find yourself playing against some ""pluggers"", you got fine/tolerable connection in stage 1 and terrible at stage 3, up to forced disconnect. And of course we got cheaters, there is not that much of them (because there is not that much players) but they are here. There is some veterans in the game, not to mention they know the game in and out unlike you, they also got all abilities and perks/equipment unlocked which puts you into serious disadvantage. The last one is balance, I didn't play this game as long as others, but it feels survivors are in favour, 4 survivor veterans will pulvaryze veteran mastermind, IF one of them will be unlucky, ""how is that?"" the thing is when you choose your survivor/mastermind you don't know who you will play against and won't make a hard counterpick.Although I said I enjoyed it, It wasn't very intresting to play as survivor, yet playing as mastermind was quite enjoyable for me.  I hope RESISTANCE 2 will come out someday (it probably won't), because I do see a potential in the game, but you need to put more effort and faith in this project Capcom ."
85457326,english,0,952070,"If you are a newby DON'T play in this game. Matchmaking is an absolute joke. For example you start as Mastermind Rank 1 and the game puts survivors Rank 100 against you. Or as Survivor Rank 1 you get to fight Mastermind Rank 100. And there are literally only 100 people playing this game daily. I suppose the game had bigger online in spring 2020, but now it's dead. The sad thing is that I think the RE:SISTANCE is pretty fun. The gameplay is interesting and it's fun to play this kind of game  in the RE Universe. But I really can’t feel good about it right now. So take my advice, if you just bought Resident Evil 3, don't bother yourself even downloading RE:SISTANCE. Save your time and disc space on your PC."
139326727,english,0,952070,"[h1] Review[/h1]  Since RE3 was such a short game for a semi-full price game adding some sort of Multiplayer is definitely not a bad idea if the multiplayer is actually fun an interesting. RE5 and 6 had a much longer game and shipped or later on added various multiplayer coop or vs modes. This one goes the hardest route I can imagine: asymmetrical gameplay in a pvp environment.  [u]Gameplay[/u] Here is the kicker. I cannot really describe the gameplay because you cannot play the game anymore. Not only is the player base low but also, aside private matches, public matchmaking is not possible. Its necessary for unlocking cosmetics or abilities and permanent modifications.   Matchmaking is not possible as the player who is the Mastermind will most of the time get a glitched lobby. I´ve been told that the reason for that is the hacks of someone. Bots will directly try to join a Masterminds lobby and immediately leave and rejoin or some weird stuff like that. So, in 2 hours of searching, I managed to find (my) premade group as the mastermind twice.  The core gameplay is as far as I can see not actually that bad. You have four survivor with various abilities and playstyles and a mastermind who tries to kill or damage the player and thus lowering the time they have to escape. The game has three stages, first a key/puzzle piece hunt, then a keycard hunt where the person who has the keycard has to interact with various terminals and at last you have to destroy three power cores to escape. A game usually takes around 10-20 minutes.  The mastermind places traps and monsters depending on a complex card and resource system. He also has to use cameras whom can be shot. I cannot say really how balanced it is but I doubt it is balanced in any way aside playing it very casually. If people remember the camera positions or pick characters that are op (I heard certain survivors make certain masterminds obsolete, characters like Jill or Becca are very often picked. Mastermind Nikolai also seems hated as he solely works by spamming traps and trying to shoot down a survivor with a camera gun when he cannot move.  [u]Story[/u] None, just random villains and aside Jill who got added later on there are survivors created just for this game.   [u]Sound[/u] From an absolute banger of a main menu theme towards more environmental songs that step up in certain situations this game got it all. Really great ost that doesn’t have to hide from the rest of the franchise. Even got voice acting in a couple of languages too!  [u]Graphics[/u] While it does take the same style and graphics of RE2/3 there is a downgrade. It does have a few interesting animations, especially in melee combat with various zombie finisher, it does have a worse quality. Probably got downgraded due to the online portion.  [u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u] All in all playing a few rounds with friends was really fun. There are a lot of problems with this mode, being unplayable at the moment wasn’t its final nail in the coffin. Bad balancing for a game system like that it had a lack of support from the developer and I also heard, aside the currently hacked lobbies, that people back then managed to solely hack the game with cheat engine. Yeah no wonder it died directly.  Broken and dead multiplayer game"
67754177,english,0,952070,"As a matter of fact, I had to force myself to meditate and calm down before exploding in anger in the course of writing this review. why did I bother to write this review? maybe I wanted to complain about what made me feel uncomfortable; thus I could feel better.  The game is set in the in vivo experiment base with human beings by Umbrellas. The game rules are simple: the experimenter tries to stop survivors from escaping, and the survivors try to escape with using their resources.  The characters have their own skills and have to crate well-organized strategies so that they will escape from the grasp of the villain experimenter. The game plays under this big framework.  At a glance, it may feel like a survival game, like Dead by Daylight, but it deserves praise for its differentiating elements, including high quality graphic and character design.  There is nothing more to be desired in the game as long as the overall package is concerned. ""survivors work together to create a strategy and fight against experimenter with their own strategies."" A wonderful development of story is anticipated like a beautiful painting. A closer look at its various aspects, however, will reveal that the game is full of problems to which any game enthusiasts would shake their heads.  If only those who love Resident Evil play this game, the small-sized users will not matter. When cheating is prevalent among users, however, things are different. The number of users are already small for this game, but players who cheat extort common users and smile an evil smile behind of a screen. just thinking of this possibility can make disappoint who have been excited to play the game.  If you come across players whose IDs Start with ***, seven in ten cases will turn out to be cheaters. If they are experimenters, you will face endless bombardment by machine guns with numerous zombies around.  The next problem I would lie to point out concerns the network. when the host network is unstable, the players on the surviving side will experience such inconvenience that their game environment becomes uncomfortable. This game only has a small of users. If its host network is unstable you will experience more than simple game play; you will find yourself sitting helpless while vacantly looking at the bloody red monitor after getting beaten by the host experimenter while not being able to do anything.  When you come across cheaters, who usually play on the experimenter side and have IDs starting with ***, there is a big possibility that they are Chinese. Even if there is no cheating, users on the experimenter side are asked o practice a high level of control. Since cheaters can pour out the abilities of an experimenter with no limits, they must prefer the experimenter role for convenience.  I came across a Chinese player that overused cheats and was subjected to no restrictions. I can imagine them deceiving and mocking other honest users and smiling wickedly behind their anonymous ID starting with *** while continuing to cheat right at that moment. You will get a bonus, too, which is their mockery of the manager's inability and celebration of great China.  I feel bad thinking of some players around the world getting tormented by cheaters on resident Evil. My biggest concern is that there is nothing to console the users that were tormented by cheaters and left the game as no media or means of communications has criticized these cheating players.  Can we expect a game culture of respecting and treating those who do play fair with no tricks and deception in this game? If you come across an experimenter and feel suspicious you'd better log out of game and pray that you will not get a match with this Chinese player next time."
156994774,english,0,952070,"This game has potential, but like what other reviews have said, without dedicated server, Mastermind is always the host, thus they can lag switch so survivors can't do anything but to lose.   If you are new, winning as Mastermind is impossible without equipment, and you get matched with high level survivors with equipment who have been playing for years.  There are only handful of active players, after playing for a few hours, you can remember their names and know who is the lag switchers, and who is the toxic teammate blocking objective with items or not getting into gate for next area. Some are online every day because they lag switch to make sure they win when they start losing, there is no point playing against them.  And also, low player count means half your time is playing queue simulator.  In summary, it might be fun for the first few games, but don't even download this, it will waste your time."

82639255,english,1,952070,"Resident Evil Resistance is to say the least, a beautiful monstrosity. In nearly every way possible, this game was strangled, chained for death, and left abandoned, yet there are still many who hold on because there is still so much potential in this game. Despite the plentiful issues, player base toxicity, lag, hacking, questionable design choices, OP Survivor/ Mastermind builds, over-reliance of RNG in mechanics, and lack of teamwork (On and on), there is still so much enjoyment to be had in this game; But alas, that one good game every so often that makes all the absolutely terrible rounds in between worthwhile, is becoming rarer and rarer.  Everyone has known since day one that it should have been sold separately. That one caveat to getting this game immensely hindered its growth. Even without Dedicated Servers, at least there would have been a steady starting player base and coupled with a lesser price for entry, and months of updates, laggy games would have been less frequent, as there would have possibly been more local people to play with which would aid overall enjoyment. As the player base dwindles the games have to reach further and further for players which exacerbates the games lag, as well as it's many flaws. It's truly a vicious cycle. This issue was made even more troublesome when the updates stopped coming and everyone dropped ship, due to heartbreak and the ever worsening state of the game.  Also, I gotta say, this game's store page is absolutely abysmal, the lone 5 pre-released pictures and the all red Recent/All Review Ratings expedited, and was a product of, its ever-increasing irrelevance and popular decline which is sad to see. From the get-go this game is niche, survival horror and especially an Outbreak/Mercenaries style game was a risk, but despite all that, they somehow made a compelling and fun experience. The game's identity problem, lack of direction and faith in the work really shows with how its left in its currently state. If a stranger somehow stumbled on this games store page without any prior knowledge, I highly doubt they would think under all that mediocrity that there is actually a great game laying neglected underneath.  Resistance has made me feel many strong emotions. May they be of pure anger and frustration from constant terrible solo-que matches, bliss and euphoria from a difficult but ever rewarding close game, or simply joy from the little things that make each game played unique and fun. Resistance is amazing, it's my ugly duckling and I love it to pieces. But those that feel similarly know of the deep sadness and just disappointment seeing the game withering away every week to only disappear into obscurity.  Despite the many flaws justly criticized by the player base, I do truly recommend this game because I know there are others out there like me, while knowing and experiencing its shortcomings, that will still find joy and a fulfilling challenge. It's just very unfortunate that this game is left as it is, it could have been so very fruitful if it was given a chance. No wonder why the player base is so morose, divided and spent."

67205347,english,1,952070,"[h1][b]Introduction[/b][/h1] «Resident Evil: Resistance» is an asymmetrical-multiplayer set in the world of Resident Evil. It has developed by «Capcom» in association with «NeoBards Entertainment».  The game has been announcement on «Tokyo Game Show» 2019 and meet negative feedback. As expected, some people was dissatisfied the fact that «Capcom» create project like this instead of «Resident Evil: Outbreak: File 3» or just remake of «Resident Evil: Outbreak». As answer on this situation «Capcom» with announce of «Resident Evil 3» declared that «Resident Evil: Resistance» will be a part of the game.  Also, «Resident Evil: Resistance» has an open-beta in a period from 23rd of March until 3rd of April. [h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1] As dictated by this genre, concept of this game is a resistance of one person with survivors (1 vs. 4). This game divided on two different modes: survivor and mastermind, which one is differ each other a lot.  There are two different objectives of these modes. The survivors have to escape before time runs out, while mastermind ought to prevent them from escaping.  There are six different survivors which have unique skills that they have to use to cover each other and defeat creatures together.  Also, there are four different masterminds, which one of them have unique creatures and special weapon helps them to prevent survivors escape. [h1][b]Visuals[/b][/h1]  This game uses «RE Engine». Regardless of low system requirements, graphics looks great, there are a lot of different options and cinematic effects. As for a cursory glance the game looks more clearly than RE3. Also, optimization of the game is good just like other games on that engine.  The design of the maps looks awesome. Incredible attention to the details. [h1][b]Sound[/b][/h1] Suddenly, the composer of the game is Jeff Broadbent. Everything sounds great like it should be. Especially strands out the main theme.  Also there are a few mixes of tracks from the previous games, and they sounds great in environment of the game. [h1][b]The verdict[/b][/h1]  «Resident Evil: Resistance» is a great example of modern today online games, without any objective but extremely fun. It has great potential. It’s has everything it needs to the popular online game. There are a lot of great choices in the balance of the game, but it's not enough. There is room for improvement. It needs long support.  An indicated list of the issues to be resolved, in my humble opinion: 1) Dedicated servers; 2) Matchmaking improvements; 3) Balance improving, refinement; 4) Some sort of anti-cheat; 5) Cross-platform play."
140614279,english,0,952070,not good bad awfully bad i dont even see a point to say why it's bad burn this game with umbrella corps and resident evil survivor cds
120425824,english,0,952070,"saw this on my list and it reminded me i will never forgive capcom for shooting this game dead lol  my favourite horror asym game but i cannot in good consciousness recommend it because of how terribly it was handled. this thing had no chance. it was marketed so poorly that it was judged on the basis of it ""taking time/budget away from re3r"" and hated for that reason despite it having nothing to do with that game, just arbitrarily bundled with it. you cant buy this thing separately and to this day this steam page is still hidden (??????). horribly unbalanced in all manner of ways and incredibly unintuitive for new players. they failed to patch a lot of its problems out in a timely manner and as a result bled the majority of players in a matter of weeks. and then killed only after half a year before it could be developed any further :(  maybe capcom will learn with RE:verse oof"
68423065,english,0,952070,"TL;DR: The game is has soooo much potential, but is mired by massive balance issues (both for new players and for high level ones), terrible connectivity due to P2P networking, progression scaling that is very punishing to new players, zero intelligent, skill-based matchmaking, and an absurd amount of hackers.  So, first of all let me say I do actually *really* like this game. There's some serious potential in this game, and there's so many mechanics in place that a variety of playstyles can definitely be an option.  Now that that's out of the way, here's why you shouldn't play it, *yet*. The level scaling is ROUGH, for starters. You don't really feel like you're making any impact at all until you get a character to around level 7-10, which is about 4 hours of gameplay. It also matches you with max-ranked players incredibly frequently, regardless of whether or not you're playing mastermind or survivor; because the gear and skills scale so hard up to level 25, you will constantly be getting wrecked. An example is playing an L3 Annette (the first mastermind you can play) with only +8% to creature damage, while a L25 Becca is using a build that gives her literally +230% damage (we've done the math), and can kill your toughest creature in 0.5s.  The inverse is also true, Sam is a pretty broken character right now after level 11, but before that a max rank Daniel mastermind controlling a zombie can *literally* 2-shot you (he has a build that can 1-shot all but 2 characters).  The game is time based, so all gameplay is rush-rush-rush; new players are often left in the dust by their team just trying to figure out where they need to go, and smart masterminds punish that mistake *heavily*, causing you to throw the match by simply not knowing the map.  On top of that, the game is extremely unbalanced in favor of the survivors. Any sub-optimal mastermind build does little more than feed time to half-competent survivors because of poor balance, many builds use multiplicative modifiers to break mechanics (such as Valerie's Remedy Mixtape build that cuts her healing ult down from 150s to 87s, constantly clearing infection that takes over 100s to become effective, Becca's Bullet Storm Ult that will let her kill everything in sight, etc).  That takes me to my final balance gripe. The character Becca has an ult that allows her to have infinite ammo for 10s. This is all fine and balanced until you factor in that this also works on special weapons like the grenade launcher and rocket launcher that are literally balanced on ammo count; once you run out of ammo, the gun is destroyed. Becca can deal 32,000 AoE damage from any range every 87 seconds; the highest health monster has 2650 HP, and the three biocores at the final stage of each map has 16,000 HP. And yes, on 2 of the 4 maps currently in the game you can absolutely shoot two of the 3 biocores from a single location, killing both within 10 seconds.  Oh, and there's hackers. Lots of hackers, literally zero anti-cheat (you can't even kick players in-game for being afk, let alone report them for hacking)."

122490817,english,1,952070,"Update 2024 - Game is dead and full of cheaters. There is still a bit of a Playstation community but on Steam it is more or less completely unplayable. Don't buy...such a shame.  The core concept is great, 1v4 game where the 1 takes the role of the Mastermind - think of it as like a Dungeon Master or Zeus type role - where, through the CCTV cameras dotted around each facility, you lay traps and creatures in front of the survivors in a 3 stage/area experiment to see if they can survive. Each bit of damage you do to the survivors removes time from the clock and on the other side each kill the survivors get or objective completed adds time to the clock. Once they reach stage 3, the survivors have to destroy the bio-cores in order to escape the experiment.  There is a lot of customisation that you can apply to each character on both the mastermind and survivor side so you can almost rebuild a character to perform in a certain way - within their skill set. For the Mastermind, this is in the form of decks of creatures, traps, buffs, camera etc which you place within the level. You then enhance these with equipment so you can make your creatures faster, stronger or buff your economy so you can spawn lots of them for a few examples. You can specialise in certain creatures, you can specialise in cameras and traps, you can specialise in infecting the survivors etc you get the picture. You also have ultimate abilities that can be enhanced and special cards relative to each Mastermind. The same is for the survivors but they only get equipment and can change their special abilities. On top of this, there is tonnes of goofy cosmetics if that is your thing.  As of the date of this review, there is a small die-hard player base that are still playing. Most quite high levels but there are mid to low levels still in the game as well. This does cause issues with matchmaking...I don't believe there is any rank based matchmaking and there is quite a steep learning curve to the game. The tutorial is very very basic and shows you what the buttons are, to actually get good at the game requires map knowledge on both the survivor and mastermind side - which can only be gained by playing and losing quite a bit which I think puts most people off.   There is a bit of a problem with hacking/cheating. I mainly play Mastermind and every now and then you come across survivors who can auto-revive themselves, unlimited ammo, unlimited grenades that sort of thing. You can still beat them but when they quit, on the match summary screen at the end it shows that they won or ""escaped"" - despite the Mastermind actually winning. It doesn't affect your EXP or end match result or anything like that, it is just scummy. I haven't seen it from the Survivor perspective but I would imagine it is exactly the same.  I hope they switch it to a F2P model and give it a bit of TLC to encourage a larger player base back to it but honestly, I doubt that will happen.  Final word; I enjoy it, I think it is quite a unique concept and in the most part it is pretty well executed. The game is relatively balanced; you win some, you lose a lot sort of thing. I would only advise purchasing it on sale though."
76883149,english,0,952070,Incredibly play to win and the matchmaking is beyond bad. Lvl 50-100 survivors with everything unlocked against a lvl 5 mastermind and vice versa. Oh and the other side is always immensly toxic when winning and bullying lvl 5s. Truly i wonder why there are no more new players coming to play this game.
190516605,english,0,952070,"This game was so good. I am sad that it was not promoted at all and then quickly abandoned by Capcom. It is really a shame. If they had given some care to this game, I would have hundreds of hours on it.  The game was plagued by cheaters and lack of dedicated servers (leading to lag) and I still put in this many hours. I can't give it a recommendation because of what Capcom allowed to happen to it. RIP REsistance."
117540257,english,0,952070,"This game has much better potential than RE:Verse, but my god dude what is it with Capcom and making one off gamemodes for Resident Evil? Like now I can understand they want to make maybe online gamemodes but they are making shit nobody wanted, and then not supporting it when it backfires.  But this has actual potential that could possibly compete with shit like Dead By Daylight, IF given the proper management and care. But of course, Capcom did not do anything. It's mediocre at best, filled with hackers, no dedicated servers, not a shred of support to keep this game in a good manageable state.   For the love of God Capcom, if you wanted to make this, fucking make it and at least try to make it work and be enjoyable so it isn't such a forgotten mess. But yeah, this is will be dead forever."

(can't be removed from library) I've been ignoring it till now, since nothing I've heard about this game made me want to give it a try...  However since I'm going through games that I haven't played/played for very short time, I didn't want to make exceptions.  There's very few game modes ""quick match"" you get paired with randoms. Possibly due to the tiny player base there's massive imbalance. As a lvl 1 newbie you will constantly see lvl40, lvl100 or even lvl800 players.  Custom game. You can create either a public or private room.   Practice mode. You can either play as mastermind against 5 bot survivors, or as a survivor against 1 bot mastermind. (You don't level by playing on this mode, nor can you get achievements)  There's no campaign.   The premise itself isn't bad. As a mastermind you spawn/control zombies, place mines, you can even spawn and play as a tyrant!  As survivors you have to complete 3 maps, each map has 3 objectives (ex. find key items, destroy biocores) within a time limit and escape.  However there's no hiding the fact that It's executed rather badly... It's definately the worst resident evil game."

Stop thinking that adding a half-assed generic multiplayer mode gives more value to single player games. It's not true. There is nothing wrong about a game being just a single player. Fuck this crap."
131551582,english,0,952070,"This game has been a mess since release, tightening up some things here and there with patches but ultimately a hard fail in terms of a multiplayer experience. At the time of this review, I am typing this while waiting on matchmaking (going on 5 minutes now) and throughout this critique I will share my thoughts on why this game should be avoided.  In all fairness, I will start with the positives. When matches work its a fun albeit kinda unbalanced game of survivors vs mastermind. Mastermind simply has to keep people in the experiment until the timer runs out, and survivors have to run objectives to get out alive. Respawning survivors deduct more time from the timer giving incentive to the mastermind to really lay into the survivor group and kill them as much as possible. Gameplay between the two sides is quite different, as the mastermind gets to really monitor the map as a whole with cameras and use abilities via a deck of equipment that is modifiable along with other gear that can influence certain attributes. Survivors get their own loadouts too and skills to bring their own touch to the group effort.   The really big problems? Loot boxes, progression systems, and rankings that are all out of balance make most match ups pretty one sided. Especially this late in the game's release with limited player base, expect matchmaking to be almost non-existent; putting you head to head with people who will have way more unlocked options and experience than you as they steamroll your efforts. The limited player base also makes it a shockingly long wait to get enough for a game. Capcom....why the fuck don't you ever explore the use of bots for your multiplayer games? Sure AI won't quite match a living, breathing player in most cases but in a game like this that hinges on having exactly 5 people then being able to fill empty spots is absolutely necessary when it reaches this point.  Full disclosure here, I did have to stop writing this as I finally got a match, which took me roughly another five minutes making it about a 10 minute wait for a match that lasted maybe a fraction of that. Not the worst game this series has to offer, and can't feel too wronged as I got it for free from getting RE3 (which was mostly good). Pass on this game, its another failed experiment from half-assed ideas given half-assed effort."
77902681,english,0,952070,"Fun idea, but messy execution.  -Game has been in a constant state of unbalance. First survivors were OP, then Masterminds with the Nicholai DLC, then back to Survivors again, where it stuck all the way thru.  -Game has a brutal learning curve: if you're just starting be prepared to lose, over and over again until you hit somewhere around level 20 on any of the survivors or masterminds  -No Anti-Cheat: I've played games where survivors would pull infinite molotovs, gun ammo, first aid sprays, and rocket launchers for longer than is possible in the game. I've seen survivors grab the area 1 keys through walls without leaving the safe zones.  -Community is, when looking at it optimistically, a mixed bag. There's some really awesome players but there's also a LOT of toxicity. More on that below.   -Active userbase is small .The Game's Last Update was the beginning of October, with no foreseeable updates in sight to fix the lack of proper balance. Most of the players have moved on and the few that remain are hardcore players with levels going as far as the 100-300 range. Because the pool is so small, you tend to wait in queue for a while, and you tend to get the same few people over and over again (which isn't fun if the connection is bad as a survivor, or if you're running against overpowered LVL 100+ SWAT teams as a mastermind)  -No dedicated servers, game is pvp with mastermind as host. Games can be ruined via bad connections and you're guaranteed to see a ""losing connection with mastermind"" type warning in every game you play. You a mastermind with bad internet? Prepare to be repeatedly harassed in dms and your profile about how you're a cheater and a lag switcher.  TL;DR - Game is unbalanced, has a small, quite hostile at times community, no servers, no anti-cheat, and no update to fix it all in sight. You'll have more fun playing RE 2 Remake or the RE 3 Remake Proper."

90452445,english,1,952070,"Well, I am reviewing as a newbie in multiplayer games and only as a survivor player in Resistance! I have never tried any multiplayer game, but since it was included with the RE3, I decided to give it a try. I started with the tutorial and then practice, in which I never managed to win in just five minutes. Tried with more time and I just saw how it goes. Didn't seem so exciting or even interesting. But since my first attempt playing in multiplayer mode, I got thrilled! It made a huge difference. Playing for now at least, only as a survivor, depending on how evil and experienced the Mastermind is, the game can be very challenging. Some really good Masterminds, make it even more evil and revengeful! It really gets into you, trying to escape, collaborate with the best way and help your fellow players. For me to say that a game is good and awesome, it must absorb, transfer my existence in to it and make me focus only on the mission/object. And Resistance definitely did that.   The fact that the online matches are relatably short, is an advantage, as you can experience gameplay in different areas, Mastermind difficulty and strategies, and fellow survivor characters. This game deserves more players!!! Com'on guys! I'm waiting for you to escape together!"
77405959,english,0,952070,"Had good potential, but it lacks balancing.  The game is unbalanced at low rank on both sides. As a survivor you don't have enough equipment/unlocks to fight high rank masterminds. As a low rank mastermind, you don't have enough equipment/unlocks to fight high rank survivors. Being required to play 40+ hours disadvantaged just to get on a level playing field will drive away all new players.  The game also fatally suffers from each match being hosted by the Mastermind, who benefits greatly from having a bad connection by making everyone else lag. If you get pitted against a russian Mastermind, might as well Alt+f4 cause it won't be playable.  More balancing and polish would be needed for this game to succeed, as it is, it's critically low on player count and steadily dying."

This was by far the most fun multiplayer Resident Evil experience I have EVER had! There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about playing this game! They broke this game for the benefit of a different multiplayer game they made instead: Resident Evil ReVerse. But Resident Evil ReVerse isn't Resident Evil Resistance; Resident Evil ReVerse SUCKS.

I mean, first you should check yourself and notice how stupid you sound: Resident Evil is, in its core, and how everyone has ever perceived to be, a SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCE...  But worry not, Capcom has attempted to make this absolute ""cashgrab"" of a game, and the vision is there whether you like it or not: there is a premise: every survivor has got a set of skills, they work together to prank the killer, who's got a better skillset, and escape the laboratory... Now, Dead by Daylight worked because Behaviour Interactive does its absolute best to keep the game balanced, and without hackers... Capcom? Hah, I know exactly what goes on in Capcom's head department: ""Well, let's add the Resident Evil name to it, and leave it for dead, people WILL play it, because they love Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, even with hackers"". That's funny because the game is an absolute GHOST TOWN right now.  I've been in queue for half an hour, and finally somebody joins and my entire pc slows down by like 170 frames per second... Being knowledgeable about how online games work, I immediatly told myself: ""How the F does Capcom allow Cheat Engine to run in an ONLINE game?"". Also, who came up with the idea of having the ""MasterMinds"", the supposed-to-be ANTAGONISTS in a RESIDENT EVIL game, to look like and be really just normal individuals... How am I supposed to believe that Annette was just working as a nurse all day long in a private clinic, then she got bored and started summoning zombies in the laboratory... Poor delusional Capcom lol they make lies, believe them and try to shove them down people's throats and it never goes well lol  Hopefully, the game can be 100%d even at this state, all you have to do is find a friend to do the achievements with, OR, if you've got 0 friends like me, grab your other second-hand laptop and log into your other Steam account and play with yourself till you get all the achievements haha. This is a [b]1/10[/b] miserable attempt at reaching Behaviour Interactive's level, but you know Capcom? Maybe you should stay in YOUR LANE... Be as woke as you want, but maybe don't try your hands at multiplayer games that are not FIGHTING games...

There's so much equipment and skill sets to unlock and experiment for both Survivors and Masterminds which allows for a huge array of costumization, making you wish to keep on trying different builds. The voice acting for the game is also what gives it charm, especially the Masterminds. Both voice actors and voice actresses did a phenomenal job. The soundtrack is also something to admire. Each map has it's own different background music to set up the mood for your surroundings and it even changes according to what's going on at the moment; for example, the music gets more intense whenever a Mastermind controls a zombie. As for the cosmetics, there's [b]a lot[/b] of them, ranging from sprays to weapon skins to even zombie skins (for Masterminds). You're bound to find something that you'll like amongst all of them. The downside is that the game's population isn't exactly big, however, it's still possible to find matches without waiting too long.

127667414,english,1,952070,"I loved the idea and gameplay. Resistance wants (or wanted?) to be a great piece of amazing experiences for players with its joyful gameplay, physics and graphics, but fails to achieve this because of lack of support from Capcom...   I don't understand why Capcom decided to abandon a great idea, I'm sure it would've been of the best and most-played games of this genre if they had advertised it differently (maybe sold as a standalone game, free to play, etc) and decided to have dedicated servers and a proper anti-cheat system. They left this to dead, at some point they started to see this idea as an evil resident in their company, and unfortunately, Resistance cannot resist the fall of player base due to lack of faith from its creator.   Although I deeply wish (and pray) that Capcom reconsiders their decisions and starts working to get this amazing game up and running, for now, unfortunately I have to say that this game is not worth the price, but if I marked it as recommended, it's maybe on the hope that, as I said, Capcom rethinks its decisions."

XP boosters and lootboxes in an already expensive game does not make it better.  The game also makes for imbalanced matches due to the fact that there is no matchmaking, and the setup of the game mechanics also makes for heavily sided matches.   You most of the time know that you will get a godlike opponent and your team will most of the time suck.   Also the map design is really annoying and bad. (Latest patch bought at least one actually playable map without cramped corridors, still though 90% of maps are worthless design and the mini-map don't help a dime for finding your way in maps with more than one floor)  There are also extremely annoying animations for everything you do.  Lots of troll teammates.  Community is unfriendly.  [u]Good things:[/u]  At least it is pretty fun to play MM. And when you actually have a working game it can be fun to play survivor too."

98422277,english,0,952070,"This game used to be fun for me when it first came out to the point I didn't mind playing Solo Q but I mostly played with a full squad of survivors. But then I ran into a few games where the Masterminds were Hackers and there was just nothing to do but get killed relentlessly and watch the time just zoom down to 0 for a Game Over. Last time I played was when they added Nemesis in as a Mastermind which seemed completely broken as a Special Unit. He had a Rocket Launcher that I believed One Shotted most anyone. The final downside was this game didn't have enough of a community as you can only get this game if you buy Resident Evil 3. If this game was either Free with in Game purchases or a Small fee like $10/15 while still being Bundled with RE3 then it would of been great and could of had a lot more of a player base but would of needed the Devs to really take care of the game and get rid of the hackers and adjust the balance.   TL;DR: Game Had Great Potential BUT Hackers, Lack of a Sizable Community, and Unfair Balance Ruined It!"

86477459,english,1,952070,"I played this game for almost 200 hours on ps4. Now I finally have it on PC and I'm sad to see that the reception is bad. I played a little and I didn't find any cheaters so far. This game DOES need cross play (and anti cheat if it's not true) It's sad that you have to buy Resident Evil 3 to be able to play it even. It's everything you love that makes RE2 and 3 challenging. Except in the form of a coop game. The fact that the master mind is player controlled makes it so that every match is quite random. There are soooo many strategies that they can effectively use.  Do you like shooting zombies and using your wits to survive while solving objectives in dynamic modern survival horror combat and level traversal? Then this game is for you!!! There are many types of zombies, many builds you can make, many ways to play to survive and avoid being bit. Many ways to save your team and turn the tides to your favor doing awesome plays. Like for example when you get bit or die you lose time. The remaining match time determines whether you win or lose. If you do an objective or hurt/kill zombies you gain time. You can dodge through a bunch of zombies and use the right weapons to make room to move... Just to get to an objective across and then save the match that way. It's even better when your team has your back while doing it! There are many ways to play and many master mind tricks to look out for. I was just shot gunning one of the bio cores with a yellow herb, shooting dogs that were circling me at the same time while my team was panicking across the room in a crowd of zombies haha  All the resident evil challenges we love in the other survival horror RE games are here and it plays really great with all the deep mechanics!"
85537858,english,0,952070,The game is fun but support for it is basically dead and the only way it could be worth buying is if they didn't bundle it with RE3. I got it on sale for $20 but I would have easily payed $30 for what was a good time.
66909236,english,1,952070,"I think RE: Resistance could be a really good game given a fair opportunity, but you can blame Capcom (not Neobards) for ***** it up with poor distribution, lack of faith in supporting the game with dedicated servers, and not having anti-cheat. The game uses peer-to-peer connections so as the community declined, the matches became very unstable for the survivors. It also created a lot of toxicity in the community because the survivors naturally blame the host for the ""lag-switching"", even though it's just a bad connection that tends to get worse with the higher creature limit. Some people like to blame Neobards for not supporting the game which is not true, I have been playing since day one with 700+ hours, and the developers have pushed many good, and admittedly not so good balancing/content updates. To be fair, there are some balancing issues that make it very difficult for new players to pick up the game, specifically ""gun and mine decks"" that require a specific character with an optimized build.  Personally, I still enjoy the game because it has a very high skill ceiling, even after hundreds of hours I still learn new strategies for the mastermind and survivors to some extent. People don't give Resistance the credit for how complex it is, there are so many different ways to play each mastermind, not to mention that each map creates a different dynamic. The game is not very noob friendly, it takes at least 200 hours to be a worthwhile teammate, and it only takes one bad player to drag the entire team down. After the latest balancing patch, you would be lucky to win 30% of your survivor games in random which is certainly not a positive experience. Many players can't tell the difference between cheats and good players because the combination of certain cards can create some very abusive combination. When the Nicholai was introduced into the game, It felt like about half of the community rage quit because of uninteractive gun decks - they have been nerfed significantly, but you could still argue that gun decks are more effective overall.   Most importantly, Resistance can be a very fun game when you get those close matches with a good connection. I love the characters because they have so much personality, and I love the gameplay depth that it provides. There is just something really fun about being a ""bad guy"" and doing map presents, working out the best way to kill 4 people. For me it was the first asymmetrical multiplayer, I know there are other popular games that provide a better experience, but I guess I just have a misplaced sense of loyalty for this game, probably because it's based in Resident Evil lore. I honestly hope that we see characters like Daniel and January in other resident evil titles, I think they provide more flavor to what is otherwise is a very generic cast of characters if we being completely honest. Additionally, game has a deck-building aspect with many moving parts, adding a lot variety, experimenting and replay value.   [i] The cast of survivors makes the game feel like a cheesy horror movie, there is just something fun about roleplaying as stereotypes in a bad situation which reminds me of ""Friday the 13th"". [/i]  [h1] Pros: [/h1]  + I love the characters, both survivors and masterminds  + very high skill ceiling, good gameplay depth + ability to customize map presets and decks + many enjoyable character skins, even for zombies + fun roreplaying aspect  [h1] Cons: [/h1]  [u] Abusive Decks [/u] - there are certain decks that take advantage of characters that can't directly interact with you. Usually, those decks involve something to do with cameras or trap activation, like shield resets or just camera durability. You will find that sometimes your team just does not have the right tools for a fair fight, and even if you do, it could take a lot of perfect decisions. More recently, they introduced a toxic ""immunity"" mechanics which makes it unclear when to fight enemies.   [u] Distribution [/u] - It should be a free game with any RE purchase, it can't just be a RE3 tumor because it's a completely different game with a different audience. The smaller the community, the more likely you are to get a laggy match. It's peer to peer so it's not like they need money for hosting servers.   [u] Connection [/u] - due to the community decline, you will get matches with people in different regions, making the game borderline unplayable, or impossible on stage 3.  [b] Overall Thoughts: [/b]  As much as some people want to crap on Resistance I think those opinions are based on incomplete information or simply blaming the game for things that devs had little control over. To be fair the game is dead and there are many reasons for it, both in the game and outside of the game. Given a different mindset with distribution and content support, I think it could be a different story. I enjoyed it while it lasted, and I will play it from time to time with what remains of the community... Now I just hope that we can see some of the survivors in the new RE games - can you imagine Barry actually meeting Martin Sandwich...

105686635,english,1,952070,"Getting the RE 2 mod for this makes it 10x better! It's really fun to play with friends especially. I will say that this game does have an unbalanced system, for example, you can be a level 25 and go against a mastermind level 200. No one is ever too OP though. Often, you are playing against the same people and you learn to counter them as you keep going against them. It is a very fast paced game and it is fun to try and win at the last second!"

I don't recommend because it really isn't being maintained anymore and it also has a lot of really big problems."

116882201,english,1,952070,"This game is pretty fun as a concept, but as it's executed it just feels too one sided. Everything is stacked against the Mastermind if the Survivors have any understanding of what they're doing."
113094909,english,1,952070,"This game was done dirty. Its actually really good, but tacking it onto RE3 instead of making it a standalone caused a lot of review bombing, and the devs basically gave up on supporting it. Its a shame really."
112255811,english,0,952070,"Look, I'm glad Capcom tried something new with Resistance, and to be honest, I do get a little enjoyment out of playing, but I cannot deny that the game is in an awful state, and there are a LOT of glaring issues with it.  Let's not beat around the bush and just get into it.  The matchmaking system is atrocious. It's so horrifically unbalanced to the point that if I had to chug an entire bottle of beer for every high-leveled player, both on the Survivor and Mastermind sides, I would've died of alcohol poisoning after what, 3 matches? It also takes forever to find a match sometimes, the queue times are so incredibly inconsistent. I nearly hit 20 minutes one time trying to find a 5th player. I wish I was kidding.  Playing as the Survivor usually goes a few different ways.  -Get carried through the entire match because the level 257 player can weave through the entire map unscathed, grab every single key item in a single blink, and have everybody make it out before you even get a chance to realize what just happened. -Get left behind CONSTANTLY because of basically ZERO communication between Survivors. Yeah, there are ""emotes"", but those can only do so much. There's no text/voice chat whatsoever, so you just have to pray that you can keep up with everybody else, because they sure as hell aren't gonna wait for you. -Usually end up running out of time because trying to rush as fast as possible to the exit while also watching out for traps doesn't exactly mix well. -Most likely get stuck in the first area because spamming everything you have as the Mastermind works surprisingly well, and fail because apparently, you’re supposed to push through Lickers that will down you in two hits, or worse, cameras that can shoot at you and can also down you incredibly quickly. Seriously, the Nikolai update RUINED this game. -Have at least one person disconnect at some point during the match, crippling your team and usually means you’re not making it to the end. -Or, and this is a favorite, have EVERYBODY ELSE disconnect, leaving you alone with the Mastermind as they spam everything they have behind the very first door.  Now playing as the Mastermind you would think would be the saving grace, right? What do you think?  -Watch as the matchmaking system makes your life hell as it pairs you up against an entire team of gold-wearing Survivors, all with triple-digit levels and able to take down everything you throw at them with ease. -Feel bad as you totally destroy a clearly new player being shoved in with people who have 3,000+ hours because as I mentioned, the matchmaking is atrocious. -Have the Survivors breeze through all of your traps and enemies because the Mastermind controls are so unintuitive and sluggish that by the time you have a room set up with clever traps and well-placed enemies, the Survivors have already left the Area. -Trying the spam “technique” that apparently works so well when you’re playing as a Survivor, but have it backfire on you so miserably that you might as well just leave the match and uninstall.  The lag is HORRENDOUS. It will literally take entire SECONDS after you’ve shot an enemy for the damage to pop up. Try to empty an entire magazine or absolutely beat the crap out of an enemy with a melee weapon? There's a very high chance that the game will just give you a middle finger and say you missed EVERYTHING. There's a few times where you'll walk down a hallway perfectly fine, and then all of a sudden get downed because apparently, you were getting shot at by a camera that entire time, because again, SCREW the Nikolai update. And on top of it all, you also have a high chance to miss every other turn because even though you clearly hit left, you’ll keep running forwards for a couple more seconds, and THEN finally have your input register as you turn right into an enemy that downs you, and get left alone as apparently all the other Survivors are already at the Exit while you just barely made it to where the first key was supposed to be. I think the biggest reason why the lag is so awful is because Capcom made the baffling decision to use P2P connections. Are dedicated servers really just so unfathomable to developers?  Lootcrates, anyone? Because in order to get ANY upgrades or cosmetics for your characters, you have to go through them. And of course, playing matches will only get you a certain amount of points to buy said crates, even LESS if you fail. The only way to max out how many? You basically have to do a flawless run. EVERY TIME. Yeah, you can use RP Boosters to increase the amount of points you get, but they only last for so long. But hey, you can always buy more. WITH REAL MONEY.  There are an embarrassing amount of glitches too, like trying to pick a Survivor just... not working as you're stuck on the menu until someone inevitably leaves. Or have your mouse randomly stop working, forcing you to plug in a controller just to continue playing. And my favorite, going to pick up an item on the last Area of a match, only for the game to freak the f**k out and literally teleport you outside the map, making you unable to move and be forced to watch as every other Survivor leaves without you.  What sucks the most is that I can totally see the potential of this game, I do enjoy the game when it works and doesn't lag out to all hell, the characters are unique and interesting, the gameplay, while flawed, could totally work, and the general idea is rock-solid and with some more love and dedication, I think this could be a fantastic game if Capcom actually put forward the effort to fix it and make it better... but sadly, something tells me that Capcom won't do that anytime soon. Or ever.  And again, SCREW the Nikolai update."
77051175,english,0,952070,"I like the escape room concept but there are so many flaws in this game.  FLAWS Timer is way too short. Never enough time. It's like you're expected to know exactly where all the key items are and if you have all the supplies needed like lots of ammo and melee.  I understand that all Resident Evil games, EXCEPT 4 and later, have very small pouches (girls have purses boys have fanny packs) so they can only carry 8 items. Definitely not enough space. 16 or more spaces would be perfect.  Random people are mostly players who want to have fun while this game is so difficult that requires pure skill.  Best to play when you have a team, clan, or guild or close friends who play this with you so you can practice, discuss, or even use voice chat.  It is true what they say about the mastermind or I like to call it (security guard, lol. Get it? Their main work purpose is monitoring and alerting) They are too overpowered and 8 out of 10, they win.  It took me awhile to find key items, there should be a arrow above the characters head that points a direction where you need to go like a compass instead of checking the map, when you browse the map, the mastermind takes this wonderful opportunity to kill you because you are ""afk"".  DESTROYING THE WATER TANKS TAKE FOREVER, A LOT OF TIME CONSUMED. Expect 3 to 10 minutes. And you need to break 4 of them total.  If all the things I posted were updated in favor of the survivors and I mean a huge buff to survivors and a huge NERF to mastermind then you would get more positive reviews.  CONCLUSION This game is only playable singleplayer on free mode, plenty of time, money, and supplies. You gotta be lucky or very popular to play this with people you know and people you practice with.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! WASTE OF CPU MEMORY!"
90692945,english,1,952070,"RE:Resistance is an arcade style randomly generated 1v4 horror game. Firstly, this game is done. There is no more development being worked on, whatever we have is what we have - and we have a lot for what we've gotten. The game can be a bit difficult to get into because you have to get equipment to add to your characters / mastermind or survivor / as MM this means you might be getting your shit kicked in for a bit till you can afford some high level equipment, and as survivor - you can get by without full equipment; but if the MM Is tricked out you might feel overwhelmed by the zombies. This can often give players the perception that the MM Is ""hacking"" when infact its just that they have alot of equipment / levels over you. But, because the game has such a low population - it's difficult for it to match players that are at close levels, so this might happen occasionally, but with the recent sale i've been getting more players in the lower levels of things. I play this game entirely solo as i dont have any friends who are masochistic enough to play this with me all night, but despite this - I still manage to have lots of  fun when im not lagging out because of the MM's connection, or we're being hacked to death. and most if not all the time it's the former. But in the small moments where everything is working as intended :tm: the game absolutely shines. The characters are fully voiced beautifully, the director of the VAs was ON it. They interact with each other and the environment, their voicelines are so clear and crisp and are VERY reactive. it's very immersive. The atmosphere is incredible, and you'll often find yourself stopping to soak in the air while your team is getting mauled to death by and E.I.S zombie. The MM's are very wellwritten - each having unique traits and playstyles that shows in every aspect of the personality. Ontop of that, we also get to design custom loadouts for every character, MM or survivor. This includes changing how your passive / active / ultimate works, and of course those equipments that can increase your durability/damage/health and even decrease negative effects. We also have VERY unique cosmetics for every character/weapon we even have dances you can unlock that you can perform as a zombie when playing MM or as a survivor - and the meme level of those is high af  To be honest, capcom shit the bed with this one - the game had alot of potential, but now it lives in a small cave, being worshipped by a cult following. If you're buying RE3 JUST to play this, please wait for a sale - you will feel so much better about the price tag when you are dealing with laggy connections, and when youre getting shat on by mechanics while learning.  Like, there IS a learning curve - and it is kind of hightened because you wont be playing with complete shitter masterminds always, or complete shitter survivors. But understand that once you get the equipment you need the load starts to become alot more manageable and you'll find yourself having more fun than you were before  PS:  only buy high tier equipment  PPS: also barging into doors is a negative frame please just let your tyrone kick it in or let jill lockpick it - if you have to barge in have someone train a gun on the door behind you"

74572924,english,1,952070,"I had been having so much fun with this game, and I started to get tired of it by the fourth or fifth month, playing every single night. It still is extremely thrilling to play with friends and very challenging to play randomly. It's great to play as all the characters, who have fully-realised concepts, by the way. I love their voice lines and backstories. The game had monthly updates, but it was over by November. The mechanics and graphics are better than ever for the franchise, although there are stressful moments like zombies chain-grabbing you in a small area or several dogs and lickers jumping at you non-stop... But as a fan, I do enjoy it.  Playing as Mastermind is quite amusing as well... There's something evil about cornering survivors with waves of buffed creatures, locking doors behind them and laying traps on the stairs and watching them fall for them. There's something thrilling about playing Spencer and saying ""I'm doing this for humanity... Humanity needs me as a God. Don't you agree?""  However, there are serious issues with this game, the biggest being the absence of dedicated servers and anti-cheat system, as well as how unbalanced it feels in the beginning. By playing it, I did get frustrated a lot coming across Masterminds (which are the villains, and ironically, the hosts of the matches) who either cheat or have terrible network connections, making the match lag so hard that I have seen zombie dogs fly. In the beginning, you might want to quit this game for good because it is so unfair for players without any experience since you will have a hard time trying to go up against death squads (if you play as the MM) or well-prepared villains (if you play as the survivors), all levelled up at high ranks and full of stuff at their disposal while you have nothing (nearly nothing).  Apart from that, the game is really cool, and I love the costumes available in-game for free as well. Such a shame many people don't recognise the potential of this entry and it pains me to see such an amazing game die so quickly."

If q times in 2020 were eternal, you can imagine how it is now, mostly cheaters or high mms masterminds.  This game was so fresh and brand new, the perfect Resident Evil themed multiplayer, lots of grind and almost the perfect competition to dbd... But if Capcom doesn't give updates, dedicated servers or anticheats, less people will care. If you call a peak of 60 players per month playing Re Resistance a playerbase, then this game is well dead, thank you Capcom for not even trying to keep up, the same thing will happen to Re:verse.  Recommended if you own a time machine and somehow you manage to go back to april 2020, nowadays you are just paying money for RE3 Remake."

131452937,english,1,952070,"RE: Resistance is a [b]dead game[/b]. Very few players, hackers, bots that antagonize new players, crappy matchmaking, terrible netcode, no anti-cheat, lacking QoL features, and piss-poor balance. The game only received updates for six months.  Does anybody [i]actually[/i] like that type of model? Stop releasing multiplayer spin-offs tied to some other purchase. Stop releasing multiplayer games with a live-service model only to stop updating them after 6 months. Commit and have faith in your product. Let people purchase the game separately, or do a F2P model... [i]but don't lock it behind some other game[/i].  Development was rushed to match RE3R's release. It took a ton of blame for RE3R's sub-optimal launch and review-bombing, and for its overpriced cost (triple-A pricing despite CAPCOM's marketing team recommending against it). Its restricted availability and scapegoated existence make it look unappealing. These games are [i]fine[/i] on their own – they don't need to be attached together. RE: Resistance didn't even have an RE3R content until several months later – so why were these game packaged together?  I mean... [b][i]Damn[/i][/b], I really love a [b]fun[/b] asymmetrical game. This is such a fun game. The core game idea is great, it meshes well with the franchise it uses (without needing to rely solely on the license either!), and it had ample room to grow both its preexisting mechanics and potential for new ideas. Public matchmaking is terrible, but if you have 2-4 friends it's pretty fun despite the balancing. I'd love for CAPCOM to release an asymmetrical RE game that they're actually confident in, gave the proper time and resources to, and plan to maintain longer than 6 months."

89859017,english,0,952070,"It's a nice attempt, but when you create a game that nobody asked for and make it so without actual servers, it's bound to go down in flames.  Pros - Good concept, game play is fun. Cons - No official servers, means peer to peer connection, meaning horrible lag in almost every game, and game can end if host is losing and decides to leave the match. Almost no players on PC. And Hackers galore.   Instead, remake Resident Evil Outbreak File 1 & 2. It'd be major hits."
188136894,english,0,952070,"Resistance is a 4v1 multiplayer game set in the Resident Evil universe where players need to work together as they try to escape different scenarios, all the while the Mastermind player attempts to stop them by deploying traps and enemies. In theory this game certainly had potential, however in execution there is a lot left to be desired. Issues with balancing are blatant, with some characters and masterminds being a lot more useful than others, often creating unevenness in matches. The game itself is very repetitive, as the objectives don't vary all that much. Matchmaking is generally atrocious. The player base never really caught on so finding a match can take ages and often when you do, there are loads of cheaters that suck whatever enjoyment remains. Capcom seems to have pretty much abandoned support for it at this point. Give this title a miss, even if you're a big fan of the RE series."
124565809,english,0,952070,"80 percent of the time is in torturous waiting time, and during waiting time the server may even tell you that there are players quitting, and then you have to repeat the long queue.  Many MMs are laggy. I don't know whether it is because the area is too far away, the server is faulty, or the MM got internet problem. XD Anyway I like this game very much as a biohazard fan but I don't recommend to play it. : (  2023.04.17 added: This game is literally broken by bots, you cannot find matches as MM in random. If you are a veteran and planning for a return, I suggest you to go for custom. There are some static people playing custom games every day but it's kinda hard to level up due to the point you earn from custom is really low. Rookie? I suggest you go find something else to play.  如果是国人的话，野排已经死了。建议加我好友拉你进开黑群，人够了一般会发车玩自定义，也能体验这个游戏，不过自定义给的经验很少，很难升级，对新人很不友好。"

Sometimes there's lag too which can be a problem, but this game is still in its early stages and they have fixed a lot since it's release!   I've put in over 1,000 hours into this game and I still love it! I find the reviews this game has right now unfair personally. Find yourself a team too, you'll have a better time! Learn the game, don't give up. If you love Dead By Daylight or any other asymmetrical games, you will love this too, just practice and learn it, it does become fun once you find your playstyle!

76801053,english,0,952070,"Friends let me start like this, disappointing The multiplayer part of the third version is not interesting at all and has a lot of in-app payments, which forces you to buy and upgrade faster and access equipment to fight and advance. This title was supposed to be sold separately, but It was sold together with the third version. Unfortunately, it is not of good quality and has nothing to do with your experience. The game servers are empty and you have to wait a long time to go to the competition and experience it. And very soon this title will disappoint you. May be.  دوستان بذارید اینطور شروع کنم،ناامید کننده بخش چند نفره بازسازی نسخه سوم،اصلا جالب نیست و پرداخت های درون برنامه ای بسیاری دارد،که شما رو مجبور به خرید و ارتقا سریع تر و دسترسی به تجهیزات برای مبارزه و پیشروی میکند.این عنوان قرار بود به صورت جداگانه به فروش برسد ولی با نسخه سوم یکجا فروخته شد متاسفانه کیفیت خوبی ندارد و چیزی ندارد که شما رو به تجربه آن مشغول کند.سرور های بازی خالی هستند و مجبورید انتظار های طولانی بکشید برای رفتن به رقابت و تجربه آن.و خیلی زود این عنوان برای شما ناامید کننده میشود."

119557540,english,1,952070,"Do not listen to the negative reviews, give this game a try and make up your own opinion. Play both survivors and Mastermind, the latter is especially unique and there is no other game that has this game mechanic. I ignored reviews and tried this game out, it has hooked me, I play it alot its a fun game once you get the hang of it. The hardest part is the beginning because many people are experienced and skill difference is high between new players and veterans, but once you get to know the basics its really fun. The only downside is the absence of dedicated servers, p2p connection makes games for survivors often laggy, because of the small playerbase its likely that Mastermind(who is host) is far away in the world. The playerbase is small but is very active, so you always find matches between 1-5 minutes usually, if you select Random in Quick Match. The only blame should not be given to this game but Capcom who did not give this game the treatment it deserved, this game has a lot of wasted potential."
191466572,english,1,952070,"5/10 - I don't know even who is the audience for this game, but unexpectadly I enjoyed it!  Received this game as a bonus for Resident Evil 3 remake pre-order, never cared about it and never planned to play it, but since then I start grinding for achivs. Heard that the games servers will be shut down in summer, so I assumed it's time to play it now or never.  Visually it's what you saw in RE2RE and RE3RE - a good looking game. Yet level design is a luckluster, I don't know how difficult it is to make balanced and yet captivated locations so I might be wrong in this, but they definitely could make it better and more memorable. Not even a single stage impressed me, yet almost all of them have some parts of the stage that I really like.  Music and sounds, overall pretty good, more or less memorable music, well delivered lines by masterminds and survivors, good-decent sounds on everything else.  Gameplay - four survivors vs mastermind, while survivors try to make an objective and escape from stage, mastermind tries to stop them with everything they got. Doesn't sound all to great on paper, but actually might be a lot of fun. Why ""might"" be you ask? First of all P2P connection, you might be from UK while you opponent will be from japan, but sometimes it will feel like he is from Saturn. Because its P2P you will find yourself playing against some ""pluggers"", you got fine/tolerable connection in stage 1 and terrible at stage 3, up to forced disconnect. And of course we got cheaters, there is not that much of them (because there is not that much players) but they are here. There is some veterans in the game, not to mention they know the game in and out unlike you, they also got all abilities and perks/equipment unlocked which puts you into serious disadvantage. The last one is balance, I didn't play this game as long as others, but it feels survivors are in favour, 4 survivor veterans will pulvaryze veteran mastermind, IF one of them will be unlucky, ""how is that?"" the thing is when you choose your survivor/mastermind you don't know who you will play against and won't make a hard counterpick.Although I said I enjoyed it, It wasn't very intresting to play as survivor, yet playing as mastermind was quite enjoyable for me.  I hope RESISTANCE 2 will come out someday (it probably won't), because I do see a potential in the game, but you need to put more effort and faith in this project Capcom ."
85457326,english,0,952070,"If you are a newby DON'T play in this game. Matchmaking is an absolute joke. For example you start as Mastermind Rank 1 and the game puts survivors Rank 100 against you. Or as Survivor Rank 1 you get to fight Mastermind Rank 100. And there are literally only 100 people playing this game daily. I suppose the game had bigger online in spring 2020, but now it's dead. The sad thing is that I think the RE:SISTANCE is pretty fun. The gameplay is interesting and it's fun to play this kind of game  in the RE Universe. But I really can’t feel good about it right now. So take my advice, if you just bought Resident Evil 3, don't bother yourself even downloading RE:SISTANCE. Save your time and disc space on your PC."
139326727,english,0,952070,"[h1] Review[/h1]  Since RE3 was such a short game for a semi-full price game adding some sort of Multiplayer is definitely not a bad idea if the multiplayer is actually fun an interesting. RE5 and 6 had a much longer game and shipped or later on added various multiplayer coop or vs modes. This one goes the hardest route I can imagine: asymmetrical gameplay in a pvp environment.  [u]Gameplay[/u] Here is the kicker. I cannot really describe the gameplay because you cannot play the game anymore. Not only is the player base low but also, aside private matches, public matchmaking is not possible. Its necessary for unlocking cosmetics or abilities and permanent modifications.   Matchmaking is not possible as the player who is the Mastermind will most of the time get a glitched lobby. I´ve been told that the reason for that is the hacks of someone. Bots will directly try to join a Masterminds lobby and immediately leave and rejoin or some weird stuff like that. So, in 2 hours of searching, I managed to find (my) premade group as the mastermind twice.  The core gameplay is as far as I can see not actually that bad. You have four survivor with various abilities and playstyles and a mastermind who tries to kill or damage the player and thus lowering the time they have to escape. The game has three stages, first a key/puzzle piece hunt, then a keycard hunt where the person who has the keycard has to interact with various terminals and at last you have to destroy three power cores to escape. A game usually takes around 10-20 minutes.  The mastermind places traps and monsters depending on a complex card and resource system. He also has to use cameras whom can be shot. I cannot say really how balanced it is but I doubt it is balanced in any way aside playing it very casually. If people remember the camera positions or pick characters that are op (I heard certain survivors make certain masterminds obsolete, characters like Jill or Becca are very often picked. Mastermind Nikolai also seems hated as he solely works by spamming traps and trying to shoot down a survivor with a camera gun when he cannot move.  [u]Story[/u] None, just random villains and aside Jill who got added later on there are survivors created just for this game.   [u]Sound[/u] From an absolute banger of a main menu theme towards more environmental songs that step up in certain situations this game got it all. Really great ost that doesn’t have to hide from the rest of the franchise. Even got voice acting in a couple of languages too!  [u]Graphics[/u] While it does take the same style and graphics of RE2/3 there is a downgrade. It does have a few interesting animations, especially in melee combat with various zombie finisher, it does have a worse quality. Probably got downgraded due to the online portion.  [u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u] All in all playing a few rounds with friends was really fun. There are a lot of problems with this mode, being unplayable at the moment wasn’t its final nail in the coffin. Bad balancing for a game system like that it had a lack of support from the developer and I also heard, aside the currently hacked lobbies, that people back then managed to solely hack the game with cheat engine. Yeah no wonder it died directly.  Broken and dead multiplayer game"
67754177,english,0,952070,"As a matter of fact, I had to force myself to meditate and calm down before exploding in anger in the course of writing this review. why did I bother to write this review? maybe I wanted to complain about what made me feel uncomfortable; thus I could feel better.  The game is set in the in vivo experiment base with human beings by Umbrellas. The game rules are simple: the experimenter tries to stop survivors from escaping, and the survivors try to escape with using their resources.  The characters have their own skills and have to crate well-organized strategies so that they will escape from the grasp of the villain experimenter. The game plays under this big framework.  At a glance, it may feel like a survival game, like Dead by Daylight, but it deserves praise for its differentiating elements, including high quality graphic and character design.  There is nothing more to be desired in the game as long as the overall package is concerned. ""survivors work together to create a strategy and fight against experimenter with their own strategies."" A wonderful development of story is anticipated like a beautiful painting. A closer look at its various aspects, however, will reveal that the game is full of problems to which any game enthusiasts would shake their heads.  If only those who love Resident Evil play this game, the small-sized users will not matter. When cheating is prevalent among users, however, things are different. The number of users are already small for this game, but players who cheat extort common users and smile an evil smile behind of a screen. just thinking of this possibility can make disappoint who have been excited to play the game.  If you come across players whose IDs Start with ***, seven in ten cases will turn out to be cheaters. If they are experimenters, you will face endless bombardment by machine guns with numerous zombies around.  The next problem I would lie to point out concerns the network. when the host network is unstable, the players on the surviving side will experience such inconvenience that their game environment becomes uncomfortable. This game only has a small of users. If its host network is unstable you will experience more than simple game play; you will find yourself sitting helpless while vacantly looking at the bloody red monitor after getting beaten by the host experimenter while not being able to do anything.  When you come across cheaters, who usually play on the experimenter side and have IDs starting with ***, there is a big possibility that they are Chinese. Even if there is no cheating, users on the experimenter side are asked o practice a high level of control. Since cheaters can pour out the abilities of an experimenter with no limits, they must prefer the experimenter role for convenience.  I came across a Chinese player that overused cheats and was subjected to no restrictions. I can imagine them deceiving and mocking other honest users and smiling wickedly behind their anonymous ID starting with *** while continuing to cheat right at that moment. You will get a bonus, too, which is their mockery of the manager's inability and celebration of great China.  I feel bad thinking of some players around the world getting tormented by cheaters on resident Evil. My biggest concern is that there is nothing to console the users that were tormented by cheaters and left the game as no media or means of communications has criticized these cheating players.  Can we expect a game culture of respecting and treating those who do play fair with no tricks and deception in this game? If you come across an experimenter and feel suspicious you'd better log out of game and pray that you will not get a match with this Chinese player next time."
156994774,english,0,952070,"This game has potential, but like what other reviews have said, without dedicated server, Mastermind is always the host, thus they can lag switch so survivors can't do anything but to lose.   If you are new, winning as Mastermind is impossible without equipment, and you get matched with high level survivors with equipment who have been playing for years.  There are only handful of active players, after playing for a few hours, you can remember their names and know who is the lag switchers, and who is the toxic teammate blocking objective with items or not getting into gate for next area. Some are online every day because they lag switch to make sure they win when they start losing, there is no point playing against them.  And also, low player count means half your time is playing queue simulator.  In summary, it might be fun for the first few games, but don't even download this, it will waste your time."

82639255,english,1,952070,"Resident Evil Resistance is to say the least, a beautiful monstrosity. In nearly every way possible, this game was strangled, chained for death, and left abandoned, yet there are still many who hold on because there is still so much potential in this game. Despite the plentiful issues, player base toxicity, lag, hacking, questionable design choices, OP Survivor/ Mastermind builds, over-reliance of RNG in mechanics, and lack of teamwork (On and on), there is still so much enjoyment to be had in this game; But alas, that one good game every so often that makes all the absolutely terrible rounds in between worthwhile, is becoming rarer and rarer.  Everyone has known since day one that it should have been sold separately. That one caveat to getting this game immensely hindered its growth. Even without Dedicated Servers, at least there would have been a steady starting player base and coupled with a lesser price for entry, and months of updates, laggy games would have been less frequent, as there would have possibly been more local people to play with which would aid overall enjoyment. As the player base dwindles the games have to reach further and further for players which exacerbates the games lag, as well as it's many flaws. It's truly a vicious cycle. This issue was made even more troublesome when the updates stopped coming and everyone dropped ship, due to heartbreak and the ever worsening state of the game.  Also, I gotta say, this game's store page is absolutely abysmal, the lone 5 pre-released pictures and the all red Recent/All Review Ratings expedited, and was a product of, its ever-increasing irrelevance and popular decline which is sad to see. From the get-go this game is niche, survival horror and especially an Outbreak/Mercenaries style game was a risk, but despite all that, they somehow made a compelling and fun experience. The game's identity problem, lack of direction and faith in the work really shows with how its left in its currently state. If a stranger somehow stumbled on this games store page without any prior knowledge, I highly doubt they would think under all that mediocrity that there is actually a great game laying neglected underneath.  Resistance has made me feel many strong emotions. May they be of pure anger and frustration from constant terrible solo-que matches, bliss and euphoria from a difficult but ever rewarding close game, or simply joy from the little things that make each game played unique and fun. Resistance is amazing, it's my ugly duckling and I love it to pieces. But those that feel similarly know of the deep sadness and just disappointment seeing the game withering away every week to only disappear into obscurity.  Despite the many flaws justly criticized by the player base, I do truly recommend this game because I know there are others out there like me, while knowing and experiencing its shortcomings, that will still find joy and a fulfilling challenge. It's just very unfortunate that this game is left as it is, it could have been so very fruitful if it was given a chance. No wonder why the player base is so morose, divided and spent."

This game divided on two different modes: survivor and mastermind, which one is differ each other a lot.  There are two different objectives of these modes. The survivors have to escape before time runs out, while mastermind ought to prevent them from escaping.  There are six different survivors which have unique skills that they have to use to cover each other and defeat creatures together.  Also, there are four different masterminds, which one of them have unique creatures and special weapon helps them to prevent survivors escape. [h1][b]Visuals[/b][/h1]  This game uses «RE Engine». Regardless of low system requirements, graphics looks great, there are a lot of different options and cinematic effects. As for a cursory glance the game looks more clearly than RE3. Also, optimization of the game is good just like other games on that engine.  The design of the maps looks awesome. Incredible attention to the details. [h1][b]Sound[/b][/h1] Suddenly, the composer of the game is Jeff Broadbent. Everything sounds great like it should be. Especially strands out the main theme.  Also there are a few mixes of tracks from the previous games, and they sounds great in environment of the game. [h1][b]The verdict[/b][/h1]  «Resident Evil: Resistance» is a great example of modern today online games, without any objective but extremely fun. It has great potential. It’s has everything it needs to the popular online game. There are a lot of great choices in the balance of the game, but it's not enough. There is room for improvement. It needs long support.  An indicated list of the issues to be resolved, in my humble opinion: 1) Dedicated servers; 2) Matchmaking improvements; 3) Balance improving, refinement; 4) Some sort of anti-cheat; 5) Cross-platform play."
140614279,english,0,952070,not good bad awfully bad i dont even see a point to say why it's bad burn this game with umbrella corps and resident evil survivor cds
120425824,english,0,952070,"saw this on my list and it reminded me i will never forgive capcom for shooting this game dead lol  my favourite horror asym game but i cannot in good consciousness recommend it because of how terribly it was handled. this thing had no chance. it was marketed so poorly that it was judged on the basis of it ""taking time/budget away from re3r"" and hated for that reason despite it having nothing to do with that game, just arbitrarily bundled with it. you cant buy this thing separately and to this day this steam page is still hidden (??????). horribly unbalanced in all manner of ways and incredibly unintuitive for new players. they failed to patch a lot of its problems out in a timely manner and as a result bled the majority of players in a matter of weeks. and then killed only after half a year before it could be developed any further :(  maybe capcom will learn with RE:verse oof"
68423065,english,0,952070,"TL;DR: The game is has soooo much potential, but is mired by massive balance issues (both for new players and for high level ones), terrible connectivity due to P2P networking, progression scaling that is very punishing to new players, zero intelligent, skill-based matchmaking, and an absurd amount of hackers.  So, first of all let me say I do actually *really* like this game. There's some serious potential in this game, and there's so many mechanics in place that a variety of playstyles can definitely be an option.  Now that that's out of the way, here's why you shouldn't play it, *yet*. The level scaling is ROUGH, for starters. You don't really feel like you're making any impact at all until you get a character to around level 7-10, which is about 4 hours of gameplay. It also matches you with max-ranked players incredibly frequently, regardless of whether or not you're playing mastermind or survivor; because the gear and skills scale so hard up to level 25, you will constantly be getting wrecked. An example is playing an L3 Annette (the first mastermind you can play) with only +8% to creature damage, while a L25 Becca is using a build that gives her literally +230% damage (we've done the math), and can kill your toughest creature in 0.5s.  The inverse is also true, Sam is a pretty broken character right now after level 11, but before that a max rank Daniel mastermind controlling a zombie can *literally* 2-shot you (he has a build that can 1-shot all but 2 characters).  The game is time based, so all gameplay is rush-rush-rush; new players are often left in the dust by their team just trying to figure out where they need to go, and smart masterminds punish that mistake *heavily*, causing you to throw the match by simply not knowing the map.  On top of that, the game is extremely unbalanced in favor of the survivors. Any sub-optimal mastermind build does little more than feed time to half-competent survivors because of poor balance, many builds use multiplicative modifiers to break mechanics (such as Valerie's Remedy Mixtape build that cuts her healing ult down from 150s to 87s, constantly clearing infection that takes over 100s to become effective, Becca's Bullet Storm Ult that will let her kill everything in sight, etc).  That takes me to my final balance gripe. The character Becca has an ult that allows her to have infinite ammo for 10s. This is all fine and balanced until you factor in that this also works on special weapons like the grenade launcher and rocket launcher that are literally balanced on ammo count; once you run out of ammo, the gun is destroyed. Becca can deal 32,000 AoE damage from any range every 87 seconds; the highest health monster has 2650 HP, and the three biocores at the final stage of each map has 16,000 HP. And yes, on 2 of the 4 maps currently in the game you can absolutely shoot two of the 3 biocores from a single location, killing both within 10 seconds.  Oh, and there's hackers. Lots of hackers, literally zero anti-cheat (you can't even kick players in-game for being afk, let alone report them for hacking)."
191593109,english,1,952070,"Well , I have to admit that this is the best game out there, all i can say is thank you CAPCOM for this game, (cause when i decided to buy some games This was in a bundle only.) and thank you to all the players that played and play with me. and for the cheaters , well i hope the next game doesn't have these flaws"
170364060,english,0,952070,"The game was abandoned 6 months after its initial release. Another heap of garbage bundled with a good game just like Reverse and Village  Stay away from this game like the plague. Either you will wait endlessly looking for a match or when you do, whoever runs the Master Mind will be running the game with full cheats rendering the whole thing unplayable. You have been warned......"
123311446,english,0,952070,"Playing mastermind surprisingly impossible, Cameras constantly shot, people rushing to objectives, its a dead game that people grind survivor on, im a lvl 15  mastermind going against level 800 streaming vtubers"
122490817,english,1,952070,"Update 2024 - Game is dead and full of cheaters. There is still a bit of a Playstation community but on Steam it is more or less completely unplayable. Don't buy...such a shame.  The core concept is great, 1v4 game where the 1 takes the role of the Mastermind - think of it as like a Dungeon Master or Zeus type role - where, through the CCTV cameras dotted around each facility, you lay traps and creatures in front of the survivors in a 3 stage/area experiment to see if they can survive. Each bit of damage you do to the survivors removes time from the clock and on the other side each kill the survivors get or objective completed adds time to the clock. Once they reach stage 3, the survivors have to destroy the bio-cores in order to escape the experiment.  There is a lot of customisation that you can apply to each character on both the mastermind and survivor side so you can almost rebuild a character to perform in a certain way - within their skill set. For the Mastermind, this is in the form of decks of creatures, traps, buffs, camera etc which you place within the level. You then enhance these with equipment so you can make your creatures faster, stronger or buff your economy so you can spawn lots of them for a few examples. You can specialise in certain creatures, you can specialise in cameras and traps, you can specialise in infecting the survivors etc you get the picture. You also have ultimate abilities that can be enhanced and special cards relative to each Mastermind. The same is for the survivors but they only get equipment and can change their special abilities. On top of this, there is tonnes of goofy cosmetics if that is your thing.  As of the date of this review, there is a small die-hard player base that are still playing. Most quite high levels but there are mid to low levels still in the game as well. This does cause issues with matchmaking...I don't believe there is any rank based matchmaking and there is quite a steep learning curve to the game. The tutorial is very very basic and shows you what the buttons are, to actually get good at the game requires map knowledge on both the survivor and mastermind side - which can only be gained by playing and losing quite a bit which I think puts most people off.   There is a bit of a problem with hacking/cheating. I mainly play Mastermind and every now and then you come across survivors who can auto-revive themselves, unlimited ammo, unlimited grenades that sort of thing. You can still beat them but when they quit, on the match summary screen at the end it shows that they won or ""escaped"" - despite the Mastermind actually winning. It doesn't affect your EXP or end match result or anything like that, it is just scummy. I haven't seen it from the Survivor perspective but I would imagine it is exactly the same.  I hope they switch it to a F2P model and give it a bit of TLC to encourage a larger player base back to it but honestly, I doubt that will happen.  Final word; I enjoy it, I think it is quite a unique concept and in the most part it is pretty well executed. The game is relatively balanced; you win some, you lose a lot sort of thing. I would only advise purchasing it on sale though."
76883149,english,0,952070,Incredibly play to win and the matchmaking is beyond bad. Lvl 50-100 survivors with everything unlocked against a lvl 5 mastermind and vice versa. Oh and the other side is always immensly toxic when winning and bullying lvl 5s. Truly i wonder why there are no more new players coming to play this game.
190516605,english,0,952070,"This game was so good. I am sad that it was not promoted at all and then quickly abandoned by Capcom. It is really a shame. If they had given some care to this game, I would have hundreds of hours on it.  The game was plagued by cheaters and lack of dedicated servers (leading to lag) and I still put in this many hours. I can't give it a recommendation because of what Capcom allowed to happen to it. RIP REsistance."
117540257,english,0,952070,"This game has much better potential than RE:Verse, but my god dude what is it with Capcom and making one off gamemodes for Resident Evil? Like now I can understand they want to make maybe online gamemodes but they are making shit nobody wanted, and then not supporting it when it backfires.  But this has actual potential that could possibly compete with shit like Dead By Daylight, IF given the proper management and care. But of course, Capcom did not do anything. It's mediocre at best, filled with hackers, no dedicated servers, not a shred of support to keep this game in a good manageable state.   For the love of God Capcom, if you wanted to make this, fucking make it and at least try to make it work and be enjoyable so it isn't such a forgotten mess. But yeah, this is will be dead forever."
123688204,english,0,952070,"This game is included for free when buying re3. (can't be removed from library) I've been ignoring it till now, since nothing I've heard about this game made me want to give it a try...  However since I'm going through games that I haven't played/played for very short time, I didn't want to make exceptions.  There's very few game modes ""quick match"" you get paired with randoms. Possibly due to the tiny player base there's massive imbalance. As a lvl 1 newbie you will constantly see lvl40, lvl100 or even lvl800 players.  Custom game. You can create either a public or private room.   Practice mode. You can either play as mastermind against 5 bot survivors, or as a survivor against 1 bot mastermind. (You don't level by playing on this mode, nor can you get achievements)  There's no campaign.   The premise itself isn't bad. As a mastermind you spawn/control zombies, place mines, you can even spawn and play as a tyrant!  As survivors you have to complete 3 maps, each map has 3 objectives (ex. find key items, destroy biocores) within a time limit and escape.  However there's no hiding the fact that It's executed rather badly... It's definately the worst resident evil game."

I've not had much playtime thus far, but thoughly enjoyed my time playing it :D  It follows similar formulas in its system from games like Paladins and Evolve. I've quite enjoyed the time I've put into this so far, and only wish that I had more time under my belt.  Its biggest drawback is that its still attached to RE3... please, CAPCOM, sell this as its own game! Its really great and I'd love more people to be able to play it!"

I guess you should've put the resources and time that went into this shit that nobody asked for and no one wanted into making the main game longer and better, Capcom.  Stop thinking that adding a half-assed generic multiplayer mode gives more value to single player games. It's not true. There is nothing wrong about a game being just a single player. Fuck this crap."
131551582,english,0,952070,"This game has been a mess since release, tightening up some things here and there with patches but ultimately a hard fail in terms of a multiplayer experience. At the time of this review, I am typing this while waiting on matchmaking (going on 5 minutes now) and throughout this critique I will share my thoughts on why this game should be avoided.  In all fairness, I will start with the positives. When matches work its a fun albeit kinda unbalanced game of survivors vs mastermind. Mastermind simply has to keep people in the experiment until the timer runs out, and survivors have to run objectives to get out alive. Respawning survivors deduct more time from the timer giving incentive to the mastermind to really lay into the survivor group and kill them as much as possible. Gameplay between the two sides is quite different, as the mastermind gets to really monitor the map as a whole with cameras and use abilities via a deck of equipment that is modifiable along with other gear that can influence certain attributes. Survivors get their own loadouts too and skills to bring their own touch to the group effort.   The really big problems? Loot boxes, progression systems, and rankings that are all out of balance make most match ups pretty one sided. Especially this late in the game's release with limited player base, expect matchmaking to be almost non-existent; putting you head to head with people who will have way more unlocked options and experience than you as they steamroll your efforts. The limited player base also makes it a shockingly long wait to get enough for a game. Capcom....why the fuck don't you ever explore the use of bots for your multiplayer games? Sure AI won't quite match a living, breathing player in most cases but in a game like this that hinges on having exactly 5 people then being able to fill empty spots is absolutely necessary when it reaches this point.  Full disclosure here, I did have to stop writing this as I finally got a match, which took me roughly another five minutes making it about a 10 minute wait for a match that lasted maybe a fraction of that. Not the worst game this series has to offer, and can't feel too wronged as I got it for free from getting RE3 (which was mostly good). Pass on this game, its another failed experiment from half-assed ideas given half-assed effort."
77902681,english,0,952070,"Fun idea, but messy execution.  -Game has been in a constant state of unbalance. First survivors were OP, then Masterminds with the Nicholai DLC, then back to Survivors again, where it stuck all the way thru.  -Game has a brutal learning curve: if you're just starting be prepared to lose, over and over again until you hit somewhere around level 20 on any of the survivors or masterminds  -No Anti-Cheat: I've played games where survivors would pull infinite molotovs, gun ammo, first aid sprays, and rocket launchers for longer than is possible in the game. I've seen survivors grab the area 1 keys through walls without leaving the safe zones.  -Community is, when looking at it optimistically, a mixed bag. There's some really awesome players but there's also a LOT of toxicity. More on that below.   -Active userbase is small .The Game's Last Update was the beginning of October, with no foreseeable updates in sight to fix the lack of proper balance. Most of the players have moved on and the few that remain are hardcore players with levels going as far as the 100-300 range. Because the pool is so small, you tend to wait in queue for a while, and you tend to get the same few people over and over again (which isn't fun if the connection is bad as a survivor, or if you're running against overpowered LVL 100+ SWAT teams as a mastermind)  -No dedicated servers, game is pvp with mastermind as host. Games can be ruined via bad connections and you're guaranteed to see a ""losing connection with mastermind"" type warning in every game you play. You a mastermind with bad internet? Prepare to be repeatedly harassed in dms and your profile about how you're a cheater and a lag switcher.  TL;DR - Game is unbalanced, has a small, quite hostile at times community, no servers, no anti-cheat, and no update to fix it all in sight. You'll have more fun playing RE 2 Remake or the RE 3 Remake Proper."

90452445,english,1,952070,"Well, I am reviewing as a newbie in multiplayer games and only as a survivor player in Resistance! I have never tried any multiplayer game, but since it was included with the RE3, I decided to give it a try. I started with the tutorial and then practice, in which I never managed to win in just five minutes. Tried with more time and I just saw how it goes. Didn't seem so exciting or even interesting. But since my first attempt playing in multiplayer mode, I got thrilled! It made a huge difference. Playing for now at least, only as a survivor, depending on how evil and experienced the Mastermind is, the game can be very challenging. Some really good Masterminds, make it even more evil and revengeful! It really gets into you, trying to escape, collaborate with the best way and help your fellow players. For me to say that a game is good and awesome, it must absorb, transfer my existence in to it and make me focus only on the mission/object. And Resistance definitely did that.   The fact that the online matches are relatably short, is an advantage, as you can experience gameplay in different areas, Mastermind difficulty and strategies, and fellow survivor characters. This game deserves more players!!! Com'on guys! I'm waiting for you to escape together!"
77405959,english,0,952070,"Had good potential, but it lacks balancing.  The game is unbalanced at low rank on both sides. As a survivor you don't have enough equipment/unlocks to fight high rank masterminds. As a low rank mastermind, you don't have enough equipment/unlocks to fight high rank survivors. Being required to play 40+ hours disadvantaged just to get on a level playing field will drive away all new players.  The game also fatally suffers from each match being hosted by the Mastermind, who benefits greatly from having a bad connection by making everyone else lag. If you get pitted against a russian Mastermind, might as well Alt+f4 cause it won't be playable.  More balancing and polish would be needed for this game to succeed, as it is, it's critically low on player count and steadily dying."

This was by far the most fun multiplayer Resident Evil experience I have EVER had! There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about playing this game! They broke this game for the benefit of a different multiplayer game they made instead: Resident Evil ReVerse. But Resident Evil ReVerse isn't Resident Evil Resistance; Resident Evil ReVerse SUCKS.

I mean, first you should check yourself and notice how stupid you sound: Resident Evil is, in its core, and how everyone has ever perceived to be, a SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCE...  But worry not, Capcom has attempted to make this absolute ""cashgrab"" of a game, and the vision is there whether you like it or not: there is a premise: every survivor has got a set of skills, they work together to prank the killer, who's got a better skillset, and escape the laboratory... Now, Dead by Daylight worked because Behaviour Interactive does its absolute best to keep the game balanced, and without hackers... Capcom? Hah, I know exactly what goes on in Capcom's head department: ""Well, let's add the Resident Evil name to it, and leave it for dead, people WILL play it, because they love Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, even with hackers"". That's funny because the game is an absolute GHOST TOWN right now.  I've been in queue for half an hour, and finally somebody joins and my entire pc slows down by like 170 frames per second... Being knowledgeable about how online games work, I immediatly told myself: ""How the F does Capcom allow Cheat Engine to run in an ONLINE game?"". Also, who came up with the idea of having the ""MasterMinds"", the supposed-to-be ANTAGONISTS in a RESIDENT EVIL game, to look like and be really just normal individuals... How am I supposed to believe that Annette was just working as a nurse all day long in a private clinic, then she got bored and started summoning zombies in the laboratory... Poor delusional Capcom lol they make lies, believe them and try to shove them down people's throats and it never goes well lol  Hopefully, the game can be 100%d even at this state, all you have to do is find a friend to do the achievements with, OR, if you've got 0 friends like me, grab your other second-hand laptop and log into your other Steam account and play with yourself till you get all the achievements haha. This is a [b]1/10[/b] miserable attempt at reaching Behaviour Interactive's level, but you know Capcom? Maybe you should stay in YOUR LANE... Be as woke as you want, but maybe don't try your hands at multiplayer games that are not FIGHTING games...

The concept isn't bad in theory but in pratice it's pretty horrible, the game feels cheap even with those amazing graphics.  The only thing this game does perfectly is showing us that a 4 player Co-op Resident Evil is possible but instead we get a PvP RE that nobody really asked.

66976387,english,0,952070,"[b] Pros: [/b] - Great gameplay, definitely it’s a boredom killer !!!   [b] Small minuses: [/b]  - Very few character builds, they need more skills active and passive to choose that’s for sure,  - Only 5 maps.  [b] Big Issues: [/b]  - A lot of cheaters  - There is no option to check your and your host ping so, when u start the game and you find out it’s like 500ms+ and it’s totally unplayable the only option is to just leave and get reward penalty or to just wait till game ends and lose a match? Are you kidding me? Give us an option to check ping and “leave” option in lobby if ping’s too high.  - As mastermind you have so many ""dead spots"" on cameras so u cant even hit survs...  - As surv you can shoot camera when standing behind the wall so mastermind cant even see you... rly?  [b] Already Fixed: [/b]  - Matchmaking,  - RP Booster.  So all in all I really do enjoy this game, but.. Game it's almost dead now ( 350 players )..."
87491117,english,1,952070,"This game is insanely fun.  It can be difficult to grasp at first but once you get the hang of how things works you'll have a great time. There's so much equipment and skill sets to unlock and experiment for both Survivors and Masterminds which allows for a huge array of costumization, making you wish to keep on trying different builds. The voice acting for the game is also what gives it charm, especially the Masterminds. Both voice actors and voice actresses did a phenomenal job. The soundtrack is also something to admire. Each map has it's own different background music to set up the mood for your surroundings and it even changes according to what's going on at the moment; for example, the music gets more intense whenever a Mastermind controls a zombie. As for the cosmetics, there's [b]a lot[/b] of them, ranging from sprays to weapon skins to even zombie skins (for Masterminds). You're bound to find something that you'll like amongst all of them. The downside is that the game's population isn't exactly big, however, it's still possible to find matches without waiting too long. All in all, Resident Evil: Resistance is worth playing if you're looking for some PvP coop action with other survivors or if you feel like becoming an evil mastermind, trying to stop the survivors from escaping."
77515052,english,1,952070,"UPDATE: Yo CAPCOM: =MAKE IT FREE TO PLAY= Please~ Otherwise, it'll be guaranteed to be inactive ~.~  This game came with RE3's remake. Overall, in my experience, is...eh, ok? It is randomly broken and not broken. Also way better played with friends.  My best look on this game that made it so fun was the make it as far as you can before the Time Limit is gone, or before you die. You can still get anb-S rank while still dying.  It is normal to have good and bad games at random in these types of games. Playing Solo as survivor can be boring SOMETIMES depending on your loadout, unless you are testing things.  Also, Info gathering loadouts/tactics from Streamers. Godtier C;  I do recommend giving this game a try~"

""Death does not take the old, but the ripe!""  Until I really understood the game, I still lose easily. Why? You might ask. Because the Masterminds might hack or use the download softwares.

127667414,english,1,952070,"I loved the idea and gameplay. Resistance wants (or wanted?) to be a great piece of amazing experiences for players with its joyful gameplay, physics and graphics, but fails to achieve this because of lack of support from Capcom...   I don't understand why Capcom decided to abandon a great idea, I'm sure it would've been of the best and most-played games of this genre if they had advertised it differently (maybe sold as a standalone game, free to play, etc) and decided to have dedicated servers and a proper anti-cheat system. They left this to dead, at some point they started to see this idea as an evil resident in their company, and unfortunately, Resistance cannot resist the fall of player base due to lack of faith from its creator.   Although I deeply wish (and pray) that Capcom reconsiders their decisions and starts working to get this amazing game up and running, for now, unfortunately I have to say that this game is not worth the price, but if I marked it as recommended, it's maybe on the hope that, as I said, Capcom rethinks its decisions."
66902871,english,0,952070,"[u]I cannot recommend this game in it's current state[/u].   [u]Bad things:[/u]  No dedicated servers make the game laggy. There are probably cheaters. XP boosters and lootboxes in an already expensive game does not make it better.  The game also makes for imbalanced matches due to the fact that there is no matchmaking, and the setup of the game mechanics also makes for heavily sided matches.   You most of the time know that you will get a godlike opponent and your team will most of the time suck.   Also the map design is really annoying and bad. (Latest patch bought at least one actually playable map without cramped corridors, still though 90% of maps are worthless design and the mini-map don't help a dime for finding your way in maps with more than one floor)  There are also extremely annoying animations for everything you do.  Lots of troll teammates.  Community is unfriendly.  [u]Good things:[/u]  At least it is pretty fun to play MM. And when you actually have a working game it can be fun to play survivor too."

98422277,english,0,952070,"This game used to be fun for me when it first came out to the point I didn't mind playing Solo Q but I mostly played with a full squad of survivors. But then I ran into a few games where the Masterminds were Hackers and there was just nothing to do but get killed relentlessly and watch the time just zoom down to 0 for a Game Over. Last time I played was when they added Nemesis in as a Mastermind which seemed completely broken as a Special Unit. He had a Rocket Launcher that I believed One Shotted most anyone. The final downside was this game didn't have enough of a community as you can only get this game if you buy Resident Evil 3. If this game was either Free with in Game purchases or a Small fee like $10/15 while still being Bundled with RE3 then it would of been great and could of had a lot more of a player base but would of needed the Devs to really take care of the game and get rid of the hackers and adjust the balance.   TL;DR: Game Had Great Potential BUT Hackers, Lack of a Sizable Community, and Unfair Balance Ruined It!"
69338052,english,1,952070,I know maybe others don't agree with me. But I really love this game. It brings me so much fun. I know quite many friends due to this game. Thank you Capcom. Thank you Resident Evil

86477459,english,1,952070,"I played this game for almost 200 hours on ps4. Now I finally have it on PC and I'm sad to see that the reception is bad. I played a little and I didn't find any cheaters so far. This game DOES need cross play (and anti cheat if it's not true) It's sad that you have to buy Resident Evil 3 to be able to play it even. It's everything you love that makes RE2 and 3 challenging. Except in the form of a coop game. The fact that the master mind is player controlled makes it so that every match is quite random. There are soooo many strategies that they can effectively use.  Do you like shooting zombies and using your wits to survive while solving objectives in dynamic modern survival horror combat and level traversal? Then this game is for you!!! There are many types of zombies, many builds you can make, many ways to play to survive and avoid being bit. Many ways to save your team and turn the tides to your favor doing awesome plays. Like for example when you get bit or die you lose time. The remaining match time determines whether you win or lose. If you do an objective or hurt/kill zombies you gain time. You can dodge through a bunch of zombies and use the right weapons to make room to move... Just to get to an objective across and then save the match that way. It's even better when your team has your back while doing it! There are many ways to play and many master mind tricks to look out for. I was just shot gunning one of the bio cores with a yellow herb, shooting dogs that were circling me at the same time while my team was panicking across the room in a crowd of zombies haha  All the resident evil challenges we love in the other survival horror RE games are here and it plays really great with all the deep mechanics!"
85537858,english,0,952070,The game is fun but support for it is basically dead and the only way it could be worth buying is if they didn't bundle it with RE3. I got it on sale for $20 but I would have easily payed $30 for what was a good time.
66909236,english,1,952070,"I think RE: Resistance could be a really good game given a fair opportunity, but you can blame Capcom (not Neobards) for ***** it up with poor distribution, lack of faith in supporting the game with dedicated servers, and not having anti-cheat. The game uses peer-to-peer connections so as the community declined, the matches became very unstable for the survivors. It also created a lot of toxicity in the community because the survivors naturally blame the host for the ""lag-switching"", even though it's just a bad connection that tends to get worse with the higher creature limit. Some people like to blame Neobards for not supporting the game which is not true, I have been playing since day one with 700+ hours, and the developers have pushed many good, and admittedly not so good balancing/content updates. To be fair, there are some balancing issues that make it very difficult for new players to pick up the game, specifically ""gun and mine decks"" that require a specific character with an optimized build.  Personally, I still enjoy the game because it has a very high skill ceiling, even after hundreds of hours I still learn new strategies for the mastermind and survivors to some extent. People don't give Resistance the credit for how complex it is, there are so many different ways to play each mastermind, not to mention that each map creates a different dynamic. The game is not very noob friendly, it takes at least 200 hours to be a worthwhile teammate, and it only takes one bad player to drag the entire team down. After the latest balancing patch, you would be lucky to win 30% of your survivor games in random which is certainly not a positive experience. Many players can't tell the difference between cheats and good players because the combination of certain cards can create some very abusive combination. When the Nicholai was introduced into the game, It felt like about half of the community rage quit because of uninteractive gun decks - they have been nerfed significantly, but you could still argue that gun decks are more effective overall.   Most importantly, Resistance can be a very fun game when you get those close matches with a good connection. I love the characters because they have so much personality, and I love the gameplay depth that it provides. There is just something really fun about being a ""bad guy"" and doing map presents, working out the best way to kill 4 people. For me it was the first asymmetrical multiplayer, I know there are other popular games that provide a better experience, but I guess I just have a misplaced sense of loyalty for this game, probably because it's based in Resident Evil lore. I honestly hope that we see characters like Daniel and January in other resident evil titles, I think they provide more flavor to what is otherwise is a very generic cast of characters if we being completely honest. Additionally, game has a deck-building aspect with many moving parts, adding a lot variety, experimenting and replay value.   [i] The cast of survivors makes the game feel like a cheesy horror movie, there is just something fun about roleplaying as stereotypes in a bad situation which reminds me of ""Friday the 13th"". [/i]  [h1] Pros: [/h1]  + I love the characters, both survivors and masterminds  + very high skill ceiling, good gameplay depth + ability to customize map presets and decks + many enjoyable character skins, even for zombies + fun roreplaying aspect  [h1] Cons: [/h1]  [u] Abusive Decks [/u] - there are certain decks that take advantage of characters that can't directly interact with you. Usually, those decks involve something to do with cameras or trap activation, like shield resets or just camera durability. You will find that sometimes your team just does not have the right tools for a fair fight, and even if you do, it could take a lot of perfect decisions. More recently, they introduced a toxic ""immunity"" mechanics which makes it unclear when to fight enemies.   [u] Distribution [/u] - It should be a free game with any RE purchase, it can't just be a RE3 tumor because it's a completely different game with a different audience. The smaller the community, the more likely you are to get a laggy match. It's peer to peer so it's not like they need money for hosting servers.   [u] Connection [/u] - due to the community decline, you will get matches with people in different regions, making the game borderline unplayable, or impossible on stage 3.  [b] Overall Thoughts: [/b]  As much as some people want to crap on Resistance I think those opinions are based on incomplete information or simply blaming the game for things that devs had little control over. To be fair the game is dead and there are many reasons for it, both in the game and outside of the game. Given a different mindset with distribution and content support, I think it could be a different story. I enjoyed it while it lasted, and I will play it from time to time with what remains of the community... Now I just hope that we can see some of the survivors in the new RE games - can you imagine Barry actually meeting Martin Sandwich...

105686635,english,1,952070,"Getting the RE 2 mod for this makes it 10x better! It's really fun to play with friends especially. I will say that this game does have an unbalanced system, for example, you can be a level 25 and go against a mastermind level 200. No one is ever too OP though. Often, you are playing against the same people and you learn to counter them as you keep going against them. It is a very fast paced game and it is fun to try and win at the last second!"

I don't recommend because it really isn't being maintained anymore and it also has a lot of really big problems."

116882201,english,1,952070,"This game is pretty fun as a concept, but as it's executed it just feels too one sided. Everything is stacked against the Mastermind if the Survivors have any understanding of what they're doing."

112255811,english,0,952070,"Look, I'm glad Capcom tried something new with Resistance, and to be honest, I do get a little enjoyment out of playing, but I cannot deny that the game is in an awful state, and there are a LOT of glaring issues with it.  Let's not beat around the bush and just get into it.  The matchmaking system is atrocious. It's so horrifically unbalanced to the point that if I had to chug an entire bottle of beer for every high-leveled player, both on the Survivor and Mastermind sides, I would've died of alcohol poisoning after what, 3 matches? It also takes forever to find a match sometimes, the queue times are so incredibly inconsistent. I nearly hit 20 minutes one time trying to find a 5th player. I wish I was kidding.  Playing as the Survivor usually goes a few different ways.  -Get carried through the entire match because the level 257 player can weave through the entire map unscathed, grab every single key item in a single blink, and have everybody make it out before you even get a chance to realize what just happened. -Get left behind CONSTANTLY because of basically ZERO communication between Survivors. Yeah, there are ""emotes"", but those can only do so much. There's no text/voice chat whatsoever, so you just have to pray that you can keep up with everybody else, because they sure as hell aren't gonna wait for you. -Usually end up running out of time because trying to rush as fast as possible to the exit while also watching out for traps doesn't exactly mix well. -Most likely get stuck in the first area because spamming everything you have as the Mastermind works surprisingly well, and fail because apparently, you’re supposed to push through Lickers that will down you in two hits, or worse, cameras that can shoot at you and can also down you incredibly quickly. Seriously, the Nikolai update RUINED this game. -Have at least one person disconnect at some point during the match, crippling your team and usually means you’re not making it to the end. -Or, and this is a favorite, have EVERYBODY ELSE disconnect, leaving you alone with the Mastermind as they spam everything they have behind the very first door.  Now playing as the Mastermind you would think would be the saving grace, right? What do you think?  -Watch as the matchmaking system makes your life hell as it pairs you up against an entire team of gold-wearing Survivors, all with triple-digit levels and able to take down everything you throw at them with ease. -Feel bad as you totally destroy a clearly new player being shoved in with people who have 3,000+ hours because as I mentioned, the matchmaking is atrocious. -Have the Survivors breeze through all of your traps and enemies because the Mastermind controls are so unintuitive and sluggish that by the time you have a room set up with clever traps and well-placed enemies, the Survivors have already left the Area. -Trying the spam “technique” that apparently works so well when you’re playing as a Survivor, but have it backfire on you so miserably that you might as well just leave the match and uninstall.  The lag is HORRENDOUS. It will literally take entire SECONDS after you’ve shot an enemy for the damage to pop up. Try to empty an entire magazine or absolutely beat the crap out of an enemy with a melee weapon? There's a very high chance that the game will just give you a middle finger and say you missed EVERYTHING. There's a few times where you'll walk down a hallway perfectly fine, and then all of a sudden get downed because apparently, you were getting shot at by a camera that entire time, because again, SCREW the Nikolai update. And on top of it all, you also have a high chance to miss every other turn because even though you clearly hit left, you’ll keep running forwards for a couple more seconds, and THEN finally have your input register as you turn right into an enemy that downs you, and get left alone as apparently all the other Survivors are already at the Exit while you just barely made it to where the first key was supposed to be. I think the biggest reason why the lag is so awful is because Capcom made the baffling decision to use P2P connections. Are dedicated servers really just so unfathomable to developers?  Lootcrates, anyone? Because in order to get ANY upgrades or cosmetics for your characters, you have to go through them. And of course, playing matches will only get you a certain amount of points to buy said crates, even LESS if you fail. The only way to max out how many? You basically have to do a flawless run. EVERY TIME. Yeah, you can use RP Boosters to increase the amount of points you get, but they only last for so long. But hey, you can always buy more. WITH REAL MONEY.  There are an embarrassing amount of glitches too, like trying to pick a Survivor just... not working as you're stuck on the menu until someone inevitably leaves. Or have your mouse randomly stop working, forcing you to plug in a controller just to continue playing. And my favorite, going to pick up an item on the last Area of a match, only for the game to freak the f**k out and literally teleport you outside the map, making you unable to move and be forced to watch as every other Survivor leaves without you.  What sucks the most is that I can totally see the potential of this game, I do enjoy the game when it works and doesn't lag out to all hell, the characters are unique and interesting, the gameplay, while flawed, could totally work, and the general idea is rock-solid and with some more love and dedication, I think this could be a fantastic game if Capcom actually put forward the effort to fix it and make it better... but sadly, something tells me that Capcom won't do that anytime soon. Or ever.  And again, SCREW the Nikolai update."
77051175,english,0,952070,"I like the escape room concept but there are so many flaws in this game.  FLAWS Timer is way too short. Never enough time. It's like you're expected to know exactly where all the key items are and if you have all the supplies needed like lots of ammo and melee.  I understand that all Resident Evil games, EXCEPT 4 and later, have very small pouches (girls have purses boys have fanny packs) so they can only carry 8 items. Definitely not enough space. 16 or more spaces would be perfect.  Random people are mostly players who want to have fun while this game is so difficult that requires pure skill.  Best to play when you have a team, clan, or guild or close friends who play this with you so you can practice, discuss, or even use voice chat.  It is true what they say about the mastermind or I like to call it (security guard, lol. Get it? Their main work purpose is monitoring and alerting) They are too overpowered and 8 out of 10, they win.  It took me awhile to find key items, there should be a arrow above the characters head that points a direction where you need to go like a compass instead of checking the map, when you browse the map, the mastermind takes this wonderful opportunity to kill you because you are ""afk"".  DESTROYING THE WATER TANKS TAKE FOREVER, A LOT OF TIME CONSUMED. Expect 3 to 10 minutes. And you need to break 4 of them total.  If all the things I posted were updated in favor of the survivors and I mean a huge buff to survivors and a huge NERF to mastermind then you would get more positive reviews.  CONCLUSION This game is only playable singleplayer on free mode, plenty of time, money, and supplies. You gotta be lucky or very popular to play this with people you know and people you practice with.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! WASTE OF CPU MEMORY!"
90692945,english,1,952070,"RE:Resistance is an arcade style randomly generated 1v4 horror game. Firstly, this game is done. There is no more development being worked on, whatever we have is what we have - and we have a lot for what we've gotten. The game can be a bit difficult to get into because you have to get equipment to add to your characters / mastermind or survivor / as MM this means you might be getting your shit kicked in for a bit till you can afford some high level equipment, and as survivor - you can get by without full equipment; but if the MM Is tricked out you might feel overwhelmed by the zombies. This can often give players the perception that the MM Is ""hacking"" when infact its just that they have alot of equipment / levels over you. But, because the game has such a low population - it's difficult for it to match players that are at close levels, so this might happen occasionally, but with the recent sale i've been getting more players in the lower levels of things. I play this game entirely solo as i dont have any friends who are masochistic enough to play this with me all night, but despite this - I still manage to have lots of  fun when im not lagging out because of the MM's connection, or we're being hacked to death. and most if not all the time it's the former. But in the small moments where everything is working as intended :tm: the game absolutely shines. The characters are fully voiced beautifully, the director of the VAs was ON it. They interact with each other and the environment, their voicelines are so clear and crisp and are VERY reactive. it's very immersive. The atmosphere is incredible, and you'll often find yourself stopping to soak in the air while your team is getting mauled to death by and E.I.S zombie. The MM's are very wellwritten - each having unique traits and playstyles that shows in every aspect of the personality. Ontop of that, we also get to design custom loadouts for every character, MM or survivor. This includes changing how your passive / active / ultimate works, and of course those equipments that can increase your durability/damage/health and even decrease negative effects. We also have VERY unique cosmetics for every character/weapon we even have dances you can unlock that you can perform as a zombie when playing MM or as a survivor - and the meme level of those is high af  To be honest, capcom shit the bed with this one - the game had alot of potential, but now it lives in a small cave, being worshipped by a cult following. If you're buying RE3 JUST to play this, please wait for a sale - you will feel so much better about the price tag when you are dealing with laggy connections, and when youre getting shat on by mechanics while learning.  Like, there IS a learning curve - and it is kind of hightened because you wont be playing with complete shitter masterminds always, or complete shitter survivors. But understand that once you get the equipment you need the load starts to become alot more manageable and you'll find yourself having more fun than you were before  PS:  only buy high tier equipment  PPS: also barging into doors is a negative frame please just let your tyrone kick it in or let jill lockpick it - if you have to barge in have someone train a gun on the door behind you"

The mechanics and graphics are better than ever for the franchise, although there are stressful moments like zombies chain-grabbing you in a small area or several dogs and lickers jumping at you non-stop... But as a fan, I do enjoy it.  Playing as Mastermind is quite amusing as well... There's something evil about cornering survivors with waves of buffed creatures, locking doors behind them and laying traps on the stairs and watching them fall for them. There's something thrilling about playing Spencer and saying ""I'm doing this for humanity... Humanity needs me as a God. Don't you agree?""  However, there are serious issues with this game, the biggest being the absence of dedicated servers and anti-cheat system, as well as how unbalanced it feels in the beginning. By playing it, I did get frustrated a lot coming across Masterminds (which are the villains, and ironically, the hosts of the matches) who either cheat or have terrible network connections, making the match lag so hard that I have seen zombie dogs fly. In the beginning, you might want to quit this game for good because it is so unfair for players without any experience since you will have a hard time trying to go up against death squads (if you play as the MM) or well-prepared villains (if you play as the survivors), all levelled up at high ranks and full of stuff at their disposal while you have nothing (nearly nothing).  Apart from that, the game is really cool, and I love the costumes available in-game for free as well. Such a shame many people don't recognise the potential of this entry and it pains me to see such an amazing game die so quickly."
67794752,english,1,952070,"In short, the game is good and have a lot of potential, but if the problems remains unresolved then the game will be dead quickly.

If q times in 2020 were eternal, you can imagine how it is now, mostly cheaters or high mms masterminds.  This game was so fresh and brand new, the perfect Resident Evil themed multiplayer, lots of grind and almost the perfect competition to dbd... But if Capcom doesn't give updates, dedicated servers or anticheats, less people will care. If you call a peak of 60 players per month playing Re Resistance a playerbase, then this game is well dead, thank you Capcom for not even trying to keep up, the same thing will happen to Re:verse.

Stop releasing multiplayer games with a live-service model only to stop updating them after 6 months. Commit and have faith in your product.

It took a ton of blame for RE3R's sub-optimal launch and review-bombing, and for its overpriced cost (triple-A pricing despite CAPCOM's marketing team recommending against it). Its restricted availability and scapegoated existence make it look unappealing. These games are [i]fine[/i] on their own – they don't need to be attached together. RE: Resistance didn't even have an RE3R content until several months later – so why were these game packaged together?  I mean... [b][i]Damn[/i][/b], I really love a [b]fun[/b] asymmetrical game. This is such a fun game. The core game idea is great, it meshes well with the franchise it uses (without needing to rely solely on the license either!), and it had ample room to grow both its preexisting mechanics and potential for new ideas. Public matchmaking is terrible, but if you have 2-4 friends it's pretty fun despite the balancing. I'd love for CAPCOM to release an asymmetrical RE game that they're actually confident in, gave the proper time and resources to, and plan to maintain longer than 6 months."

Pros - Good concept, game play is fun. Cons - No official servers, means peer to peer connection, meaning horrible lag in almost every game, and game can end if host is losing and decides to leave the match. Almost no players on PC.

188136894,english,0,952070,"Resistance is a 4v1 multiplayer game set in the Resident Evil universe where players need to work together as they try to escape different scenarios, all the while the Mastermind player attempts to stop them by deploying traps and enemies. In theory this game certainly had potential, however in execution there is a lot left to be desired. Issues with balancing are blatant, with some characters and masterminds being a lot more useful than others, often creating unevenness in matches. The game itself is very repetitive, as the objectives don't vary all that much. Matchmaking is generally atrocious. The player base never really caught on so finding a match can take ages and often when you do, there are loads of cheaters that suck whatever enjoyment remains. Capcom seems to have pretty much abandoned support for it at this point. Give this title a miss, even if you're a big fan of the RE series."

Many MMs are laggy. I don't know whether it is because the area is too far away, the server is faulty, or the MM got internet problem. XD Anyway I like this game very much as a biohazard fan but I don't recommend to play it. : (  2023.04.17 added: This game is literally broken by bots, you cannot find matches as MM in random. If you are a veteran and planning for a return, I suggest you to go for custom. There are some static people playing custom games every day but it's kinda hard to level up due to the point you earn from custom is really low. Rookie? I suggest you go find something else to play.  如果是国人的话，野排已经死了。建议加我好友拉你进开黑群，人够了一般会发车玩自定义，也能体验这个游戏，不过自定义给的经验很少，很难升级，对新人很不友好。"

This title was supposed to be sold separately, but It was sold together with the third version. Unfortunately, it is not of good quality and has nothing to do with your experience. The game servers are empty and you have to wait a long time to go to the competition and experience it. And very soon this title will disappoint you. May be.  دوستان بذارید اینطور شروع کنم،ناامید کننده بخش چند نفره بازسازی نسخه سوم،اصلا جالب نیست و پرداخت های درون برنامه ای بسیاری دارد،که شما رو مجبور به خرید و ارتقا سریع تر و دسترسی به تجهیزات برای مبارزه و پیشروی میکند.این عنوان قرار بود به صورت جداگانه به فروش برسد ولی با نسخه سوم یکجا فروخته شد متاسفانه کیفیت خوبی ندارد و چیزی ندارد که شما رو به تجربه آن مشغول کند.سرور های بازی خالی هستند و مجبورید انتظار های طولانی بکشید برای رفتن به رقابت و تجربه آن.و خیلی زود این عنوان برای شما ناامید کننده میشود."

Play both survivors and Mastermind, the latter is especially unique and there is no other game that has this game mechanic. I ignored reviews and tried this game out, it has hooked me, I play it alot its a fun game once you get the hang of it. The hardest part is the beginning because many people are experienced and skill difference is high between new players and veterans, but once you get to know the basics its really fun. The only downside is the absence of dedicated servers, p2p connection makes games for survivors often laggy, because of the small playerbase its likely that Mastermind(who is host) is far away in the world. The playerbase is small but is very active, so you always find matches between 1-5 minutes usually, if you select Random in Quick Match. The only blame should not be given to this game but Capcom who did not give this game the treatment it deserved, this game has a lot of wasted potential."
191466572,english,1,952070,"5/10 - I don't know even who is the audience for this game, but unexpectadly I enjoyed it!  Received this game as a bonus for Resident Evil 3 remake pre-order, never cared about it and never planned to play it, but since then I start grinding for achivs. Heard that the games servers will be shut down in summer, so I assumed it's time to play it now or never.  Visually it's what you saw in RE2RE and RE3RE - a good looking game. Yet level design is a luckluster, I don't know how difficult it is to make balanced and yet captivated locations so I might be wrong in this, but they definitely could make it better and more memorable. Not even a single stage impressed me, yet almost all of them have some parts of the stage that I really like.  Music and sounds, overall pretty good, more or less memorable music, well delivered lines by masterminds and survivors, good-decent sounds on everything else.  Gameplay - four survivors vs mastermind, while survivors try to make an objective and escape from stage, mastermind tries to stop them with everything they got. Doesn't sound all to great on paper, but actually might be a lot of fun. Why ""might"" be you ask? First of all P2P connection, you might be from UK while you opponent will be from japan, but sometimes it will feel like he is from Saturn. Because its P2P you will find yourself playing against some ""pluggers"", you got fine/tolerable connection in stage 1 and terrible at stage 3, up to forced disconnect. And of course we got cheaters, there is not that much of them (because there is not that much players) but they are here. There is some veterans in the game, not to mention they know the game in and out unlike you, they also got all abilities and perks/equipment unlocked which puts you into serious disadvantage. The last one is balance, I didn't play this game as long as others, but it feels survivors are in favour, 4 survivor veterans will pulvaryze veteran mastermind, IF one of them will be unlucky, ""how is that?"" the thing is when you choose your survivor/mastermind you don't know who you will play against and won't make a hard counterpick.Although I said I enjoyed it, It wasn't very intresting to play as survivor, yet playing as mastermind was quite enjoyable for me.  I hope RESISTANCE 2 will come out someday (it probably won't), because I do see a potential in the game, but you need to put more effort and faith in this project Capcom ."
85457326,english,0,952070,"If you are a newby DON'T play in this game. Matchmaking is an absolute joke. For example you start as Mastermind Rank 1 and the game puts survivors Rank 100 against you. Or as Survivor Rank 1 you get to fight Mastermind Rank 100. And there are literally only 100 people playing this game daily. I suppose the game had bigger online in spring 2020, but now it's dead. The sad thing is that I think the RE:SISTANCE is pretty fun. The gameplay is interesting and it's fun to play this kind of game  in the RE Universe. But I really can’t feel good about it right now. So take my advice, if you just bought Resident Evil 3, don't bother yourself even downloading RE:SISTANCE. Save your time and disc space on your PC."
139326727,english,0,952070,"[h1] Review[/h1]  Since RE3 was such a short game for a semi-full price game adding some sort of Multiplayer is definitely not a bad idea if the multiplayer is actually fun an interesting. RE5 and 6 had a much longer game and shipped or later on added various multiplayer coop or vs modes. This one goes the hardest route I can imagine: asymmetrical gameplay in a pvp environment.  [u]Gameplay[/u] Here is the kicker. I cannot really describe the gameplay because you cannot play the game anymore. Not only is the player base low but also, aside private matches, public matchmaking is not possible. Its necessary for unlocking cosmetics or abilities and permanent modifications.   Matchmaking is not possible as the player who is the Mastermind will most of the time get a glitched lobby. I´ve been told that the reason for that is the hacks of someone. Bots will directly try to join a Masterminds lobby and immediately leave and rejoin or some weird stuff like that. So, in 2 hours of searching, I managed to find (my) premade group as the mastermind twice.  The core gameplay is as far as I can see not actually that bad. You have four survivor with various abilities and playstyles and a mastermind who tries to kill or damage the player and thus lowering the time they have to escape. The game has three stages, first a key/puzzle piece hunt, then a keycard hunt where the person who has the keycard has to interact with various terminals and at last you have to destroy three power cores to escape. A game usually takes around 10-20 minutes.  The mastermind places traps and monsters depending on a complex card and resource system. He also has to use cameras whom can be shot. I cannot say really how balanced it is but I doubt it is balanced in any way aside playing it very casually. If people remember the camera positions or pick characters that are op (I heard certain survivors make certain masterminds obsolete, characters like Jill or Becca are very often picked. Mastermind Nikolai also seems hated as he solely works by spamming traps and trying to shoot down a survivor with a camera gun when he cannot move.  [u]Story[/u] None, just random villains and aside Jill who got added later on there are survivors created just for this game.   [u]Sound[/u] From an absolute banger of a main menu theme towards more environmental songs that step up in certain situations this game got it all. Really great ost that doesn’t have to hide from the rest of the franchise. Even got voice acting in a couple of languages too!  [u]Graphics[/u] While it does take the same style and graphics of RE2/3 there is a downgrade. It does have a few interesting animations, especially in melee combat with various zombie finisher, it does have a worse quality. Probably got downgraded due to the online portion.  [u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u] All in all playing a few rounds with friends was really fun. There are a lot of problems with this mode, being unplayable at the moment wasn’t its final nail in the coffin. Bad balancing for a game system like that it had a lack of support from the developer and I also heard, aside the currently hacked lobbies, that people back then managed to solely hack the game with cheat engine. Yeah no wonder it died directly.  Broken and dead multiplayer game"
67754177,english,0,952070,"As a matter of fact, I had to force myself to meditate and calm down before exploding in anger in the course of writing this review. why did I bother to write this review? maybe I wanted to complain about what made me feel uncomfortable; thus I could feel better.  The game is set in the in vivo experiment base with human beings by Umbrellas. The game rules are simple: the experimenter tries to stop survivors from escaping, and the survivors try to escape with using their resources.  The characters have their own skills and have to crate well-organized strategies so that they will escape from the grasp of the villain experimenter. The game plays under this big framework.  At a glance, it may feel like a survival game, like Dead by Daylight, but it deserves praise for its differentiating elements, including high quality graphic and character design.  There is nothing more to be desired in the game as long as the overall package is concerned. ""survivors work together to create a strategy and fight against experimenter with their own strategies."" A wonderful development of story is anticipated like a beautiful painting. A closer look at its various aspects, however, will reveal that the game is full of problems to which any game enthusiasts would shake their heads.  If only those who love Resident Evil play this game, the small-sized users will not matter. When cheating is prevalent among users, however, things are different. The number of users are already small for this game, but players who cheat extort common users and smile an evil smile behind of a screen. just thinking of this possibility can make disappoint who have been excited to play the game.  If you come across players whose IDs Start with ***, seven in ten cases will turn out to be cheaters. If they are experimenters, you will face endless bombardment by machine guns with numerous zombies around.  The next problem I would lie to point out concerns the network. when the host network is unstable, the players on the surviving side will experience such inconvenience that their game environment becomes uncomfortable. This game only has a small of users. If its host network is unstable you will experience more than simple game play; you will find yourself sitting helpless while vacantly looking at the bloody red monitor after getting beaten by the host experimenter while not being able to do anything.  When you come across cheaters, who usually play on the experimenter side and have IDs starting with ***, there is a big possibility that they are Chinese. Even if there is no cheating, users on the experimenter side are asked o practice a high level of control. Since cheaters can pour out the abilities of an experimenter with no limits, they must prefer the experimenter role for convenience.  I came across a Chinese player that overused cheats and was subjected to no restrictions. I can imagine them deceiving and mocking other honest users and smiling wickedly behind their anonymous ID starting with *** while continuing to cheat right at that moment. You will get a bonus, too, which is their mockery of the manager's inability and celebration of great China.  I feel bad thinking of some players around the world getting tormented by cheaters on resident Evil. My biggest concern is that there is nothing to console the users that were tormented by cheaters and left the game as no media or means of communications has criticized these cheating players.  Can we expect a game culture of respecting and treating those who do play fair with no tricks and deception in this game? If you come across an experimenter and feel suspicious you'd better log out of game and pray that you will not get a match with this Chinese player next time."
156994774,english,0,952070,"This game has potential, but like what other reviews have said, without dedicated server, Mastermind is always the host, thus they can lag switch so survivors can't do anything but to lose.   If you are new, winning as Mastermind is impossible without equipment, and you get matched with high level survivors with equipment who have been playing for years.  There are only handful of active players, after playing for a few hours, you can remember their names and know who is the lag switchers, and who is the toxic teammate blocking objective with items or not getting into gate for next area. Some are online every day because they lag switch to make sure they win when they start losing, there is no point playing against them.  And also, low player count means half your time is playing queue simulator.  In summary, it might be fun for the first few games, but don't even download this, it will waste your time."

82639255,english,1,952070,"Resident Evil Resistance is to say the least, a beautiful monstrosity. In nearly every way possible, this game was strangled, chained for death, and left abandoned, yet there are still many who hold on because there is still so much potential in this game. Despite the plentiful issues, player base toxicity, lag, hacking, questionable design choices, OP Survivor/ Mastermind builds, over-reliance of RNG in mechanics, and lack of teamwork (On and on), there is still so much enjoyment to be had in this game; But alas, that one good game every so often that makes all the absolutely terrible rounds in between worthwhile, is becoming rarer and rarer.  Everyone has known since day one that it should have been sold separately. That one caveat to getting this game immensely hindered its growth. Even without Dedicated Servers, at least there would have been a steady starting player base and coupled with a lesser price for entry, and months of updates, laggy games would have been less frequent, as there would have possibly been more local people to play with which would aid overall enjoyment. As the player base dwindles the games have to reach further and further for players which exacerbates the games lag, as well as it's many flaws. It's truly a vicious cycle. This issue was made even more troublesome when the updates stopped coming and everyone dropped ship, due to heartbreak and the ever worsening state of the game.  Also, I gotta say, this game's store page is absolutely abysmal, the lone 5 pre-released pictures and the all red Recent/All Review Ratings expedited, and was a product of, its ever-increasing irrelevance and popular decline which is sad to see. From the get-go this game is niche, survival horror and especially an Outbreak/Mercenaries style game was a risk, but despite all that, they somehow made a compelling and fun experience. The game's identity problem, lack of direction and faith in the work really shows with how its left in its currently state. If a stranger somehow stumbled on this games store page without any prior knowledge, I highly doubt they would think under all that mediocrity that there is actually a great game laying neglected underneath.  Resistance has made me feel many strong emotions. May they be of pure anger and frustration from constant terrible solo-que matches, bliss and euphoria from a difficult but ever rewarding close game, or simply joy from the little things that make each game played unique and fun. Resistance is amazing, it's my ugly duckling and I love it to pieces. But those that feel similarly know of the deep sadness and just disappointment seeing the game withering away every week to only disappear into obscurity.  Despite the many flaws justly criticized by the player base, I do truly recommend this game because I know there are others out there like me, while knowing and experiencing its shortcomings, that will still find joy and a fulfilling challenge. It's just very unfortunate that this game is left as it is, it could have been so very fruitful if it was given a chance. No wonder why the player base is so morose, divided and spent."

82788997,english,1,952070,I haven't played much on this steam profile but honestly can see myself playing for a couple hundred hours! Similar to DBD but with more challenge and less repetitive as well you have to play more team-based to win rather than having a sole survivor.   It isn't at all pay to win and has rarely any hackers and honestly you can find a match quicker than DBD.
67205347,english,1,952070,"[h1][b]Introduction[/b][/h1] «Resident Evil: Resistance» is an asymmetrical-multiplayer set in the world of Resident Evil. It has developed by «Capcom» in association with «NeoBards Entertainment».  The game has been announcement on «Tokyo Game Show» 2019 and meet negative feedback. As expected, some people was dissatisfied the fact that «Capcom» create project like this instead of «Resident Evil: Outbreak: File 3» or just remake of «Resident Evil: Outbreak». As answer on this situation «Capcom» with announce of «Resident Evil 3» declared that «Resident Evil: Resistance» will be a part of the game.  Also, «Resident Evil: Resistance» has an open-beta in a period from 23rd of March until 3rd of April. [h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1] As dictated by this genre, concept of this game is a resistance of one person with survivors (1 vs. 4). This game divided on two different modes: survivor and mastermind, which one is differ each other a lot.  There are two different objectives of these modes. The survivors have to escape before time runs out, while mastermind ought to prevent them from escaping.  There are six different survivors which have unique skills that they have to use to cover each other and defeat creatures together.  Also, there are four different masterminds, which one of them have unique creatures and special weapon helps them to prevent survivors escape. [h1][b]Visuals[/b][/h1]  This game uses «RE Engine». Regardless of low system requirements, graphics looks great, there are a lot of different options and cinematic effects. As for a cursory glance the game looks more clearly than RE3. Also, optimization of the game is good just like other games on that engine.  The design of the maps looks awesome. Incredible attention to the details. [h1][b]Sound[/b][/h1] Suddenly, the composer of the game is Jeff Broadbent. Everything sounds great like it should be. Especially strands out the main theme.  Also there are a few mixes of tracks from the previous games, and they sounds great in environment of the game. [h1][b]The verdict[/b][/h1]  «Resident Evil: Resistance» is a great example of modern today online games, without any objective but extremely fun. It has great potential. It’s has everything it needs to the popular online game. There are a lot of great choices in the balance of the game, but it's not enough. There is room for improvement. It needs long support.  An indicated list of the issues to be resolved, in my humble opinion: 1) Dedicated servers; 2) Matchmaking improvements; 3) Balance improving, refinement; 4) Some sort of anti-cheat; 5) Cross-platform play."
140614279,english,0,952070,not good bad awfully bad i dont even see a point to say why it's bad burn this game with umbrella corps and resident evil survivor cds
120425824,english,0,952070,"saw this on my list and it reminded me i will never forgive capcom for shooting this game dead lol  my favourite horror asym game but i cannot in good consciousness recommend it because of how terribly it was handled. this thing had no chance. it was marketed so poorly that it was judged on the basis of it ""taking time/budget away from re3r"" and hated for that reason despite it having nothing to do with that game, just arbitrarily bundled with it. you cant buy this thing separately and to this day this steam page is still hidden (??????). horribly unbalanced in all manner of ways and incredibly unintuitive for new players. they failed to patch a lot of its problems out in a timely manner and as a result bled the majority of players in a matter of weeks. and then killed only after half a year before it could be developed any further :(  maybe capcom will learn with RE:verse oof"
68423065,english,0,952070,"TL;DR: The game is has soooo much potential, but is mired by massive balance issues (both for new players and for high level ones), terrible connectivity due to P2P networking, progression scaling that is very punishing to new players, zero intelligent, skill-based matchmaking, and an absurd amount of hackers.  So, first of all let me say I do actually *really* like this game. There's some serious potential in this game, and there's so many mechanics in place that a variety of playstyles can definitely be an option.  Now that that's out of the way, here's why you shouldn't play it, *yet*. The level scaling is ROUGH, for starters. You don't really feel like you're making any impact at all until you get a character to around level 7-10, which is about 4 hours of gameplay. It also matches you with max-ranked players incredibly frequently, regardless of whether or not you're playing mastermind or survivor; because the gear and skills scale so hard up to level 25, you will constantly be getting wrecked. An example is playing an L3 Annette (the first mastermind you can play) with only +8% to creature damage, while a L25 Becca is using a build that gives her literally +230% damage (we've done the math), and can kill your toughest creature in 0.5s.  The inverse is also true, Sam is a pretty broken character right now after level 11, but before that a max rank Daniel mastermind controlling a zombie can *literally* 2-shot you (he has a build that can 1-shot all but 2 characters).  The game is time based, so all gameplay is rush-rush-rush; new players are often left in the dust by their team just trying to figure out where they need to go, and smart masterminds punish that mistake *heavily*, causing you to throw the match by simply not knowing the map.  On top of that, the game is extremely unbalanced in favor of the survivors. Any sub-optimal mastermind build does little more than feed time to half-competent survivors because of poor balance, many builds use multiplicative modifiers to break mechanics (such as Valerie's Remedy Mixtape build that cuts her healing ult down from 150s to 87s, constantly clearing infection that takes over 100s to become effective, Becca's Bullet Storm Ult that will let her kill everything in sight, etc).  That takes me to my final balance gripe. The character Becca has an ult that allows her to have infinite ammo for 10s. This is all fine and balanced until you factor in that this also works on special weapons like the grenade launcher and rocket launcher that are literally balanced on ammo count; once you run out of ammo, the gun is destroyed. Becca can deal 32,000 AoE damage from any range every 87 seconds; the highest health monster has 2650 HP, and the three biocores at the final stage of each map has 16,000 HP. And yes, on 2 of the 4 maps currently in the game you can absolutely shoot two of the 3 biocores from a single location, killing both within 10 seconds.  Oh, and there's hackers. Lots of hackers, literally zero anti-cheat (you can't even kick players in-game for being afk, let alone report them for hacking)."
191593109,english,1,952070,"Well , I have to admit that this is the best game out there, all i can say is thank you CAPCOM for this game, (cause when i decided to buy some games This was in a bundle only.) and thank you to all the players that played and play with me. and for the cheaters , well i hope the next game doesn't have these flaws"
170364060,english,0,952070,"The game was abandoned 6 months after its initial release. Another heap of garbage bundled with a good game just like Reverse and Village  Stay away from this game like the plague. Either you will wait endlessly looking for a match or when you do, whoever runs the Master Mind will be running the game with full cheats rendering the whole thing unplayable. You have been warned......"
123311446,english,0,952070,"Playing mastermind surprisingly impossible, Cameras constantly shot, people rushing to objectives, its a dead game that people grind survivor on, im a lvl 15  mastermind going against level 800 streaming vtubers"
122490817,english,1,952070,"Update 2024 - Game is dead and full of cheaters. There is still a bit of a Playstation community but on Steam it is more or less completely unplayable. Don't buy...such a shame.  The core concept is great, 1v4 game where the 1 takes the role of the Mastermind - think of it as like a Dungeon Master or Zeus type role - where, through the CCTV cameras dotted around each facility, you lay traps and creatures in front of the survivors in a 3 stage/area experiment to see if they can survive. Each bit of damage you do to the survivors removes time from the clock and on the other side each kill the survivors get or objective completed adds time to the clock. Once they reach stage 3, the survivors have to destroy the bio-cores in order to escape the experiment.  There is a lot of customisation that you can apply to each character on both the mastermind and survivor side so you can almost rebuild a character to perform in a certain way - within their skill set. For the Mastermind, this is in the form of decks of creatures, traps, buffs, camera etc which you place within the level. You then enhance these with equipment so you can make your creatures faster, stronger or buff your economy so you can spawn lots of them for a few examples. You can specialise in certain creatures, you can specialise in cameras and traps, you can specialise in infecting the survivors etc you get the picture. You also have ultimate abilities that can be enhanced and special cards relative to each Mastermind. The same is for the survivors but they only get equipment and can change their special abilities. On top of this, there is tonnes of goofy cosmetics if that is your thing.  As of the date of this review, there is a small die-hard player base that are still playing. Most quite high levels but there are mid to low levels still in the game as well. This does cause issues with matchmaking...I don't believe there is any rank based matchmaking and there is quite a steep learning curve to the game. The tutorial is very very basic and shows you what the buttons are, to actually get good at the game requires map knowledge on both the survivor and mastermind side - which can only be gained by playing and losing quite a bit which I think puts most people off.   There is a bit of a problem with hacking/cheating. I mainly play Mastermind and every now and then you come across survivors who can auto-revive themselves, unlimited ammo, unlimited grenades that sort of thing. You can still beat them but when they quit, on the match summary screen at the end it shows that they won or ""escaped"" - despite the Mastermind actually winning. It doesn't affect your EXP or end match result or anything like that, it is just scummy. I haven't seen it from the Survivor perspective but I would imagine it is exactly the same.  I hope they switch it to a F2P model and give it a bit of TLC to encourage a larger player base back to it but honestly, I doubt that will happen.  Final word; I enjoy it, I think it is quite a unique concept and in the most part it is pretty well executed. The game is relatively balanced; you win some, you lose a lot sort of thing. I would only advise purchasing it on sale though."
76883149,english,0,952070,Incredibly play to win and the matchmaking is beyond bad. Lvl 50-100 survivors with everything unlocked against a lvl 5 mastermind and vice versa. Oh and the other side is always immensly toxic when winning and bullying lvl 5s. Truly i wonder why there are no more new players coming to play this game.
190516605,english,0,952070,"This game was so good. I am sad that it was not promoted at all and then quickly abandoned by Capcom. It is really a shame. If they had given some care to this game, I would have hundreds of hours on it.  The game was plagued by cheaters and lack of dedicated servers (leading to lag) and I still put in this many hours. I can't give it a recommendation because of what Capcom allowed to happen to it. RIP REsistance."
117540257,english,0,952070,"This game has much better potential than RE:Verse, but my god dude what is it with Capcom and making one off gamemodes for Resident Evil? Like now I can understand they want to make maybe online gamemodes but they are making shit nobody wanted, and then not supporting it when it backfires.  But this has actual potential that could possibly compete with shit like Dead By Daylight, IF given the proper management and care. But of course, Capcom did not do anything. It's mediocre at best, filled with hackers, no dedicated servers, not a shred of support to keep this game in a good manageable state.   For the love of God Capcom, if you wanted to make this, fucking make it and at least try to make it work and be enjoyable so it isn't such a forgotten mess. But yeah, this is will be dead forever."
123688204,english,0,952070,"This game is included for free when buying re3. (can't be removed from library) I've been ignoring it till now, since nothing I've heard about this game made me want to give it a try...  However since I'm going through games that I haven't played/played for very short time, I didn't want to make exceptions.  There's very few game modes ""quick match"" you get paired with randoms. Possibly due to the tiny player base there's massive imbalance. As a lvl 1 newbie you will constantly see lvl40, lvl100 or even lvl800 players.  Custom game. You can create either a public or private room.   Practice mode. You can either play as mastermind against 5 bot survivors, or as a survivor against 1 bot mastermind. (You don't level by playing on this mode, nor can you get achievements)  There's no campaign.   The premise itself isn't bad. As a mastermind you spawn/control zombies, place mines, you can even spawn and play as a tyrant!  As survivors you have to complete 3 maps, each map has 3 objectives (ex. find key items, destroy biocores) within a time limit and escape.  However there's no hiding the fact that It's executed rather badly... It's definately the worst resident evil game."

94458529,english,1,952070,"Coming from other games such as Dead By Daylight and Evolve, this game is a wonderful addition to those ranks. I've not had much playtime thus far, but thoughly enjoyed my time playing it :D  It follows similar formulas in its system from games like Paladins and Evolve. I've quite enjoyed the time I've put into this so far, and only wish that I had more time under my belt.  Its biggest drawback is that its still attached to RE3... please, CAPCOM, sell this as its own game! Its really great and I'd love more people to be able to play it!"

I guess you should've put the resources and time that went into this shit that nobody asked for and no one wanted into making the main game longer and better, Capcom.  Stop thinking that adding a half-assed generic multiplayer mode gives more value to single player games. It's not true. There is nothing wrong about a game being just a single player. Fuck this crap."
131551582,english,0,952070,"This game has been a mess since release, tightening up some things here and there with patches but ultimately a hard fail in terms of a multiplayer experience. At the time of this review, I am typing this while waiting on matchmaking (going on 5 minutes now) and throughout this critique I will share my thoughts on why this game should be avoided.  In all fairness, I will start with the positives. When matches work its a fun albeit kinda unbalanced game of survivors vs mastermind. Mastermind simply has to keep people in the experiment until the timer runs out, and survivors have to run objectives to get out alive. Respawning survivors deduct more time from the timer giving incentive to the mastermind to really lay into the survivor group and kill them as much as possible. Gameplay between the two sides is quite different, as the mastermind gets to really monitor the map as a whole with cameras and use abilities via a deck of equipment that is modifiable along with other gear that can influence certain attributes. Survivors get their own loadouts too and skills to bring their own touch to the group effort.   The really big problems? Loot boxes, progression systems, and rankings that are all out of balance make most match ups pretty one sided. Especially this late in the game's release with limited player base, expect matchmaking to be almost non-existent; putting you head to head with people who will have way more unlocked options and experience than you as they steamroll your efforts. The limited player base also makes it a shockingly long wait to get enough for a game. Capcom....why the fuck don't you ever explore the use of bots for your multiplayer games? Sure AI won't quite match a living, breathing player in most cases but in a game like this that hinges on having exactly 5 people then being able to fill empty spots is absolutely necessary when it reaches this point.  Full disclosure here, I did have to stop writing this as I finally got a match, which took me roughly another five minutes making it about a 10 minute wait for a match that lasted maybe a fraction of that. Not the worst game this series has to offer, and can't feel too wronged as I got it for free from getting RE3 (which was mostly good). Pass on this game, its another failed experiment from half-assed ideas given half-assed effort."
77902681,english,0,952070,"Fun idea, but messy execution.  -Game has been in a constant state of unbalance. First survivors were OP, then Masterminds with the Nicholai DLC, then back to Survivors again, where it stuck all the way thru.  -Game has a brutal learning curve: if you're just starting be prepared to lose, over and over again until you hit somewhere around level 20 on any of the survivors or masterminds  -No Anti-Cheat: I've played games where survivors would pull infinite molotovs, gun ammo, first aid sprays, and rocket launchers for longer than is possible in the game. I've seen survivors grab the area 1 keys through walls without leaving the safe zones.  -Community is, when looking at it optimistically, a mixed bag. There's some really awesome players but there's also a LOT of toxicity. More on that below.   -Active userbase is small .The Game's Last Update was the beginning of October, with no foreseeable updates in sight to fix the lack of proper balance. Most of the players have moved on and the few that remain are hardcore players with levels going as far as the 100-300 range. Because the pool is so small, you tend to wait in queue for a while, and you tend to get the same few people over and over again (which isn't fun if the connection is bad as a survivor, or if you're running against overpowered LVL 100+ SWAT teams as a mastermind)  -No dedicated servers, game is pvp with mastermind as host. Games can be ruined via bad connections and you're guaranteed to see a ""losing connection with mastermind"" type warning in every game you play. You a mastermind with bad internet? Prepare to be repeatedly harassed in dms and your profile about how you're a cheater and a lag switcher.  TL;DR - Game is unbalanced, has a small, quite hostile at times community, no servers, no anti-cheat, and no update to fix it all in sight. You'll have more fun playing RE 2 Remake or the RE 3 Remake Proper."

90452445,english,1,952070,"Well, I am reviewing as a newbie in multiplayer games and only as a survivor player in Resistance! I have never tried any multiplayer game, but since it was included with the RE3, I decided to give it a try. I started with the tutorial and then practice, in which I never managed to win in just five minutes. Tried with more time and I just saw how it goes. Didn't seem so exciting or even interesting. But since my first attempt playing in multiplayer mode, I got thrilled! It made a huge difference. Playing for now at least, only as a survivor, depending on how evil and experienced the Mastermind is, the game can be very challenging. Some really good Masterminds, make it even more evil and revengeful! It really gets into you, trying to escape, collaborate with the best way and help your fellow players. For me to say that a game is good and awesome, it must absorb, transfer my existence in to it and make me focus only on the mission/object. And Resistance definitely did that.   The fact that the online matches are relatably short, is an advantage, as you can experience gameplay in different areas, Mastermind difficulty and strategies, and fellow survivor characters. This game deserves more players!!! Com'on guys! I'm waiting for you to escape together!"
77405959,english,0,952070,"Had good potential, but it lacks balancing.  The game is unbalanced at low rank on both sides. As a survivor you don't have enough equipment/unlocks to fight high rank masterminds. As a low rank mastermind, you don't have enough equipment/unlocks to fight high rank survivors. Being required to play 40+ hours disadvantaged just to get on a level playing field will drive away all new players.  The game also fatally suffers from each match being hosted by the Mastermind, who benefits greatly from having a bad connection by making everyone else lag. If you get pitted against a russian Mastermind, might as well Alt+f4 cause it won't be playable.  More balancing and polish would be needed for this game to succeed, as it is, it's critically low on player count and steadily dying."

This was by far the most fun multiplayer Resident Evil experience I have EVER had! There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about playing this game! They broke this game for the benefit of a different multiplayer game they made instead: Resident Evil ReVerse. But Resident Evil ReVerse isn't Resident Evil Resistance; Resident Evil ReVerse SUCKS.

That's funny because the game is an absolute GHOST TOWN right now.  I've been in queue for half an hour, and finally somebody joins and my entire pc slows down by like 170 frames per second... Being knowledgeable about how online games work, I immediatly told myself: ""How the F does Capcom allow Cheat Engine to run in an ONLINE game?"". Also, who came up with the idea of having the ""MasterMinds"", the supposed-to-be ANTAGONISTS in a RESIDENT EVIL game, to look like and be really just normal individuals... How am I supposed to believe that Annette was just working as a nurse all day long in a private clinic, then she got bored and started summoning zombies in the laboratory... Poor delusional Capcom lol they make lies, believe them and try to shove them down people's throats and it never goes well lol  Hopefully, the game can be 100%d even at this state, all you have to do is find a friend to do the achievements with, OR, if you've got 0 friends like me, grab your other second-hand laptop and log into your other Steam account and play with yourself till you get all the achievements haha. This is a [b]1/10[/b] miserable attempt at reaching Behaviour Interactive's level, but you know Capcom? Maybe you should stay in YOUR LANE... Be as woke as you want, but maybe don't try your hands at multiplayer games that are not FIGHTING games... Stay with Street Fighters, and I guess even that which is your main IP you can't handle huh, I heard there is a huge wave of hackers attacking Street Fighter 6 right now, what are you gonna do about it? Let the game die probably lol"
159261653,english,1,952070,"This game has a LOT of potential and a lot of effort and thought put into it. But NeoBards and Capcom can barely hold a multiplayer up, and them locking this behind RE3R really hit them hard.

Locking the better gear/cards with levels requirement was a big mistake, if you're a new player expect to have a really bad time if you want to be able to have somewhat of a good time later on. The concept isn't bad in theory but in pratice it's pretty horrible, the game feels cheap even with those amazing graphics.  The only thing this game does perfectly is showing us that a 4 player Co-op Resident Evil is possible but instead we get a PvP RE that nobody really asked.  Where's ""Resident Evil : Oubreak""  Capcom ? Not even a remake just a port of the two original would go a long way to show that you care about co-op RE."

Please tell me who thought making this game was a good idea. 5 seconds in my first match and I start re-thinking my decision on wasting 25GB on this game. The only reason why they made this game in the first place was because they thought that because of the big disappointment in RE3 they just thought to make this monstrosity.   Capcom: Also known for making crappy RE multiplayer games...  I know a lot of people like me thought it would be cool to have a ""Resident Evil Multiplayer Mode"" but don't just copy and paste different characters from other games onto this. Resident evil 6 was multiplayer co-op and even that was better than this!!!  Look, all I'm trying to say is that Resident Evil RE: Verse as it's priced £34.99 looks very doughy. All I would like to see at least happen is for there to be a seperate, more funtional, story-telling multiplayer co-op like 5 and... 6.

[b] Big Issues: [/b]  - A lot of cheaters  - There is no option to check your and your host ping so, when u start the game and you find out it’s like 500ms+ and it’s totally unplayable the only option is to just leave and get reward penalty or to just wait till game ends and lose a match? Are you kidding me? Give us an option to check ping and “leave” option in lobby if ping’s too high.  - As mastermind you have so many ""dead spots"" on cameras so u cant even hit survs...  - As surv you can shoot camera when standing behind the wall so mastermind cant even see you... rly?

87491117,english,1,952070,"This game is insanely fun.  It can be difficult to grasp at first but once you get the hang of how things works you'll have a great time. There's so much equipment and skill sets to unlock and experiment for both Survivors and Masterminds which allows for a huge array of costumization, making you wish to keep on trying different builds. The voice acting for the game is also what gives it charm, especially the Masterminds. Both voice actors and voice actresses did a phenomenal job. The soundtrack is also something to admire. Each map has it's own different background music to set up the mood for your surroundings and it even changes according to what's going on at the moment; for example, the music gets more intense whenever a Mastermind controls a zombie. As for the cosmetics, there's [b]a lot[/b] of them, ranging from sprays to weapon skins to even zombie skins (for Masterminds). You're bound to find something that you'll like amongst all of them. The downside is that the game's population isn't exactly big, however, it's still possible to find matches without waiting too long. All in all, Resident Evil: Resistance is worth playing if you're looking for some PvP coop action with other survivors or if you feel like becoming an evil mastermind, trying to stop the survivors from escaping."

My best look on this game that made it so fun was the make it as far as you can before the Time Limit is gone, or before you die. You can still get anb-S rank while still dying.  It is normal to have good and bad games at random in these types of games. Playing Solo as survivor can be boring SOMETIMES depending on your loadout, unless you are testing things.

Resistance wants (or wanted?) to be a great piece of amazing experiences for players with its joyful gameplay, physics and graphics, but fails to achieve this because of lack of support from Capcom...   I don't understand why Capcom decided to abandon a great idea, I'm sure it would've been of the best and most-played games of this genre if they had advertised it differently (maybe sold as a standalone game, free to play, etc) and decided to have dedicated servers and a proper anti-cheat system. They left this to dead, at some point they started to see this idea as an evil resident in their company, and unfortunately, Resistance cannot resist the fall of player base due to lack of faith from its creator.   Although I deeply wish (and pray) that Capcom reconsiders their decisions and starts working to get this amazing game up and running, for now, unfortunately I have to say that this game is not worth the price, but if I marked it as recommended, it's maybe on the hope that, as I said, Capcom rethinks its decisions."

XP boosters and lootboxes in an already expensive game does not make it better.  The game also makes for imbalanced matches due to the fact that there is no matchmaking, and the setup of the game mechanics also makes for heavily sided matches.   You most of the time know that you will get a godlike opponent and your team will most of the time suck.   Also the map design is really annoying and bad. (Latest patch bought at least one actually playable map without cramped corridors, still though 90% of maps are worthless design and the mini-map don't help a dime for finding your way in maps with more than one floor)  There are also extremely annoying animations for everything you do.  Lots of troll teammates.  Community is unfriendly.  [u]Good things:[/u]  At least it is pretty fun to play MM. And when you actually have a working game it can be fun to play survivor too."

But then I ran into a few games where the Masterminds were Hackers and there was just nothing to do but get killed relentlessly and watch the time just zoom down to 0 for a Game Over. Last time I played was when they added Nemesis in as a Mastermind which seemed completely broken as a Special Unit. He had a Rocket Launcher that I believed One Shotted most anyone. The final downside was this game didn't have enough of a community as you can only get this game if you buy Resident Evil 3. If this game was either Free with in Game purchases or a Small fee like $10/15 while still being Bundled with RE3 then it would of been great and could of had a lot more of a player base but would of needed the Devs to really take care of the game and get rid of the hackers and adjust the balance.   TL;DR: Game Had Great Potential BUT Hackers, Lack of a Sizable Community, and Unfair Balance Ruined It!"
69338052,english,1,952070,I know maybe others don't agree with me. But I really love this game. It brings me so much fun. I know quite many friends due to this game. Thank you Capcom. Thank you Resident Evil

86477459,english,1,952070,"I played this game for almost 200 hours on ps4. Now I finally have it on PC and I'm sad to see that the reception is bad. I played a little and I didn't find any cheaters so far. This game DOES need cross play (and anti cheat if it's not true) It's sad that you have to buy Resident Evil 3 to be able to play it even. It's everything you love that makes RE2 and 3 challenging. Except in the form of a coop game. The fact that the master mind is player controlled makes it so that every match is quite random. There are soooo many strategies that they can effectively use.  Do you like shooting zombies and using your wits to survive while solving objectives in dynamic modern survival horror combat and level traversal? Then this game is for you!!! There are many types of zombies, many builds you can make, many ways to play to survive and avoid being bit. Many ways to save your team and turn the tides to your favor doing awesome plays. Like for example when you get bit or die you lose time. The remaining match time determines whether you win or lose. If you do an objective or hurt/kill zombies you gain time. You can dodge through a bunch of zombies and use the right weapons to make room to move... Just to get to an objective across and then save the match that way. It's even better when your team has your back while doing it! There are many ways to play and many master mind tricks to look out for. I was just shot gunning one of the bio cores with a yellow herb, shooting dogs that were circling me at the same time while my team was panicking across the room in a crowd of zombies haha  All the resident evil challenges we love in the other survival horror RE games are here and it plays really great with all the deep mechanics!"
85537858,english,0,952070,The game is fun but support for it is basically dead and the only way it could be worth buying is if they didn't bundle it with RE3. I got it on sale for $20 but I would have easily payed $30 for what was a good time.
66909236,english,1,952070,"I think RE: Resistance could be a really good game given a fair opportunity, but you can blame Capcom (not Neobards) for ***** it up with poor distribution, lack of faith in supporting the game with dedicated servers, and not having anti-cheat. The game uses peer-to-peer connections so as the community declined, the matches became very unstable for the survivors. It also created a lot of toxicity in the community because the survivors naturally blame the host for the ""lag-switching"", even though it's just a bad connection that tends to get worse with the higher creature limit. Some people like to blame Neobards for not supporting the game which is not true, I have been playing since day one with 700+ hours, and the developers have pushed many good, and admittedly not so good balancing/content updates. To be fair, there are some balancing issues that make it very difficult for new players to pick up the game, specifically ""gun and mine decks"" that require a specific character with an optimized build.  Personally, I still enjoy the game because it has a very high skill ceiling, even after hundreds of hours I still learn new strategies for the mastermind and survivors to some extent. People don't give Resistance the credit for how complex it is, there are so many different ways to play each mastermind, not to mention that each map creates a different dynamic. The game is not very noob friendly, it takes at least 200 hours to be a worthwhile teammate, and it only takes one bad player to drag the entire team down. After the latest balancing patch, you would be lucky to win 30% of your survivor games in random which is certainly not a positive experience. Many players can't tell the difference between cheats and good players because the combination of certain cards can create some very abusive combination. When the Nicholai was introduced into the game, It felt like about half of the community rage quit because of uninteractive gun decks - they have been nerfed significantly, but you could still argue that gun decks are more effective overall.   Most importantly, Resistance can be a very fun game when you get those close matches with a good connection. I love the characters because they have so much personality, and I love the gameplay depth that it provides. There is just something really fun about being a ""bad guy"" and doing map presents, working out the best way to kill 4 people. For me it was the first asymmetrical multiplayer, I know there are other popular games that provide a better experience, but I guess I just have a misplaced sense of loyalty for this game, probably because it's based in Resident Evil lore. I honestly hope that we see characters like Daniel and January in other resident evil titles, I think they provide more flavor to what is otherwise is a very generic cast of characters if we being completely honest. Additionally, game has a deck-building aspect with many moving parts, adding a lot variety, experimenting and replay value.   [i] The cast of survivors makes the game feel like a cheesy horror movie, there is just something fun about roleplaying as stereotypes in a bad situation which reminds me of ""Friday the 13th"". [/i]  [h1] Pros: [/h1]  + I love the characters, both survivors and masterminds  + very high skill ceiling, good gameplay depth + ability to customize map presets and decks + many enjoyable character skins, even for zombies + fun roreplaying aspect  [h1] Cons: [/h1]  [u] Abusive Decks [/u] - there are certain decks that take advantage of characters that can't directly interact with you. Usually, those decks involve something to do with cameras or trap activation, like shield resets or just camera durability. You will find that sometimes your team just does not have the right tools for a fair fight, and even if you do, it could take a lot of perfect decisions. More recently, they introduced a toxic ""immunity"" mechanics which makes it unclear when to fight enemies.   [u] Distribution [/u] - It should be a free game with any RE purchase, it can't just be a RE3 tumor because it's a completely different game with a different audience. The smaller the community, the more likely you are to get a laggy match. It's peer to peer so it's not like they need money for hosting servers.   [u] Connection [/u] - due to the community decline, you will get matches with people in different regions, making the game borderline unplayable, or impossible on stage 3.  [b] Overall Thoughts: [/b]  As much as some people want to crap on Resistance I think those opinions are based on incomplete information or simply blaming the game for things that devs had little control over. To be fair the game is dead and there are many reasons for it, both in the game and outside of the game. Given a different mindset with distribution and content support, I think it could be a different story. I enjoyed it while it lasted, and I will play it from time to time with what remains of the community... Now I just hope that we can see some of the survivors in the new RE games - can you imagine Barry actually meeting Martin Sandwich...

105686635,english,1,952070,"Getting the RE 2 mod for this makes it 10x better! It's really fun to play with friends especially. I will say that this game does have an unbalanced system, for example, you can be a level 25 and go against a mastermind level 200. No one is ever too OP though. Often, you are playing against the same people and you learn to counter them as you keep going against them. It is a very fast paced game and it is fun to try and win at the last second!"

116882201,english,1,952070,"This game is pretty fun as a concept, but as it's executed it just feels too one sided. Everything is stacked against the Mastermind if the Survivors have any understanding of what they're doing."

112255811,english,0,952070,"Look, I'm glad Capcom tried something new with Resistance, and to be honest, I do get a little enjoyment out of playing, but I cannot deny that the game is in an awful state, and there are a LOT of glaring issues with it.  Let's not beat around the bush and just get into it.  The matchmaking system is atrocious. It's so horrifically unbalanced to the point that if I had to chug an entire bottle of beer for every high-leveled player, both on the Survivor and Mastermind sides, I would've died of alcohol poisoning after what, 3 matches? It also takes forever to find a match sometimes, the queue times are so incredibly inconsistent. I nearly hit 20 minutes one time trying to find a 5th player. I wish I was kidding.  Playing as the Survivor usually goes a few different ways.  -Get carried through the entire match because the level 257 player can weave through the entire map unscathed, grab every single key item in a single blink, and have everybody make it out before you even get a chance to realize what just happened. -Get left behind CONSTANTLY because of basically ZERO communication between Survivors. Yeah, there are ""emotes"", but those can only do so much. There's no text/voice chat whatsoever, so you just have to pray that you can keep up with everybody else, because they sure as hell aren't gonna wait for you. -Usually end up running out of time because trying to rush as fast as possible to the exit while also watching out for traps doesn't exactly mix well. -Most likely get stuck in the first area because spamming everything you have as the Mastermind works surprisingly well, and fail because apparently, you’re supposed to push through Lickers that will down you in two hits, or worse, cameras that can shoot at you and can also down you incredibly quickly. Seriously, the Nikolai update RUINED this game. -Have at least one person disconnect at some point during the match, crippling your team and usually means you’re not making it to the end. -Or, and this is a favorite, have EVERYBODY ELSE disconnect, leaving you alone with the Mastermind as they spam everything they have behind the very first door.  Now playing as the Mastermind you would think would be the saving grace, right? What do you think?  -Watch as the matchmaking system makes your life hell as it pairs you up against an entire team of gold-wearing Survivors, all with triple-digit levels and able to take down everything you throw at them with ease. -Feel bad as you totally destroy a clearly new player being shoved in with people who have 3,000+ hours because as I mentioned, the matchmaking is atrocious. -Have the Survivors breeze through all of your traps and enemies because the Mastermind controls are so unintuitive and sluggish that by the time you have a room set up with clever traps and well-placed enemies, the Survivors have already left the Area. -Trying the spam “technique” that apparently works so well when you’re playing as a Survivor, but have it backfire on you so miserably that you might as well just leave the match and uninstall.  The lag is HORRENDOUS. It will literally take entire SECONDS after you’ve shot an enemy for the damage to pop up. Try to empty an entire magazine or absolutely beat the crap out of an enemy with a melee weapon? There's a very high chance that the game will just give you a middle finger and say you missed EVERYTHING. There's a few times where you'll walk down a hallway perfectly fine, and then all of a sudden get downed because apparently, you were getting shot at by a camera that entire time, because again, SCREW the Nikolai update. And on top of it all, you also have a high chance to miss every other turn because even though you clearly hit left, you’ll keep running forwards for a couple more seconds, and THEN finally have your input register as you turn right into an enemy that downs you, and get left alone as apparently all the other Survivors are already at the Exit while you just barely made it to where the first key was supposed to be. I think the biggest reason why the lag is so awful is because Capcom made the baffling decision to use P2P connections. Are dedicated servers really just so unfathomable to developers?  Lootcrates, anyone? Because in order to get ANY upgrades or cosmetics for your characters, you have to go through them. And of course, playing matches will only get you a certain amount of points to buy said crates, even LESS if you fail. The only way to max out how many? You basically have to do a flawless run. EVERY TIME. Yeah, you can use RP Boosters to increase the amount of points you get, but they only last for so long. But hey, you can always buy more. WITH REAL MONEY.  There are an embarrassing amount of glitches too, like trying to pick a Survivor just... not working as you're stuck on the menu until someone inevitably leaves. Or have your mouse randomly stop working, forcing you to plug in a controller just to continue playing. And my favorite, going to pick up an item on the last Area of a match, only for the game to freak the f**k out and literally teleport you outside the map, making you unable to move and be forced to watch as every other Survivor leaves without you.  What sucks the most is that I can totally see the potential of this game, I do enjoy the game when it works and doesn't lag out to all hell, the characters are unique and interesting, the gameplay, while flawed, could totally work, and the general idea is rock-solid and with some more love and dedication, I think this could be a fantastic game if Capcom actually put forward the effort to fix it and make it better... but sadly, something tells me that Capcom won't do that anytime soon. Or ever.  And again, SCREW the Nikolai update."
77051175,english,0,952070,"I like the escape room concept but there are so many flaws in this game.  FLAWS Timer is way too short. Never enough time. It's like you're expected to know exactly where all the key items are and if you have all the supplies needed like lots of ammo and melee.  I understand that all Resident Evil games, EXCEPT 4 and later, have very small pouches (girls have purses boys have fanny packs) so they can only carry 8 items. Definitely not enough space. 16 or more spaces would be perfect.  Random people are mostly players who want to have fun while this game is so difficult that requires pure skill.  Best to play when you have a team, clan, or guild or close friends who play this with you so you can practice, discuss, or even use voice chat.  It is true what they say about the mastermind or I like to call it (security guard, lol. Get it? Their main work purpose is monitoring and alerting) They are too overpowered and 8 out of 10, they win.  It took me awhile to find key items, there should be a arrow above the characters head that points a direction where you need to go like a compass instead of checking the map, when you browse the map, the mastermind takes this wonderful opportunity to kill you because you are ""afk"".  DESTROYING THE WATER TANKS TAKE FOREVER, A LOT OF TIME CONSUMED. Expect 3 to 10 minutes. And you need to break 4 of them total.  If all the things I posted were updated in favor of the survivors and I mean a huge buff to survivors and a huge NERF to mastermind then you would get more positive reviews.  CONCLUSION This game is only playable singleplayer on free mode, plenty of time, money, and supplies. You gotta be lucky or very popular to play this with people you know and people you practice with.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! WASTE OF CPU MEMORY!"
90692945,english,1,952070,"RE:Resistance is an arcade style randomly generated 1v4 horror game. Firstly, this game is done. There is no more development being worked on, whatever we have is what we have - and we have a lot for what we've gotten. The game can be a bit difficult to get into because you have to get equipment to add to your characters / mastermind or survivor / as MM this means you might be getting your shit kicked in for a bit till you can afford some high level equipment, and as survivor - you can get by without full equipment; but if the MM Is tricked out you might feel overwhelmed by the zombies. This can often give players the perception that the MM Is ""hacking"" when infact its just that they have alot of equipment / levels over you. But, because the game has such a low population - it's difficult for it to match players that are at close levels, so this might happen occasionally, but with the recent sale i've been getting more players in the lower levels of things. I play this game entirely solo as i dont have any friends who are masochistic enough to play this with me all night, but despite this - I still manage to have lots of  fun when im not lagging out because of the MM's connection, or we're being hacked to death. and most if not all the time it's the former. But in the small moments where everything is working as intended :tm: the game absolutely shines. The characters are fully voiced beautifully, the director of the VAs was ON it. They interact with each other and the environment, their voicelines are so clear and crisp and are VERY reactive. it's very immersive. The atmosphere is incredible, and you'll often find yourself stopping to soak in the air while your team is getting mauled to death by and E.I.S zombie. The MM's are very wellwritten - each having unique traits and playstyles that shows in every aspect of the personality. Ontop of that, we also get to design custom loadouts for every character, MM or survivor. This includes changing how your passive / active / ultimate works, and of course those equipments that can increase your durability/damage/health and even decrease negative effects. We also have VERY unique cosmetics for every character/weapon we even have dances you can unlock that you can perform as a zombie when playing MM or as a survivor - and the meme level of those is high af  To be honest, capcom shit the bed with this one - the game had alot of potential, but now it lives in a small cave, being worshipped by a cult following. If you're buying RE3 JUST to play this, please wait for a sale - you will feel so much better about the price tag when you are dealing with laggy connections, and when youre getting shat on by mechanics while learning.  Like, there IS a learning curve - and it is kind of hightened because you wont be playing with complete shitter masterminds always, or complete shitter survivors. But understand that once you get the equipment you need the load starts to become alot more manageable and you'll find yourself having more fun than you were before  PS:  only buy high tier equipment  PPS: also barging into doors is a negative frame please just let your tyrone kick it in or let jill lockpick it - if you have to barge in have someone train a gun on the door behind you"

191119581,english,0,360430,"If there were a ""[b]Neutral[/b]"" option on Steam, I would put this game in that category. Unfortunately, I have to choose between ""[b]Recommended[/b]"" and ""[b]Not Recommended[/b],"" and that's tough because my experience with this game was a mix bag of enjoyment but it also boring me to death.  Mafia 3 is a huge departure from Mafia 1 and 2. Those games had that signature ""Mafia feel"", you were deeply embedded in the mob, experiencing a gripping and linear, story-driven experience that captured the old-school gangster vibe. Mafia 3? Not so much. While you have ties to the mob, you’re not part of it in the same way. Instead, the game shifts gears and leans heavily toward an open-world, GTA-style/Ubisoft formula. This game isn’t inherently bad, but it does cause the game to lose part of what made the Mafia series so unique. The story is really good imo! It’s dark, gritty, and unforgettable! One of the strongest aspects of this game.  Unfortunately, the gameplay is a hufe let down. The missions are painfully repetitive. Taking over districts quickly becomes a chore. You’ll find yourself doing the same types of objectives over and over, and it drags the experience down. Combine that with frequent crashes! I had to restart the game multiple times just to get it running and it can be frustrating.  In the end, [b]Mafia 3 is a good game, but it’s not a good Mafia game[/b]. If you go in expecting something like Mafia 1 or 2, you might be disappointed. But if you give it a chance as its own thing, there’s some enjoyment to be found. Just be prepared for the rough edges."
187271020,english,1,360430,"if your game crashes before it can even get into the menu, go to the file where Mafia 3 is installed, look for Mafia 3  Definitive edition (not the launcher) right click and click on properties go to Compatibility and look for Compatibility mode try all of them but Run this program in compatibility mode for windows 7 worked for me, and now the other issues the same issue they had for mafia 1 is black screening on launch if you have this issue you need to launch the launcher and then change it to window mode, JUST WHEN IT launches you can put in back into full screen mode when you get back into the game you can also try check Disable full screen optimisations i think that will fix most issues of it launching up, ill recommended this or not when i finish the game i just want people to know what to do, so they can play the game and judge it on the game not the bad port for the launch up of the game (also feel free to share over bugs and fixes in the comments :) have a wonderful day)."

184974002,english,1,360430,"I got to buy myself a copy of this game with all the stigma of it not being a ""good"" mafia game. First of all, I must agree it is not really a Mafia game. Whilst playing you realise quite quickly that in reality is about putting end to the whole mafia mentality and getting revenge for those who were lost. Those new allies who were found in the process stood by your side. It was never meant for you to be a part of Mafia, but to build something a little better in the wicked world of ours. Story was great I really enjoyed it. Characters had good screen time ( mainly the allies ). Sadly without much development excluding, Clay, Donovan, Father James, Vito and Sal. Others were good too but for me did not have that much impact on the whole world/story of the game. DLCs were great I enjoyed them all. The first one with witch hunt was amazing story, that gave more time for Lincoln to develop, The second one with Roxy, was more fun but had a great background and I really enjoyed working with The Voice ( voice acted by a my guy Lee from TWD The Game Series :3 ). The third one with donovan was quick but action packed shit show, that was enjoyable too. Gameplay was most of the time very good. Some game mechanics polished over time, but there is still some bugs that can influence your opinion on the game. Its the nitt picky stuff, I enjoyed the game as is.  And to those the game was boring and too long of the same I strongly disagree. Mainly beating small racket bosses and then killing Sals lieutenants. Yeah it had its moments, but I still enjoyed killing every single KKK member, getting rid of the greedy fucks that were ruining the lives of many people. A literal ONE MAN ARMY!!  I can say I did all the SQ too, and it made the game whole. Just one thing is missing from this game. FAST TRAVEL MAN. The driving mainly for SQ was sometimes BORING :D.  8.5/10. Good job Hangar 13. Love from Slovakia."
191556987,english,0,360430,"The current top review kinda says it all. This game should be in a neutral category. I usually keep refraining from writing reviews, but had to do it.   Although the setting is awesome and the racial tension is suspense, the gameplay and gameworld are lackluster. I like side missions, however you always have to drive through the ENTIRE map do complete them in Mafia 3. Which is not a problem in a game like GTA but here... To drive 5-10min in a barren landscape with heavy pop-in is just so.. boring.  The story starts off violently good. You get a reason, you get a narrative etc. But after two hours it just repeats itself. Drive to District A, kill everyone and capture the District. Drive to B, do the same all over again.  I don't leave games unplayed. Today I did."
188164700,english,1,360430,"I enjoyed this game back in the days after its release and Im enjoying it even more now. Here is why. Previous two Mafia games were heavily story driven since you had one story mission after another. This one is closer to the classic ""GTA"" open world formula with many side missions to do (if you want).  I don't mind when games get repetitive if the gameplay itself is fun. And boy Im having fun with this one! The action, animations and ragdoll physics are so much fun that after finishing one firefight I can't wait to start another. One of my most favourite things are melee finishers. Simply get close to your enemy and press Q key and Lincoln  will perform a finisher depending on which weapon you are carrying. It was the exact same way (even the Q key) in 2005 Punisher game. You can also try stealthy approach or later in the game you can just call in a hitman squad and enjoy the firefight from afar. The choice is yours.  Story is actually very good and especially the acting. You just don't see a cutscene after every finished mission like in the previous games. Story narrative reminds me mostly of Guy Ritchie's gangster movies with little bit of Martin Scorsese mixed into it but at some points you also feel like being in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood since it takes place in the same time period and even contains  some songs that were later used in that movie.  Which brings me to the soundtrack - it's simply amazing. What can I say, one classic song after another. You will not want to turn off the radio station!  What about our main character Lincoln Clay? Im so happy that once more we can have some ""walking tank"" type of character. He is basically like Jack Reacher mixed with the Punisher. For a person like me who grew up on Arnold Schwarzenegger movies it's just another plus. And like a mentioned before the fighting and everything around it is just so much fun. Some people say that the open world is empty and there's not much to do except the side missions. To be fair it wasn't much different in previous games. Map basically served only to get from point A to point B to complete the story mission. In this you actually have things to do, which gives you more money, make things easier for you (like if you eliminate enemy enforcers they won't be bothering you later in the game) and your decisions even have influence on the story since there are several different ways how you can progress. Like in all previous instalments here as well was environment created with great attention to detail that makes you want to just walk around and breathe in the atmosphere. What makes the environment feel alive are the npcs. They have many different dialogs and even reacting on what's happening in the story as the game progress.  At one point after Sammy's bar gets repaired you can stop by to have a drink there which is a nice touch since I always liked to be able to immerse myself into the game doing all those little unnecessary things like being able to eat or drink and stuff like that. There is also one nice little detail some of us appreciate and which is usually overlooked in most pc games and that's the walking button. You can just switch between walk and run.  In case of technical issues - Im only having one. Which is that sometimes when you start the game it for some reason crashes back to desktop after the opening logos. Little annoying but all I have to do is just to start the game again and all over sudden it works just fine. I heard that switching the compatibility to Windows 7 solves the problem but I didn't bother to test it. Other than that game works just fine on max details. Not a single crash during the gameplay. My pc is almost as old as the game, which is Ryzen 5 1600, 16gb ram and GeForce 1060 (and Windows 10). Game can look gorgeous at times but I suggest turning off the depth of field and motion blur to make it look less blurry.  So If you like this genre I really think that you should give it a try. Im not afraid to say that this game is very underrated. It is on 75% sale very often and for that price you really can't go wrong.  You can pray on the way up! - Lincoln Clay  Update: I completely forgot that later in the game you can grow weed and even make your own strains! 10/10!"
187472933,english,0,360430,"The beginning was probably the best part of the game, it had story, action, deep moments and character development. Then AFTER the prolouge you go shoot a guy, rob a place and maybe even blow up a warehouse, sounds fun right? Now do that for every single god damn boss in the game :) There is also many bugs, light issues, crashes and even talking to a guy to start a mission won't work"

177702181,english,0,360430,"Good story, beautiful game. But, it has too many annoying bugs and glitches even years after released. I had to repeat some missions due to story not continuing certain points especially when chasing Greco with Vito, stupid cars also got destroyed too fast. The mission design is also repetitive that you better use a mod to reduce those tasks. Also, no fast travel in this open world, especially when I want to get back to the herb house for money. Finally, it really needs a manual save to load when you make mistakes or something. It could've been great, but 2K and Hangar 13 fcked it up with their laziness to fix it. The negative reviews are well deserved."

It's been done a thousand times before, and it's not what people come to play the Mafia series for."
166578693,english,0,360430,"Honestly it's more of a meh for me. The story is interesting and funny, but is overshadowed by the repetitive game-play, go here kill this guy, than go kill these group of guys and get a main mission about killing this main guy. That is the entire game-play cycle, start to finish. The endings are honestly lackluster, and leave a lot to be desired.   I would recommend you pick it up in sale, third party, or at least buy the trilogy which would net you more bang for your buck. A cool concept and great story weighed down by horrible game-play."
165231026,english,1,360430,"I get why people like it less than the other Mafia games, as it's very dissimilar. It's more of a Grand Theft Auto than anything else. The mission are repetitive indeed, and the enemy NPC's are basically walking practice dummies, but it is what it is - 50+ hours of casual fun. Loved the setting, rarely have I seen a city so well reproduced. The story itself, the diverse cast of side characters and backgrounds, and the music, were all excellent. I loved it, might not be everyone's cup of tea but I've enjoyed it just as much as I've enjoyed GTA games back in the day."
179728001,english,0,360430,"[i]As a first time player.[/i]  Mafia III nails the 1960s vibe with a detailed city and an incredible soundtrack that immerses you in its world. The first few hours are cinematic and gripping, but the excitement quickly fades.  I hate writing reviews without finishing games, but this one is boring af. It doesn’t make you feel like you’re part of the Mafia, instead dragging you into repetitive side quests that block progress to the main story. Cool unlocks, are locked behind tedious grind sessions. And without a fast travel system, getting around the massive city becomes a tedious time sink.  A promising start derailed by frustrating design choices."
182762819,english,0,360430,"Its just rinse and repeat. All the missions are the exact same thing with zero variation. The first few hours were so strong and I bet the story is amazing, but they extended the game 20 too long which is very evident from the idiotic mission design. Its just time wasting.

I'd not recommend it unless it's on a huge sale like %85 or free. Story is solid though, liked it."
164698957,english,0,360430,"After 56h in the game and completing the story and all DLC, I cannot recommend this game...  The good: Story, Characters, Acting, Music. Fun in the beginning (see point 3 in the bad). The bad:  - I know it's been said before but THIS IS NOT A MAFIA GAME. You are not some ordinary guy becoming a criminal, you are an unstoppable killing machine destroying everything in your path. You are not a bad guy, all people you kill are objectively bad. They are always some kind of racist. Racist drug dealer, cop, politician... - The game feels like a minimum viable product. The map is huge with NOTHING to do in it. It's missing a ton of features the previous games had and that made them stand out among other open world crime games like the realistic shooting and driving. Collectables are simply not worth collecting unless you want to look at nude ladies. - The game is mind-numbing repetitive. Drive a long distance, kill, interrogate, destroy or steal and then drive back. Absence of a fast travel system is criminal. - The game is centered around racism but I think it handled it poorly. The only racism felt in the game is the use of the n word. Cops only stare at you when you pass by and rich white people don't really react to you at all. Having cops stop your vehicle, ID and frisk you would have been a great addition to show how bad colored people had it back then. - The DLC's are very lame. Random plot with a racist cop, generic action movie plot and a plot about a random girl that we are supposed to care about but I found it very hard. A DLC about Vito or Lincoln's time in the war would have been far better."
169806267,english,1,360430,"I held off on this game because of the reviews. It stayed on my wish list at least two years before this summers steam sale and honestly I wish I had picked it up sooner. I enjoyed every mission, the driving, the music, the revenge plot, setting and game play. I did run into 2 bugged side quests. I was able to come back to them after finishing other missions and complete them.  I dunno, maybe I'd feel different if I had the same experience as some other people but if you are like me and enjoyed the other two definitely give this one a try.  As a native of Louisiana I have to say though, the topology is definitely inaccurate. There is no driving up  into the hills in southeast Louisiana. N.O is flat. but hey, I get it. It's just a game so can suspend my disbelief."
165248431,english,0,360430,"When this game first came out, I didn't have as many problems before the ""Definitive Edition"" came out. Then suddenly, I started seeing more and more problems. Some of the problems I have seen so far are as follows since it became the ""Definitive Edition""...  1.) Mission Critical locations/items/people don't appear or can't be seen when I arrive. It clearly shows that something can be done or someone is there, but there is nothing there.  2.) Environments tend to disappear/reappear as I am walking or driving from place to place, location to location  3.) Although it was extremely rare, there were times I was being shot at and yet my mini-map as well as direct observation shows there's no one there, yet I am taking damage from an invisible NPC.  4.) Because items/locations/NPC's couldn't be displayed or seen, missions that were on a time limit were impossible to complete, even after restarting the mission and even after re-loading the game.  5.) I even went so far as to constantly make sure my graphics drivers were up to date and even making sure I wasn't loading no more than minimum tasks/processes, and yet I still had the above mentioned problems.  6.) Before the Definitive version, I didn't have to go through a lot of steps to get the game to run. When I finally decided to go back and play this game again, it seems I had to go through some steps just to get this game to work. First, I had to run the game as ""Administrator"", I had to restart the Steam app, then I had to even go so far as to make sure all the original files were there and, even though I knew I installed the game, I did get an error message saying a couple files were missing. When I tried to run the game directly after it was installed through Steam, it kept giving me error messages. After reading through the Steam comments, and reading the 2K Games web site, I had to do the above mentioned to get this game to work. What the hell 2K Games? Now I have to jump through hoops and perform backflips to get this game to work? Plus, their ""Launcher"" program, which loads first before you can load the game, is pure non-sense.  Next time you plan to make a game, only to follow it with a ""Definitive"" or ""Special"" edition, give us both versions, not one or the other. This way we can play the version that works better, for situations like this. I swear I did not have this many problems with this game before they decided to update/upgrade the game. The way the game is designed now, it's near impossible to complete missions/quests. There's way too much glitch issues and needs to be seriously addressed. This will be the last time I buy this series until they decide to get off their lazy A$$ and fix these glitches. I've already paid too much when this game came out thinking this was going to be a great game.  Just because you slapped the word ""DEFINITIVE EDITION"" on it, doesn't mean you made it better. In this case, I think you tried you fix something that wasn't really broke. Whatever it was you tried to do to this game, you might want to revert back to the original game because I seriously did not have this many issues before the ""Definitive Edition""."
191110228,english,0,360430,"Ever since the 2k launcher removal, game does not load whatsoever. This issue is the same across all three games ( i bought the trilogy). ass game anyway don't buy even if its on discount!"
189525568,english,1,360430,"It is an 'OK'ish game.  This game crashes like other Mafia games and there is a work around you can find it online. Even after launch sometimes it crashes though it is very rare and some achievements are bugged. If the story mission is bugged and it didn't work as intended, then restart the game. That should fix the deadlock problem.  If i have to rate this among other Mafia games then it will be at the bottom. Story was the stronghold for the  previous games.But here it was very shallow and simple. In fact i didn't even get to do any mafia thing.   As for combat, I liked it. But it was very repetitive. Unlike previous games here you can either go direct or use stealth and there are many options.  In short it didn't feel like a mafia game.   3/5"
190600598,english,1,360430,"I'm having more fun with this game than I thought I would, but performance is a mess. I'm leaving this for future me so I remember how to play it without issue.   Use steam input for controller to work. Mouse sensitivity controls the stick camera, not controller sensitivity, and set it to 0.5. Turn off v-sync because it gave a worse framerate and there wasn't any noticeable screen tearing. Use third party app on steam called Borderless Gaming as the game doesn't come with that setting itself and run Mafia 3 in windowed. Fullscreen had crashed the game a couple of times.  Edit: if it crashes on startup, add the game to nvidia control panel and force vsync on through there instead"
175525220,english,1,360430,"The story was great. After awhile, the gameplay became a bit repetitive which made me just focus on the main and side missions towards later in the game. If you are a completionist, your gonna spend a quite a time doing everything in this game."
177236072,english,1,360430,"Absolutely loving the game. I played Mafia 1 and 2... This is obviously different as in the game play isn't linear.. you can roam around freely and do other side missions. The cut scenes and story is amazing. Combat and driving equally as good! There are some naff bugs where you sometimes can't get out of water and some visual glitches.. but got to say, not had this much fun since Saints Row, GTA 5 et el. Definitely worth a play imo"
171358210,english,1,360430,"Story is OK, still related to Mafia conflicts, its has ""altered history"" for background setting back then. The game play is... I like the open world, this is what I wanted for Mafia I & II.  Unfortunately, their action is miss for me, its empty, repetitive mission, less activities (only Collectibles). Shooting, well, with DLC included, you can beat this game easily with silencer weap. Easy mode for sure haha, I'm not interest playing higher diff.  I suggest to buy it on sale."
171343926,english,0,360430,"I'm a fan of mafia games, but part 3...Yes, there are good points in this game such as cars, music, the atmosphere of the city. But the plot goes very, very poorly, due to constant similar actions, namely, you come to the area and try to take over the mafia’s business. And this happens, just every time, nothing new, the whole game. In my opinion, the weakest part of the mafia series. In the middle of the game, you just get tired of it and just want to end quickly. Here only Vito Scaletta remains from true mafia, and the rest are some kind of clowns. I’m just like an old veteran of this series, I’m just playing, but without any enjoyment in this part. This is my opinion, if you liked the game, I will be only happy about it"
186236240,english,0,360430,"Again still very buggy, while the immersion at first looks nice, on the second the streets are empty, AI is well the I stands for idiot, graphic is not as shiny on a second glance, there are weird glitches and effects with some surfaces. Also sometimes the game gets a stutter and then runs smoothly again or it hangs itself up.  Lots of bugs you might encounter have never been adressed but are known from the start as one can see in the discussions all over the net. Guess it was just a short cash cow for the devs and not much more. Still the story is nice and it can be fun but be warned beforehand, buy it with the highest discount you find."
173423893,english,0,360430,"I love Mafia games, but this isn't even similar to the first two games. The story is not bad, the problem is the pace of the game. The tasks are repetetive after the first few hours, than you just do the exact same things like 20 times in different locations."

177012450,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 felt like a spin-off game, however it did not stop me from enjoying the story and the game. I love the addition of the stealth mechanics. I was able to complete missions, Agent 47 style. And out of the 3 mafia DE games, I enjoyed driving here the most. The way the camera shifts when making a turn is kinda off at the beginning, but you'll get used to it."
187661709,english,1,360430,"Mafia III is a game I enjoyed, but it has its flaws. The story is easily the best part of the experience. The way it’s presented, like a documentary with interviews and flashbacks, adds a unique cinematic touch that makes the narrative more immersive. Lincoln Clay's journey of revenge is engaging, and I loved seeing Vito Scaletta return. The combat is satisfying, and the takedown animations are brutal and well-executed. Gunplay feels weighty, and stealth is a viable option in most missions. However, the biggest issue with the gameplay is repetition—missions often follow the same structure, making certain sections feel like a grind. While the game is fairly long, it could have benefited from more variety in mission design. Another downside is the game's optimization. Even years after release, performance issues persist, and the game doesn’t run as smoothly as it should. Compared to its predecessors, Mafia III loses some of the realistic features that made the series stand out—no more refueling at gas stations, getting tickets from the police, or bribing officers to look the other way. These details added to the immersion in previous games, and their removal feels like a step back. Despite its shortcomings, Mafia III is still a good game. The atmosphere of 1968 New Bordeaux is well-crafted, the soundtrack is fantastic, and the storytelling keeps you invested. It may not reach the heights of Mafia or Mafia II, but if you’re a fan of crime dramas, it’s worth playing.   7.5/10"

Writing is mixed, some stuff is good, some not. DLCs were nice, especially renovating Sammys, but bad that you cannot do anything in/with it afterwads. Roxy was great char, but only little part in DLC, afterwards no integration in the game (Sammys for example). Good cast & voice acting.  Technically it is very bad. Crashes a lot at start up, sometimes scripts don't load & you have to reload to move on. All progress Achievements are broken & reset once you leave the game.  AI feels like CnP from Mafia 2 & then it was deproved (the oppisite of improved aka worsened...)  I kind of wish nobody would buy the new game until they fix this one... :-("

I'm running this on a nearly brand-new desktop, with a GTX 4070 TI Super with 16GB of VRAM and an i9-14900 KF with liquid cooling, and ran gpu consistently at 100%, raising temps way higher than they should be after only a few hours. I have no idea why, other than just poor optimization, especially considering that the game doesn't look very good at all(even Mafia 1: definitive edition looks and performs much better). Render distance is terrible, with cars and whatnot popping pretty close in when you drive at higher speeds. Keep in mind that I played through Stalker 2 twice on max settings without any issues at all, and it never came close to be as demanding on my PC than Mafia III."

177676093,english,1,360430,"Just go full main story , it's quite repetitive. The plot is good but the game run badly and you don't have much more to do than just main mission.  Might be a solid 7 , it had the potential be a good game in the franchise"
173749032,english,0,360430,"Yeah honestly, I like a lot of this game, but the main gameplay loop is incredibly frustrating and gets quite tedious and miserable at times. Especially in regards to enemies chasing you in cars, and really car combat at all. Also the police just function terribly in this game and feel like they were purely added because every crime game needs police. They kinda suck and make the general gameplay loop even more annoying and tedious than it already was at times.  The story is pretty interesting and good, characters are likeable or incredibly despicable (which is intended for quite a lot of them), and the shooting and driving feel alright. But overall it just isn't that great to play through."
176640257,english,0,360430,The story is interesting and the ability to control the city is neat but the game feels rushed including the graphics especially for its time.

183740247,english,0,360430,"Terrible game and much worse than the 2nd Mafia game.   I thought this trilogy was interconnected, but apart from the same character being seen for a second or two in some few situations, these games are pretty much standalone.  There are a lot of bad things to say about this game, the most important for me is that Mafia 3 did not have the same mafia culture and classy vibes as the first game. It just got more violent and much more like GTA. Why they called it Mafia is a mystery  (or maybe they just wanted to milk the franchise some more).  The story could have been good, but apart from the few cutscenes that matter, you do the same repetitive missions over and over again. Complete fail of story-telling and gameplay."

163978149,english,0,360430,"I somewhat like this game, its not as bad as people tend to say. But its still pretty bad, this game doesnt really feel like a ""MAFIA"" game, it feels like your another typical GTA like game. The game is so repetitive and boring and the only thing that kept me playing is the somewhat fun gameplay and the story (which can be pretty fun). The game is overall pretty broken even tho this is the ""Definitive Edition"" Many stuff got bugged and glitched on my playthrough, like some of the achivevments. I would say give this game a shot, but only buy it on sale or just pirate it. Its sad because you can see that this had some potential to tell an interesting story, in an even more interesting era. But it was in my opinion rushed leaving the game messy. The whole game felt almost like ""GTA ONLINE"" but basically without the online stuff. Soo many missions were so far apart you could tell they were trying to prolongue the game as much as possible.  TLDR: Buy only on sale, beware its repetitive, cool gameplay and story."

The atmosphere and vibe is different from the other entries but still great.  Story wise, it's a big improvement over Mafia II, but still can't compare to Mafia 1. I really liked most of the characters with their different points of view and motivation.  The only big issue with this game is that it's quite repetitive which might turn off some people. But as I found the gameplay loop engaging, it was not an issue for me.  For achievements hunters, the achievements are quite buggy so I would recommend to read a guide about the glitchy achievements before playing the game.  8/10"

I will only finish it because there is no other options on the market outside finishing GTA San Andreas or 4 for the who knows how many times already and I need something different. But otherwise ? Yeah, this game is really bad  And I'm writing this after jumping a red light, a cop start to follow me and the game crashed for no reason, again"

170442387,english,1,360430,"On PC, Mafia III: Definitive Edition has several graphical imperfections, such as lower-quality textures, occasional lighting inconsistencies, and some glitched reflections. Despite these issues, it does not inherently ruin the game unless you desire perfect visuals.  In terms of the story, unique missions come up from time to time, breaking up the repetitive nature of the gameplay. In addition, there are three DLC expansions, which add more to the experience without being poorly executed. ""Sign of the Times,"" in particular, reminded me of L.A. Noire because of the investigation aspects. However, a significant portion of the story primarily revolves around causing damage, eliminating enforcers, and securing rackets.  In conclusion, I found the game to be fairly enjoyable, with a mix of structured missions, action, and a unique 1968 New Orleans-inspired setting. I would recommend it to people who enjoy open world, action packed games."

Taking over territories should be honeslty a sidequest, but instead, it's used to fill-in the main game loop. The mafia has been always about the story, but this so called ""story"" is something you'd write for homework to school (and you'd get B).   God forbid I drive slighly close to the sidewalk, because the NPCs will just randomly jumping right into my car.  The police system is just awfull.

193657725,english,0,360430,"Mafia 3 turned me into a conspiracy therorist. Game's so thoroughly broken--[b]every single aspect of it[/b] in fact and I mean it--I'm hundred percent sure the entire Hangar 13 team got kidnapped by an alien race right after the development of this game concluded and got replaced by buncha members of that said alien race that happened to be actual competent game developers. There is no way the same team behind this worked and produced Mafia: Definitive Edition later on, I ain't buying that narrative.  And like the game being a [b]completely[/b] broken mess isn't enough, it pulls off one of the biggest [i]bait-and-switch[/i] moments ever in the history of gaming as it starts out as a fine enough game with interesting side characters, a potentially compelling story and decent combat with great music with a combination of not only original work but also a great arrangement of licensed songs, yet only a couple hours in, everything gets thrown out of the window in favor of a completely unlikable cast of side characters, a mind-numbingly repetitive gameplay loop and an ultimately unintereting story starring a painfully one-dimensional main character; repetitive being the key aspect of it all. This might be the single most repetitive game I've ever played in my life, and since the things this game makes you repeat are also shockingly mundane, I can hardly call the entire experience the least bit enjoyable. There was only one, [u][b]singular[/b][/u] mission throughout the entire game I thought was enjoyable because it allowed some sorta freedom and rewarded my creativity but that's it, there are like hundreds of missions in the game and only one of 'em is a slightly fun one, unbelievable.  As a last note I want to reiterate how inherently and incomprehensibly broken Mafia 3 is because [u]it can't even consistently launch[/u]. Every time you click that Play button, there is a high chance that the game's gonna crash after the intro sequence. My highest streak of crashing-at-launch was [b]five[/b]. Which means at some point, I had to sit through the intro cinematic and the loading screen [b]FIVE TIMES IN A ROW JUST TO PLAY THE DAMNED GAME[/b]. When you consider how almost any and every mission tends to get broken at any given time, requiring a complete restart (with loading to a previous checkpoint proving ineffective) that issue gets even worse. I painstakingly took note of almost any and all bug/glitch I've encountered and the list is as long as Big Smoke's order but I just wanted to highlight this one particularly because it's such a core issue.  Even the inclusion of Vito or the game's overall unique and documentary style presentation that I enjoyed, hell not even the great VA performances combined with brilliant mocap doesn't make this game canon in my head. As long as I'm concerned, this was just a fever dream of mine. If you value what's left of your sanity and your remaining time on this earth, I suggest you do the same and don't ever touch this game. It's not worth it."

There have been lots of games that had rough starts and then became great after the bugs were worked and content fleshed out. This is not one of those. This game is as finished as it's ever going to be. There's no patch that's coming down the pipe to fix this. It's just cracked and any amount of pressure breaks it.  EDIT: Finished the game at ~62 hours. That's having played through most of the DLC content. This game can really wear you down with the bugs. I was playing on easy but it felt so much harder because the bugs made combat that difficult. I stand by what I said at 9 hours in.

Mafia 2 also has no personality, the city is bland and generic looking, which I guess is the point it's just ""anywhere USA,"" characters are boring, the driving feels terrible, there audio is a mess.

This has a phenomenal story to it, very compelling characters, and personally the map and environment is one of my favorites I have seen in a game. The 1960s American South is such an important and compelling setting to stage a game, and the developers were able to capture the racial tensions of the era whilst not coming across too ""edgy"" nor is it too ""woke"". The racism is the background, not the forefront, and the game doesn't insist on any sort of moralism. The only thing that motivates the main character is vengeance, and the story goes to lengths to show that this too can be flawed.   The gameplay loop can be tiresome, I agree, but I found myself very interested in exploring otherwise forgotten and unlikely to be explored parts of the map due to needing to find fuses to hack telephone switchboxes, which unveil collectibles across the map. The attention to detail around the map is awesome.   I think there is some valid criticisms to the game, but overall I find it to be a great game if you are looking for an open-world crime-action game with incredible storytelling. If you are looking for a Mafia game, it is a departure from the first two titles but not so offputting that you should miss out on what is otherwise a fun ride."
192858035,english,0,360430,Cant run in full screen mode and fps are limited to 60. Gameplay is repetitive and rather boring
192434045,english,0,360430,"Attempted to play the game, the furthest I've reached so far is the difficulty select screen without crashing. And according to the game's launcher, my 3060 Ti doesn't fulfil the game's minimum system requirements. Add to that the endless reports of achievements somehow being as bugged as they are, it is a mess of a game that will probably never get fixed."
192250786,english,0,360430,"the game wasn't even starting, so I came here to check reviews. lot of people mention something about game not running in full screen. so I tried that and voila! its running. and for some reason, game luncher tells me I don't have good enough system to run this game. b.tch I have a rig with 4070ti, I think it can run you cheap a.s, so called definitive edition game...  Edit after 11 hours: gave it a shot even with windowed play. It's ok I guess in a gameplaywise but its way more of a GTA V than a mafia game. running around all the time in a open world, capturing districts and repetitive side missions etc. It felt more of a Ghostrecon game.   I agree with other comments about giving it a neutral rating. but since I didnt finished it, I'm gonna still give it a negative one."

Reinstalled pre-requisites (directX and VC++) to no avail, and even tried DLL replacement to use DXVK, but even THAT didnt help. This problem has been present for many users online for years.  Its a shame because this game really seems to want to draw me in, only to lose me with technical issues like this.

192088886,english,0,360430,VSYNC is broken and crashes the game. (Can be enabled in your video card settings instead). Charging money for games which don't work by default should be illegal. Why is it my job to find a fix for your games? Steam needs better quality control. (All Definitive Mafia games have the same bug)
191182931,english,1,360430,"Oh boy, this game left me with mixed feelings. Let's start with the good things. Graphically, it's a solid game with mechanics that are easy to understand and satisfying most of the time. The story is also good, and the way it is told is interesting. It is a bit repetitive, but you can play the DLC stuff in between to have a break from the story missions, so for the most part I had fun with the game. Now the bad stuff... oh boy... what a messy and buggy game this is. It was a nightmare for the game to even open without crashing (the trick is to launch the game through the game launcher in windowed mode and vsync off and after the game is loaded you can put it in fullscreen again; you have to do this every single time you open the game), there are 9 achievements that are bugged and it is only possible to complete them if we do everything in a single session, there are infinite loading bugs and the police in this game are 8 or 80. They either don't give a shit about you or send dozens of cars and agents after you, there is no middle ground.  This game could be so much better if they fixed these issues. Let's see what the next Mafia will be like (hopefully not so buggy). I give Mafia 3 a 7.5 out of 10. I ""recommend"" this game, but buy it on sale for less than 10 bucks."

191119581,english,0,360430,"If there were a ""[b]Neutral[/b]"" option on Steam, I would put this game in that category. Unfortunately, I have to choose between ""[b]Recommended[/b]"" and ""[b]Not Recommended[/b],"" and that's tough because my experience with this game was a mix bag of enjoyment but it also boring me to death.  Mafia 3 is a huge departure from Mafia 1 and 2. Those games had that signature ""Mafia feel"", you were deeply embedded in the mob, experiencing a gripping and linear, story-driven experience that captured the old-school gangster vibe. Mafia 3? Not so much. While you have ties to the mob, you’re not part of it in the same way. Instead, the game shifts gears and leans heavily toward an open-world, GTA-style/Ubisoft formula. This game isn’t inherently bad, but it does cause the game to lose part of what made the Mafia series so unique. The story is really good imo! It’s dark, gritty, and unforgettable! One of the strongest aspects of this game.  Unfortunately, the gameplay is a hufe let down. The missions are painfully repetitive. Taking over districts quickly becomes a chore. You’ll find yourself doing the same types of objectives over and over, and it drags the experience down. Combine that with frequent crashes! I had to restart the game multiple times just to get it running and it can be frustrating.  In the end, [b]Mafia 3 is a good game, but it’s not a good Mafia game[/b]. If you go in expecting something like Mafia 1 or 2, you might be disappointed. But if you give it a chance as its own thing, there’s some enjoyment to be found. Just be prepared for the rough edges."
122590783,english,0,360430,2k Launcher. Hate leaving reviews that don't talk about game but I can no longer play it thanks to launcher. This is my fruitless attempt to give myself some form of relief by punishing them in my small insignificant way.
29925489,english,0,360430,"From pre-release trailers this game looked to be like a more expansive version of the amazing Mafia II, but no.   Pros: +The story, like Mafia II's is very well written. +The facial animations in cutscenes are the only thing the game truly exceeds at.  Cons: -Gameplays is needlessly dull and repetitive. You know UbiSoft towers? That optional ""content"" that was basically padded on to every Ubi open world game from 2012-15? That's this entire game essentially, yet somehow worse. -Speaking of repetitive, you literally go back to the exact same areas and do the exact same things in very short periods of time. -Something about the gunplay feels off and so does the driving. -Even on hard, the enemy AI is useless.  -The lack of content that wasn't there at launch despite being shown in trailers like changeable clothes just highlights how much of an unfinished mess this was. -Despite updates to add new features and slightly improve performance, this game still full of glitches and crashes on a more than capable machine.  -In general, the game looks awful. Its far more bland than the colourful screenshots used in advertisements and the games lighting in infamously abysmal. -Despite the well written story, there is so much padding between key story missions that I'd forget what was happening.    So yeah, this isn't good. Don't buy it. Not even if it's cheap. It's a sub-par bore-fest."
109933836,english,0,360430,"Yet another game where a Mixed review, instead of Recommended/Not Recommended, would be more appropriate.  Where the game shines is its story, cutscenes and voice acting. The first ~2 hours are amazing, with the cutscenes and gameplay elements interwoven to create this incredibly engaging storytelling experience… and then it drops you into the open world, which I will write about a bit later.  The animations within the cutscenes are just incredible. The lip synching, face animations etc. are the best I have seen so far. The textures are incredibly high quality as well. This makes me wish they just focused on the story in a linear fashion like in the previous Mafia games, instead of doing what they ultimately did. Outside of cutscenes the game looks good, though there are some weird looking instances of draw distance behaving erratically, same for glass and mirror reflections.  Story wise it’s engaging, interesting, presented in a pseudo-documentary with interviews with an aged cast of the game. The interview parts are thrown in periodically throughout the duration of the plot, without ever overstaying their welcome, but being frequent enough as not to let the player forget about them.  Main plot missions are fairly original, definitely more appealing than the open world, with some fantastic set pieces. I won’t spoil anything but, again, this proves they should have spent their time on making the game linear.  All of the above constitutes around 20% of the whole game. The remaining 80% is doing open world tasks: 1.	Go to district 2.	Talk with quest giver about taking over an enemy racket 3.	Do $X of damage to the enemy property by stealing money, killing enforcers, or burning assets within the district 4.	Once the $X of damage has been reached, return to the quest giver 5.	Get the mission to kill or recruit the racket owner in a building you most likely have already visited doing the $X of damage part of the mission 6.	Kill or recruit the racket owner Do all of the above 17 more times. Yes, you read that right. Seventeen. 9 districts, 2 rackets for each. No matter how good the combat is, how satisfying, vicious and brutal the takedowns are, how many different approaches you have to some of the tasks, you are essentially doing the same stuff again and again. This literally kills Mafia 3. This is the main reason this game has Mixed reviews here on Steam. I never had any technical issues, but that does not matter, since I have to kill the 25th damn enforcer and burn the 132nd box of assets on my way to kill the 13th racket owner.  Another issue I have is how over the top it is compared to other Mafia games. The protagonist, Lincoln, is a great example of it. Instead of being a regular human being like Tommy or Vito, Lincoln is a Vietnam war veteran seeking vengeance for the deaths of his family, who stands at 6 foot 3 inches and looks like he’s 250 pounds of pure muscle. He is able to run head first into a gun fight, eviscerating enemies with his combat knife left and right. If he gets hurt, he can just jam an adrenaline syringe into his arm and continue his rampage largely unimpeded, unless he encounters guys with shotguns. Lincoln is not a Mafia character, he is literally the Punisher. Why is the Punisher the protagonist of a Mafia game?  The DLCs are on the level of the main plot missions, so they’re good, but each of them is only around 2 hours long. They also are over the top, more like GTA than Mafia.  Ultimately, I cannot recommend it, because if you want to enjoy the story elements, you will require a TON of patience. I know I spent much time on it, but I wanted to know if there is any gameplay variation at any point in the game. There is not."
35854721,english,0,360430,"Not worth the $75.  $20-30 would be more reasonable, although it feels as though the developers were forced to release the game before it was complete.  Being a hardcore fan of the series, especially the second game, I was really expecting something special for the third (and possibly final?) game in the series.   Something about this game reeks of clashes between designers/developers. I feel almost as though there was a group of talented designers and developers with experience working on this game, trying to add quality where they could, but ultimately held back by the poor choices of other designers and developers.  Mafia III runs on an updated version of the engine that powered Mafia II. This feels evident in a subtle way; the dynamics and movement reflect that of the second game in the series.  You play the role of Lincoln Clay, an absolute monster of an ex-soldier who is out for blood at the neck of the most powerful crime boss in the city of New Orleans. Along the way, you build up your own team of lieutenants, complete missions and take over the city region-by-region.  THE GAMEPLAY is good in general, but it is executed and applied poorly. Prior games applied the beautifully crafted experience where you would meet up with fellow gang members and discuss details, work out what your goal was, and then work your way through a set of unique obstacles to each mission such as sneaking into warehouses or following cars to remote locations, sometimes with sabotage from the other team.  In Mafia III, each mission consists of a 'cutscene' in which Lincoln stands in front of some generic random person in the exact same way, and both talk about what you're going to do. Almost every single mission (around 98%) are identical in gameplay, and simply take place at different locations. They usually consist of ""Drive to this gang area, interrogate and/or kill the boss, and trash the place while you're at it. This is the games weakest point, and it becomes repetitive within half an hour of beginning missions as you predict what comes next. The cutscenes are re-used over and over for every single mission, with Lincoln simply standing over an enemy and holding a knife to his throat, then either knocking him out or killing him.  THE ENVIRONMENT of New Orleans is masterfully crafted. I was personally excited to experience the ""French Ward"", based on the French Quarter of New Orleans in reality. Each area is detailed with gorgeous buildings, vivid lights and a whole group of beautifully subtle features that make the world feel 'real'. Walking past houses, you might walk right up to a random front door and hear muffled music inside.  There is one flaw however, there is absolutely nothing to do in New Orleans! You cannot eat at bars, find new clothes, steal from weapons shops, do any kind of interesting activity (bowling, use strip clubs etc).  THE CARS seem to handle pretty much how you'd imagine cars from the 1960s would. Big, boxy designs of the late 60s barrel around corners with horrendous understeering which in itself, actually becomes a fun mechanic; you must navigate your environment carefully.  However, you cannot own your own vehicles in this game like the previous ones. There is no car that is special to you, you must simply steal one, or request a lieutenants man to bring you one of a tiny handful of custom selected cars .  THE WEAPONS have absolutely no guts. Instead of massive revolvers that punch holes in enemies and machine guns that rip things to shreds, each weapon feels like a cap gun shooting bb pellets. The sound design is clear but poorly suited to each weapon, and the gunplay segments are repetitive. Enemies shoot back blindly with no co-ordination or tactics. One thing that did irk me is the inclusion of weapons from the 1980s when the game is allegedly set in 1968.  Something Mafia II did well was allow you a sense of progression in the world. Vito had to work his way up (often for the rug to be yanked back out from under him) and it was apparent through different houses, cars, amounts of money etc. In Mafia III, you actually own no more or less at the end of the game than you do at the start with the exception of territory. There is no acquired sets of clothes, no arsenal of weapons, no garage of cars.  For MAFIA II fans; The game does give a definite, but extremely quick closure to Mafia II, but I would recommend simply searching youtube for 'Mafia III Joe Barbaro' to find out what happened. Vito has changed a fair bit since his time in Empire bay. His way of speaking and his accent are different, now resembling the fast-talking chicago-type gangster rather than the logical Vito once represented in the previous game. He's become extremely aggressive, fast-talking, and seemingly bitter with everything.  + Very authentic New Orleans Environment  + Atmosphere is incredible, can be very beautiful sometimes.  + Incredible Soundtrack  + Interesting lieutenant mechanics, being able to call in favours from others and try to keep everyone happy with owning a piece of the city each is a challenge.  + Driving can actually be quite fun, steering and maneuvering is quite satisfying.  - Story is stretched out and predictable  - Extremely repetitive gameplay  - Poor weaponplay  - Buggy, low framerate from time to time, repeated crashes.  - Inaccurate for the period (ie weapons from the 1980s in a game set in 1968, cars from the 70s in 1968 etc)"

26073749,english,0,360430,"There's not a single good thing that I can say about this game.  The story is supposed to be good but it just isn't! An orphan came back from the war and fights racist criminals who killed his homies. That's it. That their story. I don't know about you, but I didn't expect this lackluster from a Mafia title. And the developers have told the story and shown most of the cutscenes on their YouTube channel anyway. Gameplay is unbelievably repetitive, everything feels the same, like running in circles. Or rather walking very slowly. There's usually just a single animation for each action and it gets very annoying watching it over and over and over and over ... again. Driving cars is not enjoyable in this game and you'll be driving a lot. I was quite disappointed that there's no cockpit view. I mean we've seen it in promo videos how Clay switches the gears and tunes his radio but there's none of that in the game. Also customization options for cars are more limited compared to Mafia II and became available long after the launch. NPCs react unrealistically to hero's actions. I broke into a closed empty club at night and there was just one girl dancing non-stop paying no attention what-so-ever to me until I shot her. Bystanders run straight towards the player to call the police and enemies can't see Clay right in front of them in stealth. Graphics are insultingly bad. Textures are a blurry mess, sky is the worst I've seen in any game. It can turn bright orange in the middle of the night and it changes in such a weird way that you question the state of mind of programmers responsible for that all the time. How did they manage that game looks worse than games from ten years ago is beyond me. Soundtrack which I've already heard in a hundred other Vietnam themed games and movies is great. But it was created half a century ago by people who have nothing to do with Hangar 13. And last but not least. The centerfold girls are the same ones that were in the previous game... It's not that costly to do a new photoshoot of girls in 60s interiors. Overall game feels like a lazy cash grab. I'm very disappointed."

59026047,english,1,360430,"A CRIMINALLY underrated game. I've been playing this game with all the DLC and I gotta say it's has been an amazing experience. I know Mafia 3 is a pretty divisive games amongst fans and regular players, but for me personally? I love it and it's right up my alley.  CONS: 1. Repetitive gameplay loop - Now, I'll clarify this: the gameplay loop never bothered me too much. I loved the combat and driving mechanics, so it never grinded my gears like with other players. I do understand that this can be a breaking point for some folks. 2. BUGS - Now, I played Mafia 3 when all the patches were implemented. Still, I got 2 crashes when finishing a mission and there were some bugs that popped up that really annoyed me. Example: I finished a simple objective in a mission and when a cutscene script was supposed to kick in, I was just standing in place and couldn't move at all. Thankfully, I was able to fix it with ease by loading a checkpoint. Still, stuff like that can be very annoying and can put people out of the experience easily.  PROS: 1. Great story & Excellent Characters - If there is one thing most people can agree on about Mafia 3, it is that the story, writing, and characters are very well done. I actually gave a crap about all the characters and wanted to see where the story was gonna go next. One thing that Mafia 3 does better than most of it's competitors is that it actually has compelling villains with understandable motives - hell, some even have RELATABLE motives. Along with that, the game accomplishes to not absolve them and make them sympathetic. They're still terrible people, but it doesn't mean they're aren't human. Mafia 3's story and characters are definite highlight. 2. Combat - The combat in Mafia 3 is super satisfying. Going in guns blazing or sneaking in like a predator are both options that can be done with no qualms or setbacks. Gun sounds have a satisfying kick and the feedback from enemies in terms of death and injury are very brutal and strong. Headshots have a crispy pop and the general combat mechanics ride a nice line between over-the-top violence and realism. 3. Driving - Now I ain't no NASCAR driver or car expert, but the driving in Mafia 3 is fucking awesome. You really feel the weight of the vehicle you're driving. The sequences where you're chasing someone, or are being chased are butt clenching-ly tense and exciting. The police chases in this game are actually intense! Oh, and the racing is a very neat 4. Mocap and animations - The mocap in Mafia 3 is some of the best I've seen in a while. A definite highlight is Father James, who has one of the most expressive faces in gaming history. When there was actual emotion coming from a character's face, I felt it - down to the individual wrinkles and all. 5. Presentation - Mafia 3's best strength BY FAR is it's interpretation of the 60s during the ending of Vietnam Era and Civil Rights movement. You can feel Vietnam and the racial tensions all over the game. There are moments in the game where key events in that time period are mentioned and even play a small part in the story and gameplay. Hell, the way they tied how the police works with the time period is excellent. If you cause havoc in one of the poorer and predominantly Black districts, police are less likely to respond to your actions. However, if you start shit in the more wealthy districts like Downtown and the French Ward, the police are gonna be on your ass just like that. 6. Soundtrack - The original soundtrack for Mafia 3 has become one of my faves in recent memory, but the real star of the game is the licensed soundtrack. This game makes amazing use of songs like ""Paint it Black"" and ""Just a Little Bit"". It elevates certain scenes and makes them feel ecstatic. 7. DLC - I'm not gonna spoil any of the DLC, but all I'll say is this: BUY THE DELUXE EDITION. The DLC expansions are all great and adds some very much needed variation to the game. It turns the game into a worthy purchase, in my humble opinion.  All in all, I love Mafia 3 and think it's a great sequel to Mafia 2 (Which I also loved). The story, characters, writing, presentation - along with the pretty good combat - sealed the deal for me, personally. However, I do know that it went away with some loved mechanics from previous games and the gameplay loop can be deal-breaker for some players. So what I'll say is that you should definitely wait for this game to be on sale or when it permanently becomes cheap. Buy the deluxe edition to get the full experience with the DLC. Thank you for reading my review."
161384394,english,1,360430,"I couldn't care less about what many people say about this game having repetitive levels or bugs. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this game.  The story depicted a compelling tale of revenge.  The characters were excellently chosen, and the game featured some awesome cars, interesting cutscenes, and a fantastic open world.  The DLCs were good overall, except for one that was bad.  This game had some weaknesses but it was worth my time.  Mafia 1 and 2 might be better, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of this one. 8/10"

132170021,english,0,360430,"It feels harsh to post a negative review after 244 (alleged) hours playing and enjoying it at times. Underneath the janky graphical style is a SOLID ""conquer  the territory"" game that has great missions, good visuals, a well-developed city, a big map, constantly lots to do. Or there would be if the game would just get out of its own way.  Probably the hands-down W.O.R.S.T. port of a console game to PC that I have ever played. Transitions, such as cut-scenes, seem to crash the game pretty regularly, even after all the years of patches.  The map seems open world, but really, it's not. The freedom to face enemies your own way is seriously limited by a top-down 2D design for the tactical map (what you move around in) that says, ""No, you may not climb those rocks to get cover"", ""No, you may not go through some bushes, that's a boundary"", ""No, you may not smash that window and get cover inside that building, use a door like normal people!"" and so on.  It's pretty clear this game was developed to a seriously limited budget. Which is a shame, because the developers had some serious chops, some solid ideas are in it, they've had to cut corners, but they've tried to bring their vision to bear. But, in the end, those limitations lead us to a game that feels very much like Mafia 1 design/graphics/limitations, a game from 2002, in a 2017 game.  So, it's a sad emoji ""No"" vote from me. I think if you can bear with the crap, play it -- I still try to -- but just go in eyes-open: knowing what you're getting yourself into."
28806210,english,0,360430,"PROS: - First 3 hours of gameplay are really great and enjoyable. - America's 60s - New Orleans...ehm..Bordeaux - America's 60s - Soundtrack! - America's 60s - Cars!  CONS: - Pretty much everything else. (Story. Missions. AI. Repetitiveness of game mechanics. You name it.)  Let me be perfectly clear. It's NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game. Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were. You simply can't remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it. Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get. There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities.  Result: Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team  do it properly. Unfortunately, Hangar 13 doesn't seem to have a clue about what original Mafia games really were about. If you really like America's 60s its worth a shot, though."
83163229,english,1,360430,"An amazing story that unfortunately gets dragged down by its tedious, repetitive game design. I truly enjoyed Lincoln as a protagonist, he's a layered character with nice voice acting. The game definitely is not shy to deal with mature subject matter, deals with alot of subjects that might make a few people uncomfortable. The base gameplay is enjoyable but feels off from time to time. definitely not the most refined shooting in an open world game that I've played. Brutal combat takedowns are absolutely enjoyable to pull off. Stealth is bare bones but it works. I do recommend its story, and its solid dlc."

68335044,english,1,360430,"Mafia III (2016) | April 5, 2020 | [★★]  If anything, I think the game is worth checking out for the story alone. It’s unfortunate that the gameplay is so much of a slog that some players may not think the story is worth the trouble. However, if you have the time, the extra coin, and love mob stories, this tale has a satisfying end."
140943024,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 got a bit of a bad rap when it was released, and (at the time of writing) still has 'Mixed' reviews.   This is a little unfair, while the criticisms levelled at the game at launch (buggy, samey combat, poor performance) may be true to some degree, the Definitive edition, with all the extra DLC it brings, means that the game is rarely boring.  Mechanically, the game is much like any other GTA-clone - more open world than Mafia 2 (and much more than the original), but still without an excess of side missions (indeed most combat encounters are either story missions, or in order to unlock the next story mission).  The game has a clearly defined story, but each region of the city must be 'worked' to force the capo of the region to come into the open.  That is typically achieved by finding and disrupting the street level crimes in the racket (the gun runners, the drug dealers etc.) and interrogating low level enforcers until you have forced the head of the racket into the open.  Dispose of both rackets in a region, and the capo is exposed for a mission. The missions themselves are often great, some intelligent set-pieces, and pretty good gun-play.  The grind work however is a little more boring (hence the initial complaints).  All the mechanics are fine, it's just annoying going around the city's whorehouses to gun down pimps, only to be sent back to one of those same whorehouses to dispose of the racket boss.  Fortunately, those locations are great, and no two regions share the same rackets (though there are similarities of course), and the formal game missions are top notch.   The game actually starts with a stand-out mission - a bank robbery gone wrong, which climaxes in a boat race under the city to the thundering theme of 'Born to be wild'.   However, the games first mis-step for me, was at the end of this escape, as we ploughed the boat up and over a ramp the camera pulled away and I roared 'Born to be Wi-i-i-ild'... The game did not however force the climax of the music here (whether by accident or by design).  It's a silly thing, and yet rather than an epic (if cliché) end to the chase, instead the main flow of the song continued and i felt deflated.   The game never again manages to blend the music and stylings so well, and since i heard the song multiple times in the future, maybe it was purely coincidence, but what an opportunity was missed.  The soundtrack overall is great, there's some obvious classics missing, but the period accurate music selection is wide enough, and good enough, that it is highly reminiscent of GTA Vice City before they started dicking around to avoid renewing the licensing - I fear that when Mafia 3 inevitably gets the same treatment, it will steal much of the games charm (but fortunately that is not true yet).  The remaining sound design, particularly voice acting, is excellent, and really sets the tone for the 70's in the deep south of America.  Racism is on display nearly everywhere through the game (though oddly not too much from pedestrians), and is obviously a central tenet of the story and dialogue, but it's played well, enough to make you uncomfortable, and remain sympathetic to the protagonist.  Mafia 3 stands out from others in the genre, by making you give the regions you liberate to allies, who in turn grant bonuses to you - a gunshop, extra health, someone to collect money from you (when you die, you respawn at a safe house but lose half the cash you have in your pocket - so this is a huge perk) etc.   There's also 2 distinct car upgrade routes.   Firstly, for completing side missions for your allies, and secondly at the garage.    The game explains this terribly, but the garage upgrades are purely cosmetic and utterly pointless, while the ones from your allies are worthwhile.  There is a racing series (which i suspect is from a DLC) which this becomes critical for, but these upgrades can also be useful for just generally getting around the city.  The city itself is a wonderful place, a huge bayou area, and then 7 or 8 distinct city areas, each with clear architectural styles, and unique feels.   It's definitely one of the best cities I've seen in an open world game like this, and while it's not so fun to just drive around once you've done the story, it's definitely part of the character of the game itself (and surprisingly memorable to navigate too).  Overall, I do recommend Mafia 3.  While the first game holds a special place in my heart (how many other games have the cops pull you over for doing 35 in a 30...), and I felt more comfortable in the world of the second game, it's a testament to the world building of 3 that while it's not a comfortable world to inhabit, particularly as Lincoln Clay, but that I wanted to see what would happen, both to the city, and to Lincoln. For the other launch criticisms of poor performance and crashes, I had no such issues, the game was routinely locked at my screen refresh of 120fps except for brief moments maybe 2 or 3 times a playsession when the game was buffering in another part of the city.  Perhaps with less RAM, or a slower GPU it might struggle, but I suspect it's been heavily optimised since launch."
76147294,english,0,360430,"[b]Mediocre at best.[/b]   This game was never finished to the fullest. And after re-release of ""Definitive Edition"" experience  got even worse across all platforms. I will get back  to that later.   Game looks amazing and stunning at times. Has great Soundtracks of the late 60s. All tho still not as big as GTA or Saints Row earlier releases. But thats ok.   Combat is pretty good along with the new finishing moves and rechargeable slow-mo ability that you can use on a go. Also you get a bigger choice in arsenal, and not just small arms but big heafty weapons too. Always a big plus in my book, just remember to farm some cash because  they arn't cheap. I guess inflation impacted all. I almost forgot, you can carry only 2 weapons at a time.   Plenty of nice cars to drive and race if you get to that point. However you can't save any random vehicle in ur garage [i]Psst you don't really have one anyway..[/i]    You can only call for the ones you own or unlocked, you select the car from the list and get it delivered to your location just as weapons van or money pick up. Yes there are no weapon shops anymore.   [i]Q: Can I upgrade my cars?..[/i] A: Yes but mostly for the looks, only gear transition makes any changes in performance. Rest has to be either earned or purchased (locked to progress of the story) [i]Q: really?[/i] A: Si.   [b]Districts[/b]  Ahh yes the new implementation to the game that didn't do  anything new. Idea that was pretty good in Saints Row 2 and fun to play in co-op and really bad in The Godfather 2. Here you take away 9 districts (6 if you look for choice) away from Bad Sal Marcanos hands and you call the shots on who gets what district to rule and what benefits you  receive from it all or how much of a cut you get from it... But not to fast you will have to do additional tedious fetch quests if you want to max your earn from EACH! district. OK?! Alrigh.   [b]Story[/b] It exists... Its the rest of the gameplay that dosn't hold the torch to  that story with isn't bad, but has no grip like the old ones.  The best moments are literally when you are after consiglieres. The rest is rinse and repeat Go there and find out what he knows. ok now go there and interrogate this or that guy.. ok ok noww gooo and kill all soldiers till Capo shows up! And you go on like that x 15-16 times. Oh FUN! Worth it!   [b]Now onto the things that made me sad and than mad.[/b]   [b]BUGS[/b] Bugs that prevent you from progressing story, solution? [i]Yes load last checkpoint, no biggy but annoying.[/i]   Random crashes and + achievement stat reset. (You can't view your ingame stats like in previous M2 that would be to much to ask for, so make notes) Game gets to call the shots on that one I'm afraid, and when it dose it resets your stats like: total money earned/spent, how many underbosses you flipped or killed, how many enemies you've killed with specific weapon, melee kills and distance travelled with super car... Awesome! Apparently they use to be fine before the ""Definitive joke"" release, but after it was a different story. I can confirm I have to work around them because  attempting speedrun is somewhat impossible with random  crashes. Be warned! game is unstable.    AI is more of an A than I when it comes to driving.  Doing 120mph on a road (Police dont mind) approaching crossing section, one tw4t! decides to slow down while  you are close by so you have minimal chance to avoid him... EVERY SINGLE TIME! Its like they see you coming and  become brain dead. Because F you man and your nice car.   Ohh and dont even get me started on the laughable ""damage model"" of the cars. none existent. Sounds ok to me.. some say. Yeah well until your hood opens up and you can't close it down like in the previous Mafia 2  [i]I've used the hood view while racing on the busy streets.[/i]        RED ALERT! RED ALERT!! SPOILERS AHEAD!  Hear me out. Ending of the Mafia 1 [spoiler]Story deepens, get immersive  Toma's Angelos wisdom words after being shot like a dog on his front yard. Heart breaking[/spoiler]   Ending of Mafia 2 [spoiler]Simple but still gripping, attaches you to characters Last words after completing final mission. [i]""Sorry kid.. ******* wasn't part of our deal""[/i] Jaw dropping and heart stopping moment.[/spoiler]   Ending of Mafia 3 [spoiler]Little connection to your underbosses Cutscenes says more about your actions, good last confrontation with Sal Marcon (3 ending)  [u]Only one of 'em is cool.[/u] Donovan steal the whole show! xD Aahahahahahah[/spoiler]   [spoiler]Seriously i want to know what the hell is Donovan going to do after his last action. Where is he going to run.... I want to know.[/spoiler]   DLC are alright I guess Well maybe except that last part with renovating  Sammy's place, what a joke.    [b]Summery[/b]   It feels like a new engine demo, with alot of ideas  thrown in together to see what sticks and what dosn't.  I'm all for innovations and risky ideas to change or  improve the experience, that is how we get good games  in the first place. But when the game tries to be different and fails at doing so, Nvm the fact that it has unfixed bugs or that it lacks in attention to detail in some departaments. But when the main attribute of the series (story) fails to make an impact... man something went wrong.   Its hard for me to recommend this guys, especially after  Definitive joke Edition release. And I'm a big fan. I will be honest.. NO! its just boring, no soule   However. 1968 can be best experienced here if your willing to close your eyes on few things here and there. apart from that treat it like a modern mainstream game.  Review note update 25/09/20  Tagging spoilers and sort out my bad grammar along with nonsense I've putted here and there. ^^   Thx for reading."

133873239,english,1,360430,I really enjoy the game. Have played thru it numerous times. Just started back thru it again. I am probably one of the oldest PC gamers still gaming at seventy two years young. If anyone is older I would like to hear about your gaming experience. Have been a gamer since the beginning of gaming...LOL
97967167,english,0,360430,"I have a pretty high tolerance for bad gameplay when the story is good, so I really believed I could finish this game in spite of its flaws. I was wrong. I heard the game is a buggy, repetitive mess with bad mechanics - but the Mafia 1 remake used the same engine and was actually really good, so I figured... how bad can it be? If the story is good (and that's the one thing the reviews seem to agree on), I'll get through it. I was wrong.  What broke me was not the unbelievably high number of bugs and glitches for a AAA game that's been out for 5 years, nor the fact that the graphics are embarassingly bad with the stupidly short draw distances and exaggerated pop-in, terrible lighting effects and just flat out boring visuals (GTA V was released 3 years earlier and looks a hundred times better). It wasn't the wonky gameplay, subpar driving mechanics ( + no fast travel), repetitive missions, god-awful AI, annoying intrusive and unnecessary HUD,  bad UI, or pointless chores like stashing your money after every big mission so you don't lose it when you die. I can live with all of that. It's extremely annoying, but I can handle it.  What broke me is something I didn't actually see other reviews mention at all - The terrible way the story is intergrated into the game: In Mafia 3, you don't get to go do story missions whenever you want to, potentially ignoring all of the repetitive side activities, like you would in other open world games. No. You go around doing repetitive side activities, and after you've done enough, you get rewarded with a little bit of story. The story, while good and carried well by really good voice acting, is basically bait. It's dangled in front of you like a prize to get you to do more crappy boring shit, and just when the tensions are high and you feel it getting interesting... hold it! Gotta grind for another 2 hours, then you'll get to see what happens next.  That's just inexcusable. I stopped when I finally got my gang together, and then unlocked 5 new neighborhoods to go do repetitive shit in before I can get a few more crumbs of story. The game even had the audacity at this point to tell me ""Hey, since this is the Definitive Edition, here's some DLC side content you can do as well!"" I just said to myself - ""Nope, I'm not doing this shit"", closed the game and uninstalled it.  This game is an absolute disaster. Don't buy it, and don't even play it if you got it for free. It's not worth you time."
40016118,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 Pros and Cons  Pros: -Music -Vito Scaletta returns -John Donovan -Fun gunplay  - Actual Story assassinations are fun and new -Explains why you can cut through enemies -Family -Different Endings -Cutscenes are very pretty -Story was alright but different than what you've seen before  Cons: -Lackluster missions -Terrible stealth system -Cars are very weird -Not an actual mafia -Cover mechanics are weird -Weird Issues with lighting - Had to restart missions at some points throughout the game for NPCS getting stuck on random things. - No Joe Barbaro   DLC: The DLC is very different than the main game, it actually offers fun levels leading to the end and you actually feel as if you are accomplishing something. Stones unturned was a very fun DlC and gave me a smile throughout the entire adventure. There is not very much to say about the DLCS  Overall as a fan of the trilogy I enjoyed the game very much, the repetitive missions were not as much of problem to me compared to others, depends on how you feel about grinding. The story was very different to me because Mafia 2 is one of my favourite games of all time and Mafia 3 certainly does not live up to it but it still has a lot to offer to a new-comer or an oldie.  7.5/10"
105752312,english,1,360430,"i didn't understand the hate for this game, but i recently realized the reason why.  mafia 1 and 2 are relatively short (between 10-15 hours), linear stories with little to no pause between chapters, and no great reason to venture beyond the given path. (now for the record, i also adore both 1 and 2 for what they are.)  but mafia 3 deviates away from that. it plops you into a big open world city where you are free to do what you please, when you please. there is little to no direction given for what you ""must"" do or go. added, the story is also about 4x the length of its predecessors.  [b]i sincerely think[/b] the reason this game gets the flak that it does is because those who enjoyed mafia 1 and 2 are people who primarily enjoy the more linear gaming experience. and there is nothing wrong with that! but because of it, mafia 3 can be very overwhelming if you don't know what you're getting into or have your expectations fixed on something closer to the other games.  because there is a LOT to do in mafia 3. and quite honestly, this was the experience i was hoping for all along from a mafia game. i LOVE fighting for rackets, assigning districts, and all of the characters are just excellent. i feel in control and invested, this city is gorgeously designed, and i love a good revenge story. people say the story is ""simple"" but, that sounds so dismissive of what a good story it really is. seriously, does it NEED to be complicated? it's not exactly like the previous two games were particularly complex, but their stories were also great!  as for ""grindy"" and ""repetitive"" gameplay: i only half-agree. primarily, seriously, ya'll gotta get fucking creative! if you're just going in guns blazing with the same loadout for every interaction, yeah, it's gonna get stale. but the game gives you ample options to mix it up. [i]so mix it up![/i]  [b]BUT[/b], as i mentioned above, if you're the type of gamer who only enjoys a more linear experience, i can see this becoming tedious.  but for me? i fucking love it. i haven't been so hyped for a game from story to characters in like over a year.  so to recap/t;ldr: [b]Mafia 3 is NOT a linear gaming experience. It is open world, free choice, and very long (when compared to the other mafia titles). Story and characters are excellent, but if its gaming style not what you are looking for, stick with Mafia 1 and 2.[/b]"
25936825,english,0,360430,"Well, I have been reading through most reviews, positives and negatives and none of them seems to match my fellings about this game, so I decided to write one myself. I'll List pros, cons and neutrals and give my conclusions at the end of the review. Maybe its just luck but I haven't experienced a single CTD and only very few fps drops (After the fps patch they seem to become more common, but still manageable) and one small freeze.  I'll update the review at each new patch or fix released.  Pros: + Catching story and interesting historical setting + Good voice acting and facial animations. + Great atmosphere and city. Makes you feel inside the game and the historical context + AMAZING soundtrack. 60's rock, blues, jazz and country all the way fitting perfectly with the overrall setting. + Interesting characters, rich dialogues and the plot seems consistent so far even if sometimes its feels rushed. + Impressive lightining effects even though there still some bugs and some people that dislike it. + Cinematic narrative. It feels like you are watching a documentary about your character life and impact on New Bordeaux crime scene.  Neutrals: . Driving Mechanic. I personally like it, as it seems like real driving but I guess a lot of people will not think like me. . Somewhat strange animations. (Getting into or out of cover, Lincoln running with a gun and pedestrians animations are particularly weird.) . A not-so-free world. Even though you can just hang around the city without any specific objective there isnt much to do outside the missions and collectables (It seems there will be patches to fix this, wich reinforces my final conclusion) . Racket System gets repetitive too soon. . Cluttered UI. I can go past it, but it's really annoying sometimes. . Textures are not high-ended and polished as one could expect from a 2016 AAA game but it doesn't mean they are ugly!  Cons: - Grainy and often foggy graphics. (The fps patch released on 10/08 adress this, it looks much better now but still an issue) - Step back from Mafia I and II. Shops, bars, clubs are useless even though they are marked on the map, policemen dont care if you are driving 120mph, cargoes dont get damaged etc. These small bits of realism that made the Mafia series unique are absent. - Very restricted field of view (remember GTA 3 and VC? That the map loading was so slow that you could go to someplace before it was even loaded?) (10/09 Update: Fps update adress this as well, it looks reasonable now) - Notable graphic quality drop from cutscenes to actual gameplay.  - FPS lock (30 fps in 2016? Seriously?!) (Even if now there is a patch for that it still a HUGE flaw for a pc game coming out with a 30fps lock) - Bizarre night and day cycle. There's no in-game clock (at least I haven't seem one) and day/night cycles looks totally random for me. - Bizarre control scheme (Why not use GTA scheme?) (I play on a controller btw, things seem shitier for keyboard users) - Very Dumb AI. Enemies and NPC's both. - Overral feeling that you are a playing a BETA and not a finished game. Especially because the next patches will bring things that should already be in the game (as outfit changing, street races, interactive shops etc)  Conclusions:  1) Mafia III is a consistent game with a lot of potencial. Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales. Actually I would give it a 6/10 but it has potencial to hit as high as 9/10 or higher.  2) This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me.  3) DONT PRE-PURCHASE!!! Pre-purchasing ANYTHING is just plain dumb. You are giving away your money in exchange for the promise of a product and NOT for the product itself. This is destructive to any kind of industry as the quality tends to drop as the profitability of that product is already guaranteed before the product even exists. And in my humble opinion this is exactly what happened with Mafia III. A game that was released rushedly and unfinished, with no concern to customer satisfaction as a healthy profit was already safe and sound way before the release date."
40153590,english,1,360430,"[u] M3[/u]  So; like most people, before buying this game I was kinda turned away from it from hearing about it's mixed reception.  I came in optimistic and I played it non-stop for an entire week.  So yeah, I really like this game. Speaking as a fan of the entire trilogy.  The first main game-tweak I noticed that made the game more fun to play compared to [b]M1 & M2[/b], was the open-world approach of; do anything, whenever you want. -- Both [b]M1 & M2[/b] have story missions that are often driving from one edge of the map to another for entire chapters. But the way this game handles 'city district takedowns' with 10+ objectives to go to in the zone, where you only need to clear 5-6 to progress in the story.  Also, the racket-takedown / infiltration parts are not nearly as shallow or repetitive as its reputation would have you believe. You get new weapons and tools, and there are numerous strategies to test and experiment with each time.  -- In addition to the many twists the game throws on that aspect during the mid-to-late game.  Looking at the statistics on, say, achievements, apparently between 1/5 or 1/4 people actually reached the ending of the game. Perhaps this is part in how those critizisms were overblown?  And on the big subject of the game's setting change from [b]M1 & M2[/b]: it's still a crime drama like the rest of the series.  With the characters I'll say, as a huge Mafia II fan and an MGS fan; Lincoln to Vito is the Raiden to Solid Snake. -- That's not a bad thing.  Also on the setting, the game-feel is different and more modernized, this also confused many fans. My best response to this is to take a qoute from [b]YouTuber ChuggaConroy[/b], when he played trough [b]Super Mario Sunshine[/b] and commented on how different it was to all other main-series games in that:   [h1]""I wouldn't say it's unpolished, it's just a different kind of polish""[/h1]   If you're an optimist, you'll most likely enjoy it.  -- Just remember to spend some time in the in-game settings before diving in, the 'kinda dark default lighting', the keyboard controls for movement, combat and driving.   I urge you not to be turned of by the reputation, there's a really good game under its rocky start."

The starting story (the first 20 ish minutes of the game was the best parts, and for 15 of those minutes it's a cutescene and for the other 5 you're in a bank). The story dies off and is followed up by repetitive gameplay doing the same thing over and over again but with different looking enemies.  Step 1: Deal damage.  Step 2: Kill officers. Step 3: Kill distict bosses. Step 4: Make higher ups angry and then kill them (also they spawn in the same place, not even a new area).  Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 about 6 or more times and then call it a game.  Also it's great when the vehicles and ai glitch making it lag and having explosions everywhere. The ai of this game invented drifing 100% All in all not worth $60 in the slightest. More around $30 ish. Just play dishonered 1 or 2. They are much better."
101468353,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 marks the last game in the Mafia trilogy and with the general reception it received, it could end up being the last new Mafia game for a long time.  I last played Mafia 3 back when it released in 2016. I remember playing it, enjoying it and moving on. Since then I've played tons of other games and my opinions have changed. I know that today, Mafia 3 is pretty heavily criticised and has a pretty bad reputation overall.  After beating the game all over again, I can say I do recommend it, but just barely and with a huge warning attached. I won't lie to you, this should have been the best Mafia ever made, its lost potential is found in every damn part of it. After playing it I can conclude that I suspect this game was a victim of rushed/rocky development. For every amazing or high quality aspect, there are some mind boggling omissions. Of course, we will never truly know what happened whilst this game was being made. All we have is the final product.  The story tries a lot of things. While I love the idea behind it all, it feels unfortunately rushed and improperly thought out just like many other elements of the game. You follow Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam War veteran and coloured man living in the fictional New Bordeaux in Southern America in the late 60's. Without spoiling anything, the game is an overarching revenge plot as Lincoln leads a war against the Italian Mob after they take everything away from him. The actual revenge plot is pretty compelling overall. The introduction is quite lengthy and definitely helps you learn many of the characters, making it hit even harder when everything comes crashing down. The game does a great job of making you absolutely hate these enemy characters. The main issue revolves around the theme of racism and the main villain himself. To discuss the themes, racism is extremely prominent in this game. Due to the time period and location presented, I expected racism to be pretty prominent. However, I don't think I am alone when I say this game is incredibly self indulgent in it. You will hear the n word probably almost a hundred times before the game is over. Initially its uncomfortable, but after you hear it a hundred times you become numb to it. Its pretty obvious that the story has undertones of coloured revenge on white people, seeing as you are a coloured man taking down an entire empire consisting of almost entirely racist white people. This isn't an issue on its own, it is however very transparent in pointing towards an agenda when it didn't need to be. The people you face in this game are already horrible people, you don't need to remind that they're racist every five seconds to motivate me to take them out. As for the villain, he is just plain hollow. He is kinda just a piece of shit and nothing else. His personality is that he is a racist, greedy psychopath and that's about it.  On a technical level, this game is a huge mixed bag. Characters can look extremely detailed, but on the other hand some side characters look like they were pulled from a ps2 sports game crowd. The weather effects look downright bad and the sky-boxes look atrocious for a modern game. Some buildings look highly detailed whilst others are flat and bland. The vehicles look really good across the board, however the damage modelling is basic and unimpressive. Some animations are highly polished, whilst others like the molotov throw look hilarious in comparison. I could go on and on, but all you have to do is watch some gameplay for yourself. Its crazy hard to get immersed when the visuals are pulling you in so many different directions.  Thankfully, the game is pretty great in the sound department. Most of the voice actors do a pretty good job overall. General sounds are of a quality standard and the guns sound punchy. The music in this game is also incredible. Its an awesome selection of classics from the 60's era and made driving around far more interesting with the awesome tracks blasting behind me. My only complaint in the music department, is as you switch vehicles you will hear tracks repeating quite often and there is a very tiny selection of radio stations in game.  Being totally honest, Mafia 3 has one of the most oddly designed gameplay loops I have ever experienced. The gameplay on its own summarises why I feel this game was rushed. This also represents where the majority of complaints towards the game originated from. The idea is simple, there are 9 districts total, each containing two rackets you must take over. You follow a simple formula. You do a bunch of small objectives until you do so much damage to a racket, you eliminate the person running it and then you rinse and repeat. Once you have taken the two rackets in a district, you take out the main head of the district, dole it out to one of your under bosses and then you do it all over again for every single other district. The game feels good to play, but the mission variety is seriously lacking. The melee is kinda piss poor, but the shooting mechanics themselves are great. You spend the majority of the game just taking out district after district with very few proper story missions spread throughout. As everyone else has already said, it is a literal grind and a lengthy one at that. You take districts, dole them out, kill more lieutenants and do it over and over.  Here is the warning, if you do not enjoy Mafia 3's raw gameplay, then there is nothing for you here, run the hell away. If the shooting and raw mechanics weren't so satisfying for me, I would not have pushed through, hell no. The driving controls crazy good and the shooting is very satisfying, especially with the late game weapons. However, the objects are repetitive as hell and do not improve over the course of the game.  I know it sounds like i'm ripping the game to pieces, but overall I'm just mixed as hell. The raw mechanics are fun, but the objectives are basic and uninspired. The game is visually inconsistent, but the cutscenes look incredible. The setting is well depicted and the music is awesome. There is a lot to love, and a lot to despise about Mafia 3.  The game was fairly stable for the most part. The game does find it pretty hard to maintain a stable 60 frames regardless of settings, however the game never dropped below the 40's on high settings so it wasn't a huge issue. The only really bad bugs I experienced had to do with alt-tabbing. Everytime without fail, if I alt-tabbed the game it would erase the sfx audio, cause severe stuttering and the cutscenes would freeze. It is important to note that many of the bugs I experienced in Mafia Definitive Edition are present in this game also, which is pretty garbage.  The game took me around 17 hours to beat, so it is quite lengthy, but a lot of that is a district grind that not everyone is going to find tolerable. If you can get the game cheap, I would recommend giving it a try. Its not a bad game, but its got a ton of flaws riding against it. I recommend it just barely, but with a lot of warnings attached. Its a shame, because this could have been something far better."

Overall i guess if youre a big fan of the first two mafia games, and Mafia III is on a pretty nice offer, go for it. I think im a bit more than halfway through the game and i gotta say, the more i play the more disappointed i get.

121165154,english,1,360430,"I don't know why I got so hooked on this one. It is by all means a mediocre open world game - not even close to the excellency of RDR2. But something stange happend (I'd experienced it with DAYS GONE too): I kept on playing and having fun. I liked the writing, I liked the protagonist. It was refreshing playing an african-american hero and he managed to be both likeable, earnest and a total badass. I thought the world-building was well done too: The city looked like a real, geographical place, not a jumble of motifs and the team managed to design some beautiful set-pieces for the main missions: While abandoned theme parks and insane asylums don't sound very original in the context of a videogame, here, they were realized with such an attention to detail that I really enjoyed exploring.  Speaking of the missions: These are hit and miss. Most of the main missions that don't involve your criminal day-to-day activities are great, like [spoiler] your fight against a demonic new-age cult or the hunt for a lost sowiet warhead [/spoiler], but the rest is VERY repetitive, lacks variety and can occasionaly get tedious. It never pur me off playing though, maybe because the developers pulled of some great driving physics and gunplay. I truly enjoyed the shootouts and I liked how they allowed you to seamlessly combine stealth and violence. Overall the gameplay mechanics worked really well for me - save for the bugs of which there still are quite a few. Fortunately, none are game-breaking, most aren't even that annoying.  Story-wise, I'd say, I'm kinda 80% satisfied. Haden Blackman, the man who wrote Mafia III, also writes comic books which I felt was both a gift and a curse, since most of the characters were deftly written and felt solid enough for video game characters, but they did sometimes veer into Whedon-esque quips which I disliked. The dialogues with the CIA agent were particularly annoying. There were occasionaly points where I felt the writing was somewhat construed in order to move the plot along but it wasn't too bad. If RDR2 is the prime example of how to write interesting dialogues and make your characters archetypical instead of stereotypical, then Mafia III was a solid effort with some obvious shortcomings. At least they managed to nail late 60s in southern USA (at least as far as I can tell): Some of the radio commentary where bigots complain about the government's fair housing act because they fear their neighborhoods becoming open to black folks were hard to listen to because they sounded so realistic and were excellently voiced, just like the rest of the game by the way. There's not one weak performance.  So that's the stuff I liked. The criticisms brought up by others are all valid. Mafia III is repetitive, it lacks variety. It didn't feel dull to me, though, and I'd recommend you give it a try if you can get it on sale."
51071109,english,0,360430,"Let's start this review off by saying I played Mafia 2 many years ago and I absolutely loved it. Till this day it's one of my favourite games of all time.  When I heard that Mafia 3 was coming out, I was over the moon and I pre-ordered it which in the end was a big mistake. The game looked promising at first and it had a chance of being something great but it wasn't. Immediately after Mafia 3 was released, I played it non stop for 7 hours and after that I never touched it again. It was dull, repetitive, unpolished and I was utterly disappointed.  Today, after 3 years I decided to give it another chance. I really wanted to like this game but after a couple hours in I remembered exactly why I stopped playing. The missions are repetitive and you will be doing the same shit over and over again in each district. There, of course, are some good things too. The combat system is brutal, the music is awesome and the story seems okay so far but unfortunately I can't bring myself to play this game any longer when there are so many amazing games out there. It's unfortunate this game is not what I hoped it would be."
184974002,english,1,360430,"I got to buy myself a copy of this game with all the stigma of it not being a ""good"" mafia game. First of all, I must agree it is not really a Mafia game. Whilst playing you realise quite quickly that in reality is about putting end to the whole mafia mentality and getting revenge for those who were lost. Those new allies who were found in the process stood by your side. It was never meant for you to be a part of Mafia, but to build something a little better in the wicked world of ours. Story was great I really enjoyed it. Characters had good screen time ( mainly the allies ). Sadly without much development excluding, Clay, Donovan, Father James, Vito and Sal. Others were good too but for me did not have that much impact on the whole world/story of the game. DLCs were great I enjoyed them all. The first one with witch hunt was amazing story, that gave more time for Lincoln to develop, The second one with Roxy, was more fun but had a great background and I really enjoyed working with The Voice ( voice acted by a my guy Lee from TWD The Game Series :3 ). The third one with donovan was quick but action packed shit show, that was enjoyable too. Gameplay was most of the time very good. Some game mechanics polished over time, but there is still some bugs that can influence your opinion on the game. Its the nitt picky stuff, I enjoyed the game as is.  And to those the game was boring and too long of the same I strongly disagree. Mainly beating small racket bosses and then killing Sals lieutenants. Yeah it had its moments, but I still enjoyed killing every single KKK member, getting rid of the greedy fucks that were ruining the lives of many people. A literal ONE MAN ARMY!!  I can say I did all the SQ too, and it made the game whole. Just one thing is missing from this game. FAST TRAVEL MAN. The driving mainly for SQ was sometimes BORING :D.  8.5/10. Good job Hangar 13. Love from Slovakia."

This story is about Lincoln Clay, a US Army veteran deployed during the Vietnam War as part of an elite unit. Back from the conflict, his involvement with the mafia families soon backfires: a deal gone wrong is all it takes to set Lincoln on a quest for revenge.

From the cars, dresses and mannerisms of people - everything just blends together very well in a consistent manner. A lot of the buildings of this very large city are even explorable, which is something the previous Mafia chapters didn't have. The devs also made a bold move in depicting racism and discrimination with an uncensored form.  [b]2.[/b] Shootouts and fights are daily routine in a city plagued by gang wars and power struggles. Lincoln, on his bloody path, will face hundreds of enemies - so the combat better be damn good, and it indeed is. Weapon hits on foes have a good weight, for instance it's not rare to see enemies fly away after being hit by a shotgun, or contorting on the ground mortally wounded, before expiring. This realism does extend also to melee and takedown moves, which are quite a show too. Most weapon classes indeed play out and feel diverse, each with a specific style.  [b]3.[/b] The soundtrack encompassing and eventually emphasizing critical story events is well picked. Radio stations constantly broadcast a stream of iconic hits from the times, along with news and other chatter. Solid.  [h3]Cons[/h3] [b]1.[/b] By far, the biggest issue of Mafia III is the extreme tediousness of its tasks. Be it main missions, side activities or secondary quests, the majority of them falls into a very narrow set of archetypes that becomes stale very quickly. ""Go there, kill everyone, interrogate someone / steal something, go back to base."" Rinse and repeat for the whole game, i'm not even exaggerating one bit. There are some exceptions to this, but they're few and far in-between, way too far.  [b]2.[/b] Hundreds upon hundreds of collectible bits are scattered throughout the city, ranging from CDs to components and other stuff. They are often tedious to get, serve no purpose exception made for Components, and become a constant drag composed of ""get out of your car, get the shiny bit, go back into the car"", this for hundreds and hundreds of time on end. That's not all: main missions force players to first clear certain sets of side activities that always follow the same archetypes, thus further bloating the content.  [b]3.[/b] On paper, Mafia III has a lot of tools, upgrades and weapons to unlock at the Vendor and through raising the influence of Lincoln's associates. However, this progression never feels like it makes any major change: newly acquired weapons or upgrades (which involve significant grind) are never game changers as they feel marginally better at best, so the base combat / driving / exploring feel will not be changed much, nor the variety of approaches expanded by these upgrades.  [b]4.[/b] Enemy AI is dumb as bricks. Seriously. They will mindlessly expose themselves and try to snipe Lincoln with a pistol from miles away, while the protagonist uses a sniper rifle, for example. Enemies will often be oblivious or have very slow reaction times to Lincoln in stealth, which proves overpowered most of the time. This on the highest difficulty even.   [b]5.[/b] Graphics quality is very inconsistent even in this ""Definitive"" version. Some textures or models will be low quality, while others definitely up to par, seemingly without reasons. Draw distance will literally make cars or even buildings appear from thin air at random no matter the settings, while lighting effects have weird afterglows and ""trails"" in many situations, which is immersion breaking. In addition optimization is trash, with random FPS drops at times on a high-end machine.  [h1]Gameplay Breakdown[/h1]  [b]Exploration[/b] Is performed either on foot or by vehicle, there is no fast travel so everything has to be reached manually. New Bordeaux is a massive city littered with hundreds of collectibles, that have to be revealed by Wiretapping junction boxes (shown on the global map), provided Lincoln has enough Components to do so, which are scattered around. There is no worthwhile exploration to do apart from seeking and using Wiretaps to reveal everything in a map chunk, then repeat the process over and over.  [b]Combat[/b] Plays out in third-person shooter fashion, with the protagonist being able to carry two weapons at a time, belonging to different categories such as Shotguns, Pistols and so on. Most weapons either have to be found or unlocked at a trader for hefty sums, same goes for gadgets such as grenades or other contraptions. Stealth is a valid approach to most situations as well, being Lincoln a trained veteran, which can take down any enemy in melee combat - silently. Vehicle combat is also a thing, with the ability of shooting and throwing explosives from most cars, useful during chases.  [b]Management[/b] Consists in progressively conquering parts of the city, subtracting resources such as drug traffics from the mafia families and taking them under Lincoln's control. Several associates will progressively be unlocked for story reasons, each will manage the activities the protagonist assigns them, in turn unlocking specific rewards from a unique list each of them has. Many side missions needs to be completed to fully fortify an Underboss' position and unlock everything they have to offer as reward.  [b]Quests[/b] Are divided into Main, Secondary and Tasks. Usually the main ones progress the story, while others fortify the position of an Underboss or give Lincoln personal gains such as money or other rewards. They are unlocked on the global map as the mains story proceeds.

34240370,english,0,360430,"**Pros**  -Beautifully rendered city environment -Great soundtrack -Offers a variety of tactical choices in combat  **Cons**  -Shooting gallery AI -Dull and repetitive missions -Weak plot  Mafia III is like a selfish lover - it starts fast, climaxes early, and then rolls over and goes to sleep. After starting by throwing you into the action and quickly progressing to the game's dramatic turning point, it never gives you any compelling reasons to keep playing. Lincoln's quest for revenge after his betrayal is boring, implausible, and mind-numbingly repetitive.  The missions have little to no variety: kill, coerce, and destroy, in unchallenging and uncreative ways. There's no emotional urgency or tactical challenge to any of the laundry list of tasks that Lincoln is obligated to complete in order to advance the plot. They feel like delaying tactics to avoid progressing directly to the game's final showdown, instead of elements of a tightly woven narrative.  That's really a shame, because the game has a lot of promising elements that could have been made into an extremely compelling story. The atmosphere of social and racial tension that forms the backdrop of the game is portrayed in a pretty nuanced and thoughtful way (Dixie Mafia and voodoo dolls aside). People on the street freely share their opinions of the social and cultural upheavals of the late 60s, and their observations are generally authentic to the period. The talk radio programs also do a good job of exploring the polarization that existed during the period. And the sights and sounds of New Bordeaux are truly immersive. There are beachgoers, Mardi Gras revelers, heroin addicts, and a whole array of small touches that makes it feel as if you're truly moving through an inhabited city. Unfortunately, the story line fails to do its setting justice.  If Lincoln had been forced to conceal his identity and gather information on his own, slowly revealing the elements of the conspiracy that led to his betrayal, the game's narrative tension would've been much higher and the missions would've been more satisfying. Instead, the game introduces an old CIA buddy who's just completely out of place and irritatingly cartoonish. His sole purpose is to chain smoke and give out information that advances the plot through exposition instead of action. He may as well have been named MacGuffin. The only contribution his presence makes to the game is unearned information, deathly boring cutscenes of congressional testimony, bad acting, and goofy wiretap sidequests. It's an idea that should've been cut out the game entirely.  -GAME MECHANICS-  On normal settings, the AI will occasionally try to flush you out and flank you, but for the most part enemies will generously comply with staying in one spot and repeatedly sticking out their heads for you to blow off. Enemies will also offer themselves up like lambs to the slaughter when Lincoln ambushes from cover, repeatedly walking into the same trap despite the five foot high pile of bodies in front of it. Lincoln also has the ability to pick up and move bodies out of sight, in order to remain undetected. The cover mechanic is a bit wonky, making it difficult to move quickly from cover to cover, or to pick the intended cover in the first place, but given the AIs general incompetence, it's not that much of an issue. The ambush from cover mechanic is one of the more satisfying tools in the game, but as I mentioned earlier, it can be exploited because the AI will never avoid sending waves of enemies to the same ambush spot.  Despite the array of tools that Lincoln can be outfitted with, from molotov cocktails to proximity mines, combat overall is pitifully generic and unchallenging. The wide variety of heights, interiors, objects and landscapes that the game renders so meticulously are never fully exploited. Every encounter is a shooting gallery.  Shooting, driving, running and climbing all work pretty well. Bullet time is available, but the action was never intense enough that I even thought about using it. There's also a so-called ""intel view"" that gives you x-ray vision, and makes no logical sense.  -GRAPHICS-  New Bordeaux is beautifully rendered, with a wide variety of landscapes and neighborhoods on a sprawling game map. Many have complained about the game's poor optimization, but it runs well and looks stunning on my rig. YMMV.  -FINAL THOUGHTS-  Despite its lofty aspirations and beautifully-rendered setting, Mafia III's story and gameplay just never finds its footing, and it winds up lost in the bayou swamps. 5/10  System Specs: Win 10 64 bit | EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB GPU | Core i5 7600K @ 3.8 GHz CPU | ASRock Z270 Pro4 mobo | Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3200 16 GB RAM | PNY CS2030 480 GB NVMe SSD | WD Blue 7200 RPM 1TB HDD"
118606968,english,1,360430,"I know I might be a bit late, because the game came out around mid 2020, but I just had to make this review...  I don't even know where to start.  I'll start off by saying that this game is, for me, at least, the best Mafia game out of the three. With: a really big, open world, a lot of fun optional chapters, three FREE DLC stories that are really fun, and quite long, and an AMAZING story. This makes the game the best one out of the three.  Of course, as much as the game is amazing, it is not perfect. It does have bugs, some repetitive quests, but, that is quite small compared to everything else! I've spent a little over 74 hours on the game, and those were well spent hours. The bugs do not happen too often, but, they sometimes force you to load to your last checkpoint, which takes only about 10 seconds to do.  The story is... a masterpiece. Now... I know that some missions are repetitive, but the story as one of its kind, is amazing. A lot of heartbreaking, twisted, fun, hyper, sad, emotional, etc... moments, make the story a solid 10/10.  The optional chapters are also indeed very fun and interesting! They're not necessary, of course, hence why they're called ""optional"" chapters, but, they really build up a story for certain characters! Believe it or not, if you want to know the real story of some characters, you MUST finish the optional chapters. Optional chapters gave me even more amazing experience, and I would have hated myself if I did not finish them.  Story aside, let me talk about the graphics, physics, guns, cars, voice actors, soundtrack, etc...  The graphics are really good! It really gave a ""cherry on the top"" vibe, because it really is so beautiful. Not too great, not too bad. Right where the sweet spot is! A PC with average components will be able to run the game on max settings at 1080p with no problems!  The physics are also good! Sure, there are a few bugs here and there (e.g. if you turn on Aim Assist, at some points, it'll be more unhelpful, than helpful, but that's not always the case! Also, Aim Assist is recommended if you're playing with a controller, because the general sensitivity for a controller is kinda too fast for some certain guns.) Other than that, the physics are how they should be! Really well done, if you look over those small bugs.  There is a wide selection of guns. I personally loved using a simple pistol! I've felt most comfortable with it. My secondary weapon was an AK-47. Definitely helped me through all the ""Kill 'Em All"" moments, in which, a lot of enemies spawned. As I've stated, if you're using a controller, some guns may be a little harder to use than they should, but, Aim Assist should fix that (partly!)  I am not a guy that's into cars that much, but, this game made it so fun for me to just spend time driving around the map. My favourite type of cars was the Exotic section. Especially the fast, red one at the very bottom! They're very easy to control, and the modification for the cars is also great! (Note: To unlock all the modifications, and cars, you must complete optional quests, hint hint ;))  Each and every character had an amazing voice actor! The accent, the voice, the tone, it all suited amazingly for every single character! My personal character, and voice actor from the game, was Donovan! He is a complete savage, a really funny guy, and also very based!   Oh how I loved the soundtrack in the game. Excluding the radio, the music in cutscenes, certain chapters, etc... It was really amazing! Each and every soundtrack fit the chapter you were going through, so it really pumps up the hype when you're doing your thing!   Also another very big plus that I'd love to mention is the NPCs (enemies). They're indeed very realistic! (e.g. if you shoot somewhere, alert the enemies, move without being seen, the enemies will go past you to look at the location where you've fired shots from! This is a really great detail, and I don't think that a lot of games do this. Most games just send the enemies to where you currently are, even if you were not spotted. It also helps with taking down enemies faster!   Thank you for sticking with me in this review! I was really happy to write it, because, this game is indeed very special to me. Thank you 2K Games for making this masterpiece."
48337899,english,1,360430,"[h1] Is Mafia 3 a good continuation of the Mafia game series?	[/h1]  I started playing Mafia 3 right after my first playthroughs of Mafia and Mafia 2. I didn't have high expectations because I heard bad things about the game from some of my friends who played the game before. They were disappointed. They are big fans of Mafia games but they didn't like the last game at all. I spent 77 hours in the game finishing every single main and side mission and in my opinion it's a great game. It's just not a very good Mafia game as we know them from before.   Mafia 3 is different. I would compare it more to Watch Dogs or Watch Dogs 2. You no longer have a linear story. You have a huge open world and you have so much freedom in there - couple of main and side missions you can choose from and also you can start playing all 3 DLCs before you finish the game because they are part of the open world as well.  [h1] Story [/h1]  The main protagonist in Mafia 3 is a black man called Lincoln Clay. I can't say I felt much for him. He seems to be a very calm and emotionless person. He is a cool and tough guy, but that didn't make it easier for me to really care for him. He is like an empty shell.  Lincoln's story is a story of revenge. In my opinion the main plot is quite interesting and exciting. It might not seem like it at first, because there are many fillers in between the story parts. I always enjoyed those special final missions of each district which moved the story forward. Sometimes you get to know a bit about what's going to happen before it even happens because parts of the story are video tapes from the future where certain people talk about big and scandalous happenings in the city.  My most favourite character in the game was probably John Donovan, ex C.I.A. agent and close friend of Lincoln. Donovan became his trusted source supplying him with intelligence and advanced government technology. Donovan is a funny guy. Everytime there was a cutscene where Lincoln and Donovan met, Donovan made me laugh so much. He is cool, charismatic and self-confident.   Good news! There are some characters from Mafia 2 in the game so you can definitely look forward to seeing them again. They are the connection to Mafia series. Without them it would feel even less like a third Mafia game in the series.  [h1] DLCs [/h1]  The DLCs in Mafia 3 are simply amazing! I think that they should be part of the main game, but they are not, so please be sure to buy them as well if you decide to buy the game.  The main game can get a bit repetitive sometimes with all the open world activities so DLCs are a great way to add some variety. You should not wait until you finish the game to play them. You should play them before whenever you feel like you need something different. The stories are very special and the developers made some nice environments for it.  DLCs will unlock new equipments for you to use even in the main game afterwards and the ""Faster, baby!"" DLC will help you to earn some extra money which you might need for weapons or upgrades especially early in the game when your income is not that great.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  Your goal is to take over disctricts in the game. There are 9 of them and each district contains two rackets (criminal operations). Each racket will give you several objectives - kill, steal, destroy, interrogate, tail a vehicle. For example it could be an auto theft racket or a prostitution racket. But the gameplay is the same in all those rackets. When you take over both rackets in the disctrict you will unlock the main mission which will move the story forward and which has more special objectives and environments.  Once you take over a racket you can increase its earns to max by doing a very boring mission - delivering a truck with some supplies. I did not like those missions at all. The trucks are so slow and usually very far away.  Other boring missions were the loyalty missions for your underbosses. You want them to be loyal to you to get the best outcome for the game ending but their loyalty missions are so boring and repetitive and there are 6 of them for each of your underbosses. 6 of the same boring missions... 3 times! I wish the loyalty missions were at least as good as the Mafia 3 DLCs. They could have had a deep story. It could have been done so much better! So much potential there considering that one of your underbosses is someone from Mafia 2! Aaaargh :(  There is racing in the game but I haven't tried it apart from one DLC race. My game was often freezing while driving so that would be no fun racing with those fps issues. And there didn't seem to be a benefit for me to do it anyway. I could unlock a new car and some car upgrades, but I didn't feel the need for it. I already had all I needed for my crazy driving style ;)   Jokes aside, the driving in Mafia 3 felt pretty good. All controls were very responsive. I experienced the terrible driving in Watch Dogs so I was very pleased that it was not like that in Mafia 3. I like that the police in this game doesn't try to stop you for breaking the rules. You really have to kill someone with your car in front of them to make them care. And you can listen to the amazing soundtracks of the late 60s era while driving! They are so great!  [h1] Weapons and equipment  [/h1]  There were too many guns in the game for my taste. I could only carry two at the same time so I didn't get to try many of them. I usually just picked those with silencers and used them all the time. There is also so much equipment you can carry - proximity mines, grenades,  molotovs, screaming zemis, c4s, sniper supports and throwing knives.  Most of the time I was trying to do stealth takedowns and not alert all enemies if possible. I was playing the game on the hardest difficulty which makes you dead in a second or two without a cover. And enemies are smart sometimes, they know when you are reloading and they try to rush to your place where you are hiding and kill you before you finish your reload. Healing is possible by using adrenaline shots and your health doesn't regenerate without those healing items (at least not on hard difficulty).  I've never learned to use brutal takedowns, I always found it too risky to fight a person using fists when all the enemies around have guns and can kill me in a second. The tutorial says that enemies will be in shock after you perform a brutal takedown on one of them, but I never got the timing right and I died quickly so I stopped trying. Honestly there are so many ways how you can easily kill your enemies so why to bother with some quick time event brutal takedowns???  [h1] Glitches [/h1]  Mafia 3 is full of glitches. Many times mission NPCs would not talk to me if I entered the room and pressed E to talk to them right away. I would just have to reload my last checkpoint and try again. Then it worked.  I completely lost my main missions after finishing the Stones Unturned DLC. It was such a scary moment. I almost lost 70 hours of my playthrough and I would definitely not start over... I tried to reload the checkpoint to fix it and the game just kept loading forever. I got even more scared. So I restarted the game completely and it was back. Ufffff! They should have fixed things like that.  I decided to share one of the glitches with you here in the Steam review. I was healing myself in this clip at the same time I somehow died so I became a zombie and the enemies couldn't take me down but I couldn't move or shoot. --->[h1]  [url=https://clips.twitch.tv/AlluringGiftedFriseeGingerPower] Mafia 3 ""The Man of Steel"" glitch - Twitch Clip [/url]  [/h1]  [h1] Final Verdict [/h1]  Mafia 3 is not a perfect game. But everyone who loves open world games like Watch Dogs, Sleeping Dogs or even GTA games will love this one as well. If you are a fan of the first two Mafia games and you are not afraid to experience something a bit different, go for it. I think that you will not be disappointed!"
78391840,english,1,360430,"Seems this game's two main criticisms were the repetetive gameplay and bugs.  Well, I didn't encounter any gamebreaking bugs so far and maybe one or two smaller ones in my 11hrs of gameplay.  Repetition... I can understand it for the main story. I'm not too far in, but there are some recurring gameplay elements. Thing is, the gameplay itself is quite fun, so it hasn't bothered me yet.  My only other complaint would be the save checkpoints which are sometimes a bit too harsh.  So with that out of the way: here's what I think of the game.  It's goddamn great.  The story, characters, voice and motion acting are tremendous.  Especially the DLC that's included in this version, are amazing.  You can start playing once you're a bit into the story, but the stories and atmosphere are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. Plus, these missions are more linear like the old Mafia games.  In my opinion, this game is a hidden gem. Hidden because of the bad reviews it probably rightfully deserved when it launched, but now this is truly a diamond of a game.  Against all my expectations, this may be my favorite Mafia game yet.  Let's see if it remains so once I finish it, but so far so good."
107343023,english,0,360430,"The game is essentially the same mission in different locations over and over and over again. For an open world game, nothing is fleshed out and there really isn't anything to do but drive around."
69893871,english,0,360430,"all the bugs, glitches, graphical issues and overall poor quality muddy visuals from the original are in this 'Definitive edition'. it's baffling that a re-released 'remastered definitive edition' of a game can contain every single problem from the original release and introduce some new ones along with it. how embarrassing."
30935101,english,0,360430,"Ok, I need to preface this by stating the following:  1.) I was born in the early '80s. 2.) My parents were Yankees. 3.) I'm whiter than cottage cheese.  To that end I have no real idea if the racism in this game is accurate or a caricature, honestly. I suspect it's somewhere in the middle.  I both enjoyed and was frustrated by this game. It's not really a clear thumbs-up thumbs-down vote. A lot of people will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. There's a lot to do, a lot to see, and a lot to collect. However, those of us, myself included, who want a fleshed out story will be a bit lacking. The game does a lot well, but it has some glaring problems that are, frankly, unforgivable.  Here's the positives first:  1.) The soundtrack is killer. I got the game at a deep discount and the soundtrack alone is well worth what I paid for. It has a great combination of '60s rock, R&B, and pop hits (amongst others). It's a lot of fun to outrun police to the tune of ""Palisades Park"" by Freddy Cannon or have a shootout in a quarry to the tune of ""Folsom Prison Blues"" by Johnny Cash. The developers knew how to use music effectively and did it very well.  2.) The map is quite large. This is somewhat a positive AND a negative as it takes a while to get anywhere. However, the ""GPS"" system works quite well and it's very easy to get around with the help of the minimap. This leads to...  3.) The UI is (generally) well designed. When driving you have a rear view mirror and can easily spin the camera around to see what's going on behind you. The speedometer and tacometer are unobtrusive, if a bit useless. The minimap is great. While on foot, it's easy to see how much ammo you are carrying and your health/armor levels. I also never had any signifigant issues with using something I didn't intend to. The game makes it very clear what item it is you are going to do an action to. There are minor issues when two objects are placed too close to each other, but those are typically insignificant. The game also utilizes several different hotkeys to do different things, so you are never in any real danger of picking up a dead body instead of a dropped weapon.  4.) The vehicles generally behaved realistically. As someone who has driven several vehicles from the mid to late 1960s, I can confirm that they are generally just as sluggish and heavy as they are in the game. In fact, I would say the vehicles in the game perform better than their real-life counterparts.  5.) I personally enjoyed the way the game handled the full cutscenes. The jumps in time were handled well and I really liked watching them. They told the story from a Discovery channel esque ""real crime"" drama taking place in the 2010s. It was unique and I liked the idea.  Now we get to the cons. Some of these are excusable and could potentially have been fixed by patches. Some are inherent flaws in the game that cannot be fixed.  1.) The graphics are generally poor and unoptimized. I tend to ignore graphics so long as they don't royally suck. These are not great. You can tell this is a poorly done console port. This could potentially be excused if the gameplay was good, but that leads us to...  2.) The gameplay (after the first act) is dull and repetitious. The first act is done well. It hops around in time (like the cutscenes) and is scriped well. It's generally fun. Afterward, though, is a repetitious wreck. Basically, you shoot badguys and cause general havok in a specific area until the miniboss shows up. You kill him, do the shooting and havoking a second time until the second miniboss shows up. Kill him too. Then the district boss shows up. The boss levels are usually reasonably entertaining and it's clear THIS was where the real polish was done. Unfortunately you have to do this NINE TIMES. It's dull after the first few and the game doesn't really give you any good reason to want to do it again as all the districts are basically the same bunch of minigames with different settings. Even THIS would be excusable (somewhat) if the following wasn't true:  3.) The AI sucks chocolate salty balls. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst I've ever seen, but that's usually reserved for games that are broken. The AI does exactly what it's supposed to. Unfortunately, the AI is very very stupid. Case in point: run up to enemy location, hide around the wall from a bad guy, and whistle. It doesn't matter if you are on a construction site with a lot of civilian AI that's noisy as hell or a shack in the middle of the bayou; ONE SINGLE enemy will investigate. If you have two talking only ONE will investigate. If you run up to a group of five only ONE will investigate. They will ALWAYS investigate. Again, it doesn't matter where you are or if a whistle could conceivibly be a commonly heard sound. The AI will ALWAYS wander toward the sound like a sorority girl investigating a dark basement. They stroll toward you and practically BEG you to kill them. Rinse and repeat until someone finally sees you long enough for some arbitrary flag to fire and you are in unending combat.  4.) The police exist to do nothing but kill the PC. This is an extention of the prior but it needs an entry on its own. The police do not fight crime in New Bordeaux. They do not protect the innocent. They exist ONLY to kill a SINGLE PERSON: Lincoln Clay. If you get into a shootout with ANYONE and they respond, they will zero in on the PC like a AMRAAM. It doesn't matter who you're fighting or how many civilians are getting killed by the enemy's molotovs: if YOU are fighting they will try to kill YOU. There's also no system of justice either: shoot a civilian, get shot; shoot a car, get shot; shoot a mobster, get shot; break into a store, get shot; break into a telephone exchange, get shot; run over a pedestrian, get shot; lighly rearend a police car, get shot; walk too close to a cop, get shot. On the other hand, burning through a red light at 115 MPH, they don't bat an eye. Mafia I, which was released in 2002, had a VASTLY more sophisticated system of law and order. Let me repeat that: Mafia I, which is currently a FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD game, actually had a system where you had to follow the traffic laws and the cops wouldn't gun you down for a fender-bender. They also suffer from the ""GTA V effect"" and materialize from juuuust out of view and swarm you.  5.) After you finish off a ward, there's not really anything to do there. I can't fault Mafia III exclusively as this is generally a problem with open world games in general, but once you take over a ward there's not much point in ever setting foot there. It's interesting to see the businesses change when they change hands, but once you collect all the Playboys and Vargas drawings, there's not much reason to go back. This leads us to...  6.) The collectables are a tad-bit silly and really really pointless. I like vintage playboys and Vargas illustrations as much as the next man. However, this is because I am, in fact, a man. Enough said. However, this illustrates a further issue:  7.) There's not any particular ""advancement"" in the game. As far as I can tell, you are given all the clothing at the beginning of the game. This was rather disappointing to me as I hoped to unlock additional cosmetic features as I went along. This was not the case so I switched between looking like Laurence Fishburne in ""Apocalypse Now"" to Laurence Fishburne playing Malcom X to an extra from ""Shaft."" In addition, you have a large variety of weapons, that are pretty much ALL available at the beginning of the game, and are all pretty dull. The Colt 1911 was pretty much the same as the Browning 9mm which was pretty much the same as the Colt Python.  In conclusion (since I'm running low on space) the game is not really worth it IMO unless you enjoy doing the same thing over and over to really good music."
29524762,english,0,360430,"I loved Mafia 1 and Mafia 2... the gameplay in Mafia 3 was very lackluster. The game has been transformed to be a wannabe GTA, so if it's going to go there, it delivers poorly. It scratches the surface of gameplay elements we enjoy in similar-looking games like GTA, but with little freedom of choice and poor variety. I love the story idea but story alone is not enough to keep me playing until the end unless it really engages you with lead character development like in former Mafia titles. It's the same problem I have with recent Assassin's Creed games, although the AC games deliver tons of content but still manages to feel repetitive due to the side-quest nature of everything."
80666006,english,0,360430,"The story and characters are pretty good but once you've played the game for about an hour you've seen all it has to offer. Boring, repetitive and uninspired gameplay. You pick up fuses, wiretap a fuse box, maybe kill two targets and then take over a racket. That's the whole game."
45697992,english,1,360430,"[h1]Mafia lll[/h1]  Mafia lll has been a bit of a bumpy journey for me, good and bad, with mixed feelings. However, I feel the need to overall give this game a positive rating. I will go through the basics [i]without spoilers[/i] of the positive and negatives about this game.  [h1]Storyline/Cutscenes[/h1]  The setting takes places in a New Orleans fantasy during the Vietnam times, as you take place of a man named Lincoln Clay, who has returned from the war, and things turn nasty rather quickly. However, that's up to you to find out what happens.  The setting in this game is rather different than the other titles, this game does not much involved you much in the Mafia, however, you do deal with them still, just not like how it was like in the past.  The Cutscenes are good and bad at the same time. Some are just awesome, even with a gunfight with a sequence song playing in the background. However, some are just simple dialogue, where Lincoln stands still awkward, which is one of the drawbacks in the game because it's all the same when it happens. I'll get more into this at the end of my review.  Overall, the story is very good and engaging for me to continue playing the game. Each step of a territory taken with the people you are working with was one step closer to the climax. There will be a lot of gunfights, whether on foot and by car with police on your tail. The average time for me to finish the Campaign would have to be 20 hours, I did milk a lot with other side objectives and the DLC stories with my total of 40 hours.  [h1]Performance and Graphics[/h1]  Graphics are alright, but they do look like they aren't rendered correctly, and just look awful. I'm not picky with graphics, I mandatory Gameplay and Storylines more, especially for this type of game. However, sometimes the game does look damn beautiful, especially at night time. Textures would look weird, and the game just stutters bad, I MEAN BAD. IT EVEN RAINS WHEN ITS SUNNY OUT, CLEAR SKIES, IT TRIGGERS ME!   My system isn't the best, however, some people have been having issues, even with a system far better than mine. If you want a reference, I'm running High Settings with an FX 8320 and an RX 480 8GB with 16GB DDR3 average of 40-60, sometimes dipping lower with that terrible stuttering. Mafia lll is known to stutter a lot. I also had more massive stuttering occurs with a TV as a monitor when I got the game, however, it improved when I got a monitor. Again, it could be my system, however, the game has a lot of reports of lack of optimization, even on console.  Overall, if you can defeat the stutterings of eliminating it or dealing with it, you'll be fine.  [h1]The Progression and Side Activies[/h1]  Mafia lll is very, very, very repetitive, that was the one huge drawback I had about this game. It took me a long time to finish, however, taking breakers here and there, I was able to finish it eventually.   Basically here's how Mafia lll is in a nutshell:  > You go raid a place, shoot it up, steal money or break objects, interrogate this dude and repeat. > Or Chase this guy, kill him, and walk away.  You'll have certain targets to take down, which will be locked, you need to complete little strongholds or ""Operations"" in order to flush out the main person you need to take out. Again, repetitive.  Once you take down the Boss's or all Operations in a certain area or ""District"", you can choose who owns that, not going to spoil who, however.  After gaining more income, racking more to a certain District, you earn upgrades, such as guns, perks to help you such as reduce recoil, and health upgrades. You also get Hitman to assist you while in combat if needed. Cell phone jammers and car deliver, which vehicles also can be unlocked for an instant delivery. Yes, you can also upgrade your vehicles, however, nothing detailed, even less detailed than the last Mafia titles. However, I expect this honestly, I'm not too disappointed.  [U]Other Activies[/U]  You have other Activities, which include:  - Weed Operations (DLC Required: Faster Baby) - Hitman Jobs - Street Racing - Collectables such as Playboy's again - And a few more not mentioned...  Overall, the game does keep you occupied for a while, even without DLC, but Mafia lll is a game where it's all ""Fetch Quest"", which is again a huge drawback to me, and quite a few others.  [h1]My Final Summary[/h1]  [u]Simplified Pro's and Cons:[/u]  The Pros: - A very good story that was engaging to me. - A very good era, cars, location, music, it's all perfect. - Decent amount of activities - DLC's are decent as well if you have a chance to pick them up. - Awesome takedowns, I have to admit they never get old to do. - Alligators that eat you - Lincoln Clay a bad A$$ mother trucker  The Cons: - Repetitive asf - Optimization and Graphical issues - Some bugs happening where it requires a re-loading - Recycled Animations, such as Interrogations - Rather lacking the ""Mafia"" part. - ""Fetch based"" missions  Overall, the game is decent, not the worst, the game is rough. The story is good, the time/era and everything about it is awesome to me, I'm sure some may agree where I'm coming from. If you're able to by-pass the issues and actually play the game for the story and tolerate, completing the repetitive missions, I personally would say it's worth it. The DLC's aren't bad either to try, they will add more gameplay and new explorable locations and new characters to meet, but those will be separate reviews.  Is it the best Mafia game? No, not in my opinion, however, it's still good and exceptional. Well, is this worth Full Price? No, I honestly would highly recommend $15 at least, even better you can snag it with DLC at that price. When the game launched on its first good sale, I got the game and it's DLC for only $17!  Either way, Lincoln Clay has been fun to play as through my journey playing Mafia lll, even though it took my awhile to complete the story, I feel satisfied on the ending, and meeting some old friends."
50100294,english,0,360430,"When this game first came out, all I kept reading was how buggy it was. I chose not to get it, which was a shame because I was such a fan of the Mafia series to date, but I am not the type of person who can spend launch prices on a game and overlook bugs. So, instead, I waited. For a long, long... long... time. And I hate to say everyone, it was not in any way worth the wait.  I wanted to like this game. The characters all seemed really intriguing right from the start, and I was liking the environment a lot. But it took less than four hours of game-play to realize if I wasn't stuck in a repetitive task it was solely because the game had decided to thrust me into another unbearably long cut-scene, often right in the middle of combat. A few hours later, I found myself hitting an unskippable cut-scene, getting up, making my way downstairs, making a cup of tea, putting on the TV, and getting lost in a show entirely forgetting I was even playing this game only to come back to find my character standing there like a fool.  I need to be fair in this review and say I haven't finished it yet. But the reality is, I don't want to. I have no desire to boot it up anymore, I have no interest in launching into the game to drive to a location, whistle a few times, stealth kill everyone without any challenge, and then wait 25 minutes while the game tries to teach me a lesson about how messed up the US government used to be. It's just.. so...... boring."
94254649,english,1,360430,"This game gets hated on for it's repetitiveness, and rightfully so... But the game has a charm I can't quite figure out."
191556987,english,0,360430,"The current top review kinda says it all. This game should be in a neutral category. I usually keep refraining from writing reviews, but had to do it.   Although the setting is awesome and the racial tension is suspense, the gameplay and gameworld are lackluster. I like side missions, however you always have to drive through the ENTIRE map do complete them in Mafia 3. Which is not a problem in a game like GTA but here... To drive 5-10min in a barren landscape with heavy pop-in is just so.. boring.  The story starts off violently good. You get a reason, you get a narrative etc. But after two hours it just repeats itself. Drive to District A, kill everyone and capture the District. Drive to B, do the same all over again.  I don't leave games unplayed. Today I did."
77743457,english,0,360430,Bad optimization... the game got even worse after update to Definitive Edition
139797223,english,1,360430,Despite the fact that this game isnt popular with MAFIA fans (they hate this part actually) I pretty much enjoyed this part  1.One of the best soundtracks 2.1970's magnificant atmosphere 3.Face mimics and nice cutscenes  i would say its a OK Game  7.5/10
188164700,english,1,360430,"I enjoyed this game back in the days after its release and Im enjoying it even more now. Here is why. Previous two Mafia games were heavily story driven since you had one story mission after another. This one is closer to the classic ""GTA"" open world formula with many side missions to do (if you want).  I don't mind when games get repetitive if the gameplay itself is fun. And boy Im having fun with this one! The action, animations and ragdoll physics are so much fun that after finishing one firefight I can't wait to start another. One of my most favourite things are melee finishers. Simply get close to your enemy and press Q key and Lincoln  will perform a finisher depending on which weapon you are carrying. It was the exact same way (even the Q key) in 2005 Punisher game. You can also try stealthy approach or later in the game you can just call in a hitman squad and enjoy the firefight from afar. The choice is yours.  Story is actually very good and especially the acting. You just don't see a cutscene after every finished mission like in the previous games. Story narrative reminds me mostly of Guy Ritchie's gangster movies with little bit of Martin Scorsese mixed into it but at some points you also feel like being in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood since it takes place in the same time period and even contains  some songs that were later used in that movie.  Which brings me to the soundtrack - it's simply amazing. What can I say, one classic song after another. You will not want to turn off the radio station!  What about our main character Lincoln Clay? Im so happy that once more we can have some ""walking tank"" type of character. He is basically like Jack Reacher mixed with the Punisher. For a person like me who grew up on Arnold Schwarzenegger movies it's just another plus. And like a mentioned before the fighting and everything around it is just so much fun. Some people say that the open world is empty and there's not much to do except the side missions. To be fair it wasn't much different in previous games. Map basically served only to get from point A to point B to complete the story mission. In this you actually have things to do, which gives you more money, make things easier for you (like if you eliminate enemy enforcers they won't be bothering you later in the game) and your decisions even have influence on the story since there are several different ways how you can progress. Like in all previous instalments here as well was environment created with great attention to detail that makes you want to just walk around and breathe in the atmosphere. What makes the environment feel alive are the npcs. They have many different dialogs and even reacting on what's happening in the story as the game progress.  At one point after Sammy's bar gets repaired you can stop by to have a drink there which is a nice touch since I always liked to be able to immerse myself into the game doing all those little unnecessary things like being able to eat or drink and stuff like that. There is also one nice little detail some of us appreciate and which is usually overlooked in most pc games and that's the walking button. You can just switch between walk and run.  In case of technical issues - Im only having one. Which is that sometimes when you start the game it for some reason crashes back to desktop after the opening logos. Little annoying but all I have to do is just to start the game again and all over sudden it works just fine. I heard that switching the compatibility to Windows 7 solves the problem but I didn't bother to test it. Other than that game works just fine on max details. Not a single crash during the gameplay. My pc is almost as old as the game, which is Ryzen 5 1600, 16gb ram and GeForce 1060 (and Windows 10). Game can look gorgeous at times but I suggest turning off the depth of field and motion blur to make it look less blurry.  So If you like this genre I really think that you should give it a try. Im not afraid to say that this game is very underrated. It is on 75% sale very often and for that price you really can't go wrong.  You can pray on the way up! - Lincoln Clay  Update: I completely forgot that later in the game you can grow weed and even make your own strains! 10/10!"
187472933,english,0,360430,"The beginning was probably the best part of the game, it had story, action, deep moments and character development. Then AFTER the prolouge you go shoot a guy, rob a place and maybe even blow up a warehouse, sounds fun right? Now do that for every single god damn boss in the game :) There is also many bugs, light issues, crashes and even talking to a guy to start a mission won't work"
25915563,english,0,360430,"TL/DR: save yourself some time and money if you're new to the mafia franchise and buy mafia 2.  *UPDATED* for those interested review follows:  ♥♥♥♥ textures (muddy,grainy, blurry with some SERIOUSLY low res roads walls and general environment) that look like they were ripped straight out of Prototype (a game from 2008 WTF 2K?),   story is basically shadow of mordor set in new orleans (Same premise same gameplay BUT NOW WITH GUNS AND CARS! Boss mechanics and story points are basically ripped sraight from Shadow of Mordor along with the whole story being near identical... but being set in 1960's america) standard revenge storyline low stress,   I've noticed a whole lot of people commenting on the story of the game and how ""brave"" the developers were to take on a troubled era in American history (rampant racism being the main trouble) and while I might not have been alive in the 1960's (I'm 20) i do feel compelled to comment on the use of racism in this game: It appears that the use of racism is purely there as fluff to distract from the fact that the character interaction is really non-existent and very poorly written (probably in an attempt to make you feel something that the character fail to evoke) with completely forgettable characters being thrust forward and never actually developed or fleshed out. You can read more about them in the in game bio screens but from a pure storytelling perspective they are basically flat hollow mission givers with no real reason to care about them or Lincoln's straight Shadow of Mordor campaign or even Lincoln himself! I personally couldn't tell you a damn thing about any of the characters I met during my 5/6 hours with the game and that's a real shame.  rinse and repeat missions (There's so ♥♥♥♥ING MANY of these they got boring and repetitive extremely quickly), often recycling the same layouts and environments for different ""missions"" even enemy placements have very little variation,  crap controls (mouse acceleration with no off switch? c'mon guys that's just lazy/no working key rebind system? ♥♥♥♥ sake),   *FIXED* 30FPS lock out of the box (I know its been said like a million times but it matters),   HOWEVER this now presents the issue pertaining to maintaining a consistent 60fps this game running on my system on high reaches 40fps with the fps locked to 60 NOW i would like to take the time to outline the system that this game is running on:  Intel Core i7 5960X @ 4.5 Ghz 16 GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum at 2400 Mhz 2 EVGA GTX 980 ti's 6GB in SLI (the system req's call for a single 290X or 780 from 2013...) Samsung 850 Evo Pro 1TB All sitting on a ASUS Rampage V Extreme All custom watercooled  this system should eat this game up and spit it the ♥♥♥♥ out 3 times over ESPECIALLY as it runs Witcher 3 on ultra at a solid 60FPS without breaking a sweat, this brings the issue up of just poor optimisation for the PC platform and explains why they didn't put full 60 on from the start. PC was an afterthought, a cliff note, a ""oh ♥♥♥♥ we forgot do that"" moment and thats not right we bought the game same as everyone else treat us with at least a little ♥♥♥♥ing respect you did willfully take our money.   no SLI support,   menu's are a joke, blurry aliased text (if you play at a res higher than 1080p) CLEARLY designed for controllers not a mouse and keyboard (as in it has no mouse input at all apart from in maybe the new game section but still displays the cursor),  if you want to play in 21:9 good luck dealing with all the artifacting that comes with it (lighting bugs, discolouration, interface designs e.g the low health blood that appears only covers a 16:9 space...) including a rave party at the edges of the screen whenever you go indoors (spoiler alert you might have to do that quite a bit),   texture pop in is a MAJOR issue with this game along with a HIDEOUS draw distance that means things get properly rendered when they're 10 ft away (by rendered i of course mean that the textures just pop into existence extremely noticeably)   enemies take 1/2 to a full mag to kill if not shot in the head and even then its not a sure thing (the ♥♥♥♥ am I fighting luke cage? I was playing the game on medium btw mother ♥♥♥♥ers take 7 shots in the chest and keep walking)  the police system that was in mafia 2 has been stripped down to cops shoot on sight if you run a red light (what happened to the fine/arrest/shoot/wanted system?)  cover system works well if not a little temperamental on occasion  shooting felt fine but i found myself constantly running out of ammo due to the aforementioned Luke Cage esque enemies  sneak felt like beating up on quadriplegic kids because the AI is legit totally incapable of seeing you crouched in front of them  driving is either PEDAL TO THE METAL or FULL STOP there is no in between and you'll spend most of your time wrestling for control of the car (the game then has the cheek to offer you ""simulation driving"" to make is harder... what were they thinking...)  the standard formula of go here kill this was a common theme... wait ... the only theme that ran though this game and the story only gave context (sometimes it's really paper thin) as to why you are doing what your doing  the game also has these kind-of not cutscenes but cutscenes where you and the person you're meeting with stand awkwardly and wooden with dialogue playing overtop it (this happens WAY more than it should) normally preceeding you going to a place and shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of it like 90% of the other missions that Clay will be undertaking  lastly the options menu is a disaster the graphics settings seem to do nothing to the look of the game having swapped from high to low and low to high the only real difference I could see was the ambient occlusion was missing on the low preset but texture difference is basically non existant (Im starting to think that low and high are the same thing in the config file)  huge disappointment was a game that i was really looking forward to... :(  UPDATE: Steam won't refund me my money so i guess it's only fair that IF (< big if) any of this ♥♥♥♥ gets fixed i will update this review accordingly"
138356843,english,0,360430,"Gameplay wise this game is literally just 35+ hours of doing the same exact thing over and over again. Story wise, it’s decent but just doesn’t feel like a Mafia game, it feels more like a spin-off."
25900757,english,0,360430,"This game isnt exactly a game of the year in my opinion, but ill make a list below of positives and negatives. Remember, these are only my opinions.  [h1]Positive[/h1] [list]     [*]Story seems quite interesting     [*]Gunplay is really fun     [*]Map seems okay     [*]I really like the trash talk of AI     [*]Some animations are really good, almost amazing.     [*]Being able to drive up with a pink beetle, murder enemy enforcer then driving away with pink beetle while they are shootin at you. [/list]  [h1]Negative[/h1] [list]     [*]Driving feels like you are driving on ice and all cars feel like supercars     [*]I really hate games nowdays that make the game challenging by making enemies bullet sponges.  Once I shot one guy 4 times in the upperbody and he didnt die...     [*]Lack of customization. Remember when you could buy clothing in Mafia II? Or customize your car? Well not anymore. You can upgrade your car's performance and thats about it.     [*]Icons floating and showing where weapons, cash and every other collectible things are.     [*] It is really easy. Havent died once yet.. When you are close to dying just run behind cover or pump some adrenaline into you and you are good to go.     [*]Car damage models are horrible.     [*]Cars sound like beefed vacuumcleaners.     [*]Lincoln having that stupid superpower that is plaguing every game nowdays. Seeing trough walls and enemies glowing bright red.      [*]Lincoln doesnt have any animations or ragdoll when he is hit by a car. If a car hits you, you will slide with the car untill you slide off front of the car. [/list] Overall it feels too arcady for me. Only thing that I play it for now is the story. The game itself spoils a lot of the story but I want to see what happens.  I will play it but wont enjoy it as much as Mafia II"
77013818,english,0,360430,"There is not a single reason to call this game ""Mafia"". There are no families, loyalty, fancy clothes, cars or betrayal. There is no proper story, and the game is very repetitive. You go some place, kill everyone, deal damage and kill the boss, thats all. The open world is so dead, AI is very stupid, both the henchman and normal people driving around the city. Car mechanics are very bad, there is no car damage at all. Graphics are bad, blurry. To be honest, this game has the best licenced I've heard for a while, its like they spent all the money for the music, instead of developing the game."
36538437,english,0,360430,"Some pros and cons after few hours in game.  Pros: - Characters, interesting and with deep backstories - Sound is excellent - Location has so much to offer - Open world without loading screens - Interesting gameplay mechanics - Inspired by the blaxploitation movies for sure  Cons: - Boring AF - Bugs everywhere - It's not a MAFIA story, it's just a ""generic revenge story"" with mobs - territories and mafia wars are a simple copy-paste from The Godfather 2 game - You can't collect cars, or houses or clothes but the game wants you to become the richest gangster in the USA - 'whistle', ""who's there?"", kill the guy in stealth mode, go on with other 5000 henchmen  It's not a full no no, it's a ""meh, what a wasted opportunity"""
64130379,english,0,360430,"The first 2 hours in this game is amazing, it feels like it could win the GOTY title because of its masterful storytelling and character shaping, I enjoyed it very much and felt like I was watching a nice movie.  But the game got the mixed reviews for a reason. It quickly becomes repetitive after you're allowed to free roam in the city. Literally every mission you do is to go to a spot to kill & interrogate certain targets and then receive further information and go to the next spot doing the exact same thing until you finally liberate all the districts for your 3 underbosses which is pretty much everything this game has to offer, it really feels like a chore to do and many people hate it because of that.   But the game starts to get a little bit more interesting again after I liberated the first 3 districts. At least now there are races I can do and I get to modify my cars, it's fun because the driving (and the shooting) in this game feels pretty good. But srsly I dunno what they were thinking, the races are not available at first, you have to grind through the first 10+ hours of the game in order to be able to race. I believe the majority of the players just quit before they even know there are races in the game.  Overall I think this game could've been so much better, the demo back in 2015 looks so good that it's hard not to be sold on the game, I dunno what happened later that could make the game so different from what it looked like in the demo, maybe the lack of money? It's such a shame."

Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales.  This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me."
26251295,english,0,360430,"horrible fucking game, a system of ""go kill this dude, ta da!"" in a storyline that boils down to a ""one man army takes over da mafia woo!!!!!""  nothing to do with the original 2 mafia games (which are MUCH better, don't think they're as bad as this), nor the same charm, gameplay, or anything good about them.

30142742,english,0,360430,"I played this game prepared for it to be the worst game ever, so that I wouldn't be disappointed, yet I was pleasantly surprised by the beginning. It had an actual story, interesting characters, it was even funny at times, and I couldn't understand why the rating was so low. But then the prologue ended, and shit hit the ceiling. You suddenly have to do the exact same thing over and over again. Go there, kill this guy, move over there, kill this guy... over and over and over and over and over again. It's like the definition of insanity, and it's a pity, because the prologue was really promising. Still, the game has its moments (if you can survive the repetitive boredom), great characters and voice acting, and an awesome soundtrack (though even that starts to piss you off after a couple of hours listening to the same song). I'd rather not say anything about the graphics."

It's so sad to see a Mafia game end up a disappointment like this since this game had a lot of potential and could've been so much more. I would not recommend this game at full price, it's a joke to pay 60 bucks for such a repetitive and boring gameplay that will keep you entertained for 2-3 hours at the most.

83600002,english,0,360430,"Mafia III: Definitive Edition is an action-adventure open-world game. You are Lincoln Clay, a former criminal and Vietnam veteran. You are forced to return to a life of crime to help your family settle problems with the local Mafia family. It does not take long and the Mafia betray and murder your family, so you are going on a quest for revenge. Over time Lincoln is slowly building a criminal empire.  On its release Mafia III was full of bugs, over time it was patched and was good in terms of performance but then came the Definitve Edition upgrade... Now the game is riddled with graphical bugs, sound bugs (ALT+TAB removed the sounds for me), cut scenes are sometimes not working, some characters which should have opened a door for me to proceed stucked and I had to reload the checkpoint, and the performance overall is worse compared to the former version. The graphics are good. The music is also good and fits to the time, however there could be more songs in the radio (you can listen to radio channels, like in GTA). The characters and the story are uninteresting from my point of view. It does not feel like playing in the Mafia world. The game (especially in the later part) is pretty boring and annoying. The missions are totally repetetive (interrogate a person, destroy that and that and kill a special guy...repeat). So, I actually wished that the game was shorter, as it was a torture to do the same stuff again and again. Mafia III: Definitive Edition is a disapointment. I recommend Mafia II or GTA series, but this game is not worth 29,99 € at all.

149999173,english,0,360430,"A Funny Story   The place named New Bordeaux in the game is Saint Denis in Red Dead Redemption 2, and this is one of the reasons why RDR2 was postponed. The name of the city in the game was originally going to be New Bordeaux, but they changed it to Saint Denis.  Because the name of this city name was already used in Mafia 3 and since Rockstar did not want to use this name, they decided to completely change the name of the city.  Some of the new additions are nice, but overdoing it and straying from the main path of the series must have killed the game, and also the optimization is still a disgrace.  But unfortunately, since there are some small good details, I can never praise such a game because this game is completely a hideout cleaning simulator and it makes you repeat the same thing over and over, it is literally a disgrace and very boring."
55049510,english,1,360430,"I really enjoyed Mafia 3, and this is coming from someone that has also played Mafia 2. There seems to be a lot of criticism towards this game, which is a shame because it's honestly not terrible. The gameplay is repetitive, sure. Plenty of features appear under-cooked and the world could've used some more activities. But these things really didn't bother me - for everything Mafia 3 does wrong, it makes up for it with a stellar soundtrack, vibrant setting, good characters and overall decent storytelling. It's not on Mafia 2 levels by any means, but it isn't nearly as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. I thought Lincoln was a fine protagonist, he suits the ""revenge story"" avenger-role well - and has some of the most memorable appearances in cutscenes.  Speaking of cutscenes, they're beautifully directed and could almost stand on their own as a short film series of sorts. Each set-piece is brutal and memorable. The documentary bits with Father James were great, as were Lincoln's meetings with Donovan. Plenty of cinematic symbolism and great camera angles interspursed with historical imagery. Sure, they're pre-rendered CGI, but I still loved them regardless. M3's motion capture is excellent too, adding to the emotional impact in cutscenes.  If you're going to get this game for one reason, get it for the side content, which is where M3 is at its best I think. It has an original score, which is excellent, and a varied radio selection with plenty of iconic artists from the period ranging from blues, soul, country, and psychedelic/garage rock. I also really enjoyed the collectibles, they evoke Mafia 3's setting well and are fun to read through. The inclusion of character bios was also appreciated; the amount of written content in M3 is honestly immense. Smaller content like the handwritten notes you'd find in racket hideouts also really added to the atmosphere. Lincoln's journal gives you a further insight into his experiences throughout the plot.  Speaking of rackets, I actually really enjoyed this mechanic. As you progress through the story and take over districts, it actually feels like you're tearing away at a rival criminal enterprise and are taking over from the inside. The racket missions are nothing to write home about, but still provide a way to make extra money after the main story. Each safehouse is detailed and distinctive, and populated with NPCs, providing a place to bunker down if you're being pursued by the police and supplying you with extra adrenaline shots and body armor. Cash also serves a purpose in gameplay, and you'll want to store it in your safe as soon as possible. If you die without depositing your cash, you will lose some of it. This ensures you aren't careless with your supplies and gives a sense of urgency. It's best to deposit all of your cash before tackling some of the more difficult enemy safehouses.  I also thought the ""marker"" and services system was great because it means you have a reason to complete side missions for each underboss and remain loyal. You'll want to complete these early in the game and save up your service markers, because you will certainly be needing them - like the ability to halt police pursuits, hijack the phone lines so witnesses can't call for the police, and call for hitmen to aid you in combat. Each racket has a clear and defined difficulty curve as you progress through the story - I never once had to adjust the difficulty setting, which I've had to deal with in plenty of other games with ""artificial"" rises in difficulty where it starts to feel cheap. This was never an issue for me in M3.  [h1]TL;DR - Recommended,[/h1] get this game (perhaps on a sale though). I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it, despite its flaws."
25930497,english,1,360430,"Game is 30fps, yes but one of the smoothest 30fps i've experienced in a PC game. The open world is as basic as it gets, but who is here for the open world aspect really? The combat is the games best feature and its pretty satisfying compare to other open world game. The gunplay is already better than your GTAV gunplay. Theres complaints about the enemies A.I, which ive experienced some dumb moments. Enemies all reacting the same and make the same bad decisions, even breaking aggressive approaches in combat while in a gun fight, to go into stealth A.I animation with my character right in front of clear view.   Honestly the game feels like a early access game. I found out that the devs will be adding the option to change characters clothes after the game launch? sign of a rushed game? I've so far small glitches. The graphics are hit and miss, but its decent.   The story is top-notch.   As much as i want my 60fps, i can't deny that this game isnt fully playable. i've had similar bad experience with batman arkham knights and even witcher 3 at launch. The experience for these games got better as the patches rolled in, so i expect the same for this.   The game is pretty playable and worth owning, be it now or later. Its just going to take some patch work, as with many games on the pc, to reach full potential.  PS: I think the devs made some pretty bad mistake with this game. I wish i could of lend some ideas for the game. game has lost potential."
91458320,english,0,360430,"The game was fine before they added the 2K launcher. Now when you click to start game, you get a launcher than supposedly contacts 2K servers, and checks something (no permission from the user requested).  So you click to get launcher, click to start game, wonder about what the launcher (which wasn't necessary before) is doing in the background, and then click to exit game, and exit the launcher.  At what point did the devs in that company sit around a table and decide that this was what the game needed? I'd recommend their company gets some serious devs. The type that slim down the crap and maximise the gaming experience.  Uninstalled. Shame. Bought it a few months ago, and the game was largely fine, if occasionally buggy. If this is them sorting it, the code must have been seriously messed up, and the new devs were even more useless.

Now it's a bunch of go and kill or interrogate ""Jerry"" with no purpose behind it. This game had a great start and it feels unfinished and rushed to be honest. Go spend your money elsewhere."

146275927,english,0,360430,"[list]     [*]Full of bugs. Not just funny little ones, some are really ruining the experience.     [*]Incredibly repetitive gameplay     [*]Needlessly difficult achievements, since certain counters reset at every restart of the game     [*]Missing details that were present in Mafia I and II, which made the game much more immersive (e.g. police chasing you if you drive too fast) [/list] I think I could go on a bit longer.  And the worst of it, all of these issues appear to have already been present in the original Mafia III game, and nobody bothered to fix any of it in the Definitive Edition.  The idea of the game is not bad in terms of its story, but the way this game is designed is just incredibly boring and annoying. Huge downgrade from the 2 previous games if you ask me. It hurts to say it, since I really liked the Mafia series so far, but I just can't recommend this game to anyone."
70437460,english,0,360430,"The game itself is good, but tedious. Drive, talk to somebody, drive to the place they asked and shoot they guy they asked, then repeat. Also, the PC port is horrendous. Will the game randomly change resolution? Will it freeze and crash on startup? You never know, and neither does the game."
101094548,english,1,360430,"Having played the other Mafia games, I personally really enjoy this one. Is it my favourite? Not necessarily. However, I really loved the story and I found myself very attached to the characters. I found that they were all pretty unique, and I was thoroughly pleased to see Vito make an appearance. I will someday replay the game to see how it plays out with the other characters being in charge, but for now I'm satisfied.  I understand the frustration behind doing virtually the same task for each district, which is killing mob bosses and or interrogating them, destroying rackets, etc. At one point it was annoying but I did realise that it did have a significance to the story of the game, to some extent. They could've made that part more interesting, maybe have some unique scenarios for the different districts, and they could've also used different player models! I found it strange that the same henchmen that I killed were suddenly revived and working for the racket I just secured... strange. With the definitive edition I found that there were a few graphical glitches that took away from the immersion of driving aesthetically pleasing muscle cars whilst listening to 60s rock. Some cut scenes occasionally caused the game to freeze, which became a nuisance at times.  I would still recommend this to someone who hasn't played it, and I agree that it isn't for everyone, but I really like the liberty of completing different missions instead of only doing the main story, and just senselessly killing racists in freeroam. It definitely doesn't follow the traditional Mafia game progression but I can still appreciate the length of the story. If you're looking for something that resembles the previous Mafia games you may be disappointed. I think it's still worth a try, especially at its discounted price."

26027640,english,0,360430,"I've played through the game twice, A majority of my playing time is offline thus my hours aren't reflecting actual time in-game.  Good game but still feels as though we're being guided along the rails. This feels like a step back from Mafia 2. No clothes shops, no car workshops, no gas stations. Graphics were pretty blah out of the box, but after the patch that unlocked FPS and a ReShade preset, the game looks pretty good on a 1070 GTX. It ran consistently, based on the Steam overlay, at 56-57 FPS.  Pros:  -Little details - reactions to PC, witnesses calling in crimes, etc. The city feels alive.  -Environmental/Weather system (people use umbrellas when it's raining, streets get wet when it rains, and they gradually dry after rains)  -Story is very good  -Voice acting is exceptional  Cons:  -Weather system - sometimes it rained for days at a time, and weather changed far too abruptly at times.   -Side missions to increase racket income are repetitive and tedious. This is where a lot of time in the game will be spent as objectives are clear on the other side of the map from you.  -Enemy and Police AI needs some serious attention. Enemies were completely inept unless it was a scripted event. As far as police: No speeding tickets, I could ram into cars all day in front of police but if I accidentally bumped a civilian a 5 state all points bulletin happened.   -Motorist AI is horrendous. I experienced huge traffic jams in some areas of the city which made some missions impossible to complete.  -Buggy:  Had dual Cassandras and Burkes when I did the last of their personal missions, boats spawing on land, cars I needed to steal blowing up for no apparent reason before I could get to them. Disappearing icons - being told to go talk to so and so (while doing racket earning missions) and not being able to as the icons didn't appear on the map. My ""GPS"" path displayed would bug out occasionally turning into some super wide path that was impossible to follow, and many more.  -Unless you're a completionist, there's zero replay value. As stated above, racket earnings missions are extremely tedious and that alone is reason for me not to want to touch this game again.  -Locations get reused. ""Hey kill a pimp here.."" 30 minutes later, hey the boss is so dumb he went back to the same location the pimp was at. Kill him there."" With so many locations possible, this is just pure laziness.  -Different endings but really doesn't feel like it means much, because there's nothing after the little ending spiels. What happened to ""open world games"" letting the player continue playing after the main story is finished? This game could be so much more..  -DLC: First DLC, through free, offered outfits that should have shipped with the game.  tl;dr Good game if you're a ""one and done"" player. If you're looking for replay value I'd wait and see what future patches and/or DLC offer. As of now I can't recommend the game. It's buggy, should have never shipped with a 30 fps lock for PC players, and feels more hollow than it's predecessor.   *review edited to reflect release of first DLC*"
69697800,english,0,360430,"Was really digging this game and made it about halfway through. Then the latest update happened for the Definitive Edition. Now the game is unplayable. Choppy, laggy, no textures, etc. It says my computer doesn't have the specs to run it, even though there was never a single problem in the entire 32 hours I played before the update. Don't buy this game unless they fix it and make it playable again. Would appreciate a response from the developer/publisher, because a lot of people are having the exact same problems I am."
25964231,english,1,360430,"I did enjoy the game but I have to admit it is a huge letdown. If this ever goes on sale, you should definitely buy it.  [h1]The good parts[/h1] - The story is interesting with a unique way of telling it - Gameplay has really improved over Mafia II - Cutscenes and animations are top notch - Soundtrack is awesome - World design is great, all the artists did a really good job on this - Graphics can look amazing at some times  [h1]The not so good parts[/h1] - AI is dumb, even on hardest difficulty you will find the game easy - Driving is easier than in Mafia II but it is a lot more awkward (even in the simulation mode) - Missions do get repetitive but not as much as people say - Open world aspect of the game is still lacking, there are still no things to do apart from main story and 3 generic side missions - Graphics can also look like PS2 game some times - Glitches and crashes do happen but will probably be fixed in the future  [h1]The only reason I recommend this game is because I did enjoy all 30+hrs on my first playthrough. The game is not bad at all, it just isn't as good as it could have been.[/h1]"
97149182,english,0,360430,"Fix for launcher issue:  Under steam right click on the game and go to Mafia 3 > Properties In the launch options at the bottom of the window, add the following command ensuring the location is correct:  ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mafia III\Mafia3DefinitiveEdition.exe"" %command%  Keep the quotations etc. just copy and paste so the exe file launches with %command% and it works. I'll keep my review as it was, below and update if/when I complete the game (assuming no other hitches)  I was enjoying the game, it looks great, story is good and it's an enjoyable setting, although gameplay loop is a little repetitive.  After 5 hours of play time, I cannot get past the launcher. Steam says its running, 2k launcher opens, but when I click on play it shows its running, and within seconds it stops and nothing loads. After a quick search, it seems like this is a common problem and reinstalling visual c++ redistributable didnt fix it, so I guess i'm done with the game. Shame as I was looking forward to finishing it and until now I had looked past the negative reviews and was enjoying it.   Basically, dont waste your time with it: ssems 2k have had this problem for some time and still have not resolved it so I dont hold hope that they will do now (Aug 2021)."
177702181,english,0,360430,"Good story, beautiful game. But, it has too many annoying bugs and glitches even years after released. I had to repeat some missions due to story not continuing certain points especially when chasing Greco with Vito, stupid cars also got destroyed too fast. The mission design is also repetitive that you better use a mod to reduce those tasks. Also, no fast travel in this open world, especially when I want to get back to the herb house for money. Finally, it really needs a manual save to load when you make mistakes or something. It could've been great, but 2K and Hangar 13 fcked it up with their laziness to fix it. The negative reviews are well deserved."
92753278,english,0,360430,"I first bought this game about 1.5 year ago, back when it was still just your regular Mafia 3 and not the illustrious Mafia 3: Definitive Edition. I actually liked it more than most - yeah, it was repetitive and some of the design choices I found just baffling, but still... it was fun enough to keep me going. Until, that is, I ran into a vicious little gamebreaking bug that caused my game to freeze on an infinite loadscreen.   Got frustrated, got over it, uninstalled the game, thinking I might give it another shot should they ever patch it up.   So, yeah, it's been a year and a half. Did they fix it?  Nope.   Real fuckin' definitve, guys."
134945692,english,0,360430,"One of the rare times where I wish Steam had a neutral recommendation. I think the story is a great idea on paper and the actual cutscenes, radio tunes and voice acting is pretty good. I love the idea of a mob revenge story set during the civil rights era where you play as a guy taking back his city, racket by racket, to avenge those close to him who were killed by the Italian mafia. It's way different than the first two games in tone, now you have more than just an opposing mob and the police force after you, you have actual racist, hate groups, Haitians and corrupt politicians as well. It feels serious, yet I cannot say the gameplay does the story and tone justice. Like everyone has said at this point, it is REPETITIVE. The majority of these missions play out exactly like this: drive to a district to talk to an NPC about a nearby racket that an enemy has conjured up, go to the same three mission types in the district and complete them till the game says you caused enough damage in funds to that racket, then go back to that same NPC and they will give you the exact location of the person who ran that racket, then go back to one of the mission areas you already completed and kill that guy, you take control over the racket, mission completed. Do that about fifteen or so times to take over the entire county and maybe you'll get a fun mission or two. There is optional missions, but these play out the same way, deliver this vehicle and kill this guy, literally all of them! And the thing is, the actual shooting and driving is fine, but it's just so boring seeing the same death animations, the same buildings, the same enemies over and over! Don't get me wrong, there is fun to be had, these repetitive missions weren't boring at first. It was just when I realized after a few hours of taking over rackets, that was almost the entire game! I wanted variety just like the first two games had. There was driving missions, sneaking missions, missions where you had to exclusively go in guns blazing and maybe a few that combined these elements in one big mission. I will also admit that these games didn't go out on the open world aspect, but it was for the better, because look at Mafia 3's version. I would be surprised if anyone actually liked this one over the previous two games. The actual story missions are decent, they have great cutscenes and I love the interactions between characters. Actually going inside a different building or area was a breath of fresh air. It was awesome seeing Vito again and working alongside him throughout the game. The problem is, they come way too far in between the racketeering junk. A big smack in the face? The DLCs have better mission designs! ""Faster, Baby!"" is the best one because you can destroy an entire county with this bada** vehicle and create your own weed strains, it's cool and the story for it is action packed all the way. Final thoughts: Mafia 3 is a disappointment and basically junk food. It's every mediocre open world game, Frankenstein stitched together with an interesting story and a 60's setting."
182893924,english,0,360430,"Mafia III is a game where you go from point A to point B to shoot a lot of guys before going back to point A to talk to a person to go shoot some more guys, usually ending in a mildly interesting set piece mission.  It's been done a thousand times before, and it's not what people come to play the Mafia series for."
161988765,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 has both positive and negative aspects. A game that everyone had great hopes for.  ✅Soundtrack - the music is perfectly matched to the game, which takes place in 1968, ✅the story of the main character - memorable, allowing you to feel the role of a person who only wants revenge, ✅supporting characters - their presentation and manner of being in the game add an interesting atmosphere, ✅ prologue and story missions - a very interesting and engaging prologue that allows you to feel the atmosphere and story missions done at a very high level, ✅shooting system - we have pistols, rifles, snipers, shotguns and several unique weapons at our disposal. Perfect refinement of shotgun shooting, you can feel that you have a strong weapon.   ➖side missions - repetitive, interesting at the beginning, but after a few hours of gameplay boring and tiring, ➖ damage to vehicles - after hitting another vehicle at high speed, there is not much damage, but after hitting bushes or a fire hydrant, our vehicle is no longer suitable for driving, ➖NPCs - we are often lost by enemies, fighting them in some locations is very simple, there is no challenge at all, ➖police - I miss tickets for speeding or road collisions, the police in Mafi 3 are practically useless."
166578693,english,0,360430,"Honestly it's more of a meh for me. The story is interesting and funny, but is overshadowed by the repetitive game-play, go here kill this guy, than go kill these group of guys and get a main mission about killing this main guy. That is the entire game-play cycle, start to finish. The endings are honestly lackluster, and leave a lot to be desired.   I would recommend you pick it up in sale, third party, or at least buy the trilogy which would net you more bang for your buck. A cool concept and great story weighed down by horrible game-play."
92491256,english,1,360430,This game is good game with good and bad points I want say bad points in first place and explain how much this game is underrated Bad points are  1)fps drops and few bugs(i didnt see any crashes in my exprience) 2) repetitive missions if u want just finish story in fastest time(just play dlcs and side missions beside main missions till dont tired from main missions) 3)poor graphic and textures Good points: 1)amazing story and characters with great acting that u cant forget them for long time 2)musics 3)driving system 4)ending missions and enjoyable dlcs 5)variety of weapons and ways u can finish missions I cant understand this much of hating for this great game.i think 8/10 can be good score for this game
163197022,english,1,360430,"Ignore the hate about this game, It's actually all-around GREAT. To me it's definitely a #Top10 Revenge-driven story I have ever played. It has a very compelling story line with very creative cinematics and crucial choices to be made that dictate the ending. The cars, the driving and combat physics, the in game music? - Almost Perfect. Including the DLCs this game is a FUN TIME above everything else, enthusing, controversial and brutal, anyone who says otherwise is a liar. - 10/10"
122396465,english,0,360430,"I finally managed to play this game, and finish it as well. Although I must admit I had fun playing it, I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone who does not know the Mafia game lore. If you have not played the previous games, this game is not for you, and if you played them, the ocassional nostalgia is what keeps you going. What I mean by that are the following positives of this game: + The story of the game is interesting, the protagonist is very well picked and introduced.  + You meet Vito Scaletta, the protagonist of Mafia 2, and if you're lucky, you might meet more Mafia 2 characters + Since I played the Definitive edition I had access to all DLCs which were interesting both story and content-wise +Stealth in this game is amazing, whether it's the silencer or takedowns, also throwing knives as dlc content were an awesome addition + The soundtrack is very good. I think that this pretty much sums up the positive aspects of the game for me personally, so let's move on to the negatives:  - As soon as I started the game, I had to try multiple options in the settings for the game to be playable. This game has been released long enough, there should've been some kind of a patch already to fix this, because playing on lowest settings is really hard to look at an unable to play with. - The game crashed rarely, but it crashed indeed.  - GPS has a mind of its own. If the mission allows multiple targets as a choice and I pick the closest one, I expect the gps to stay focused on that point without changing it to a further one. Why should I go from Point Verdun all the way to the Bayou if what I'm looking for can also be found in Point Verdun?  - More customization options, but worse customization options.  - The game is very much repetitive. If I didn't have the DLCs to change it up a bit, I would get bored much easier and quicker, which I eventually did after I finished the DLCs.   This game is actually not that bad, it has a hidden potential, but it also has many many things that need to be fixed. It is playable, it is mildly enjoyable, but it is mostly repetitive and unstable."
165231026,english,1,360430,"I get why people like it less than the other Mafia games, as it's very dissimilar. It's more of a Grand Theft Auto than anything else. The mission are repetitive indeed, and the enemy NPC's are basically walking practice dummies, but it is what it is - 50+ hours of casual fun. Loved the setting, rarely have I seen a city so well reproduced. The story itself, the diverse cast of side characters and backgrounds, and the music, were all excellent. I loved it, might not be everyone's cup of tea but I've enjoyed it just as much as I've enjoyed GTA games back in the day."
79765478,english,1,360430,"It plays like it came out in 2009 vs. 2016, but I'd recommend a play through anyway.  You have 2 choices of play style: Sneak or shoot em' out. If you sneak, there is a huge flaw in game mechanics. Each enemy will ""search"" for you and follow the exact same path the last one did allowing you to essentially stand there and knife them one by one until the whole place is empty. Boring, right? If you don't stand there, the enemies are still on this one path of searching and it just messes the game up. I suggest just shooting em. Go in with guns for the most part.   Story is great and the cut scenes don't drag out, however, it does become a sort of grind after several hours. Reminds me of GTA - drive over here, kill this person, drive back. Drive here.. etc etc.   Still recommend on sale as a time-consuming open world game."
118420123,english,0,360430,"I actually like this game but I can't recommend because it is very poorly optimized for PC and runs like garbage. The story is decent and the game play is ok but does get highly repetitive. Play this one on console if you have to, it's a much better experience"
25911615,english,0,360430,"Updated: This is not an acceptable game for 2016. The amount of glitches, repetitiveness, and lack of other missions, and jobs to do after you complete the story is poor. Mafia 3 tried hard to bring back the Mafia series, but it crashed and burned. I had so much hope for this game, but it turned out to be another No Man's Sky of 2016.  Original Post Below: This great video by CrowbCat shows the many things wrong with Mafia III PC version. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  This is what happens when you give a good game series to a different developer who has no idea on how to make proper video games. I had so high hopes for this game, but I was let down once again by the gaming industry.  This game is so awful. When I decided to play on PC, it was because I have a choice. I could choose my hardware, my software, my resolution, my framerate, and my graphics, but what Hangar 13 did is unacceptable. They locked the game to 30FPS, and their reason for that is: ""The team has been hard at work ensuring that Mafia III’s performance is consistent across all platforms, and right now the game runs at a solid 30 frames-per-second.""   That's the most bullshit I have ever heard in one sentence. Mafia III for PC is a console port. The game has so many problems when it comes to reflections, lighting, and no SLI support. The antialiasing just blurs the game to make the edges look better, the PC controls are horrendous, and the game is being upscaled from 720p. It's so damn hard to focus on the story aspect when the screen is tearing, the graphics are glitching out, things pop in at ridiculous distance, but wait, they are releasing a patch to make the game run over 60FPS, and fix the issues. Too late, you already screwed up the game's launch, and what you have done will not be forgotten. They did release the patch to unlock the framerate, but since they never optimized the game good, it still runs like shit. This was my birthday present, and it's the worst fucking birthday present I have ever gotten. Hangar 13 didn't deliver on their promise on putting time, and effort into their PC version. You had 5 fucking years to sort all this shit out, but you didn't. Nice job Hangar 13, you made a sequel to Mafia II worse.  Don't buy this game."
179728001,english,0,360430,"[i]As a first time player.[/i]  Mafia III nails the 1960s vibe with a detailed city and an incredible soundtrack that immerses you in its world. The first few hours are cinematic and gripping, but the excitement quickly fades.  I hate writing reviews without finishing games, but this one is boring af. It doesn’t make you feel like you’re part of the Mafia, instead dragging you into repetitive side quests that block progress to the main story. Cool unlocks, are locked behind tedious grind sessions. And without a fast travel system, getting around the massive city becomes a tedious time sink.  A promising start derailed by frustrating design choices."
182762819,english,0,360430,"Its just rinse and repeat. All the missions are the exact same thing with zero variation. The first few hours were so strong and I bet the story is amazing, but they extended the game 20 too long which is very evident from the idiotic mission design. Its just time wasting. Guess, Ill watch the cutscenes on Youtube as there is no way i'm spending 30 hours or so doing the exact same thing over and over again, Its insane."

148865293,english,0,360430,"A lazy-made game with a few interesting mechanics, but almost everything works with bugs or problems. Optimization, in my opinion, is pretty good, such as graphics.  Positive elements, noted by me:  - ""fatalities"" - lethla\non-lethal, depending on walking\running and weapon in your hands. Looks smooth and brutal. - Some characters are really interesting. - DLC missions are the best ones in the entire game (lol), excluding the prologue. There are more, but they are inconspicuous.  Should say special hate for critical bugs: - Cars' tires can't live longer than 20 seconds in chases. I mean all 4 tires will be broken after 20 seconds of any chase and enemies don't even need to shoot. Can you imagine how it makes impossible any chases? Can't even say how it is ridiculous. - Pedestrians-kamikadze. I think 80% of pedestrians choose the wrong direction to dodge your car and jump right under your tires. Funny? No, because there are cops (see previous bug). And because your car reacts to it inadequately.  Any words about seamless grind are unnecessary. Just avoid it in every possible way (I used cheats). Also, I liked music."

25900160,english,0,360430,"Nevermind the 30 FPS. (Fixed in patch 1.01)  - No saving, only one constantly overwriting checkpoint system. Want to re-play a mission or go for different decision? Well, you better start the game all the way from the start again then. - Contains a ton of incredibly lazy and boring, unskippable cutscenes where Clay talks with one of the minor story characters. All of them shot from exactly same camera angle, which never moves, and neither do the characters. They give no info related to the main story and did I mention they are unskippable. - Hold [DEL] as a default keybind. (Default keybindings have been improved in patch 1.01) - Game fails to detect native screen resolution. Was set 1600 x 900 on my 1920 x 1080 screen. - In-game options can't handle using Steam overlay. Enabling and then disabling Steam overlay while options menu is on closes the option menu, even if you are in middle of making changes. - Rolling menus, yes, you must wait for the menu to roll past Kill list, Assets, Journal tabs to get to Options. - All weapon stats in percentages, including ammo capacity. Freaking love these revolvers with 15% and semi auto pistols with 31% ammo capacity. - Mouse sensitivity settings are a mess. Mouse sensitivity in menus is extremely high, bringing sensitivity down to usable levels in menus brings in-game sensitivity to unusably low. Menu mouse behaviour also suffers from mouse de-acceleration. - The game has a backlighting profile for Logitech RGB keyboards, which only makes things worse. Just three red vertical stripes, does not illuminate keys that are actually bound for gameplay functions. - Lock opening QTE gets repetitive and old really fast. - Looks horrible because everything on screen is softened/blurred so heavily. For example faces at about 20 meter distance are blurred into solid brown blobs. No sharpness anywhere. No combination of graphics settings seems to fix this. - Death and money mechanics. When you die, instead of ""loading last save"" you lose 50% of your money and you continue with whatever ammunition you had when dying. Respawned with 5 ammo on the pistol and 3 on SMG. -> Go buy more ammo before getting back to action. - Camera positions when driving are way too low. There are near, medium and far camera positions, but none of them actually are set high enough to be properly able to see in front of you. This also adds to the bad looking graphics when ground textures are viewed from a flattened angle. - Deadlocked traffic jams that break ""follow that car"" missions. - Badly executed subtitles where long blocks of text are often cut in middle of sentences and the timings are off.   Mafia III manages to implement usability problems I've never even seen before. It is incredible that they have managed to put effort into making things worse from usability point of view.

137642489,english,0,360430,The game is really bad. The district mechanics are very repetitive and thus boring. The game is more reminiscent of a Splinter Cell or Assassins Creed with repetitive tasks. The graphics are not to my taste either. The city is not very original. Everything looks kind of the same and the driving is very arcadey.
70246957,english,1,360430,I really enjoy the game. Have played thru it numerous times. Just started back thru it again.

191119581,english,0,360430,"If there were a ""[b]Neutral[/b]"" option on Steam, I would put this game in that category. Unfortunately, I have to choose between ""[b]Recommended[/b]"" and ""[b]Not Recommended[/b],"" and that's tough because my experience with this game was a mix bag of enjoyment but it also boring me to death.  Mafia 3 is a huge departure from Mafia 1 and 2. Those games had that signature ""Mafia feel"", you were deeply embedded in the mob, experiencing a gripping and linear, story-driven experience that captured the old-school gangster vibe. Mafia 3? Not so much. While you have ties to the mob, you’re not part of it in the same way. Instead, the game shifts gears and leans heavily toward an open-world, GTA-style/Ubisoft formula. This game isn’t inherently bad, but it does cause the game to lose part of what made the Mafia series so unique. The story is really good imo! It’s dark, gritty, and unforgettable! One of the strongest aspects of this game.  Unfortunately, the gameplay is a hufe let down. The missions are painfully repetitive. Taking over districts quickly becomes a chore. You’ll find yourself doing the same types of objectives over and over, and it drags the experience down. Combine that with frequent crashes! I had to restart the game multiple times just to get it running and it can be frustrating.  In the end, [b]Mafia 3 is a good game, but it’s not a good Mafia game[/b]. If you go in expecting something like Mafia 1 or 2, you might be disappointed. But if you give it a chance as its own thing, there’s some enjoyment to be found. Just be prepared for the rough edges."
122590783,english,0,360430,2k Launcher. Hate leaving reviews that don't talk about game but I can no longer play it thanks to launcher. This is my fruitless attempt to give myself some form of relief by punishing them in my small insignificant way.
29925489,english,0,360430,"From pre-release trailers this game looked to be like a more expansive version of the amazing Mafia II, but no.   Pros: +The story, like Mafia II's is very well written. +The facial animations in cutscenes are the only thing the game truly exceeds at.  Cons: -Gameplays is needlessly dull and repetitive. You know UbiSoft towers? That optional ""content"" that was basically padded on to every Ubi open world game from 2012-15? That's this entire game essentially, yet somehow worse. -Speaking of repetitive, you literally go back to the exact same areas and do the exact same things in very short periods of time. -Something about the gunplay feels off and so does the driving. -Even on hard, the enemy AI is useless.  -The lack of content that wasn't there at launch despite being shown in trailers like changeable clothes just highlights how much of an unfinished mess this was. -Despite updates to add new features and slightly improve performance, this game still full of glitches and crashes on a more than capable machine.  -In general, the game looks awful. Its far more bland than the colourful screenshots used in advertisements and the games lighting in infamously abysmal. -Despite the well written story, there is so much padding between key story missions that I'd forget what was happening.    So yeah, this isn't good. Don't buy it. Not even if it's cheap. It's a sub-par bore-fest."
109933836,english,0,360430,"Yet another game where a Mixed review, instead of Recommended/Not Recommended, would be more appropriate.  Where the game shines is its story, cutscenes and voice acting. The first ~2 hours are amazing, with the cutscenes and gameplay elements interwoven to create this incredibly engaging storytelling experience… and then it drops you into the open world, which I will write about a bit later.  The animations within the cutscenes are just incredible. The lip synching, face animations etc. are the best I have seen so far. The textures are incredibly high quality as well. This makes me wish they just focused on the story in a linear fashion like in the previous Mafia games, instead of doing what they ultimately did. Outside of cutscenes the game looks good, though there are some weird looking instances of draw distance behaving erratically, same for glass and mirror reflections.  Story wise it’s engaging, interesting, presented in a pseudo-documentary with interviews with an aged cast of the game. The interview parts are thrown in periodically throughout the duration of the plot, without ever overstaying their welcome, but being frequent enough as not to let the player forget about them.  Main plot missions are fairly original, definitely more appealing than the open world, with some fantastic set pieces. I won’t spoil anything but, again, this proves they should have spent their time on making the game linear.  All of the above constitutes around 20% of the whole game. The remaining 80% is doing open world tasks: 1.	Go to district 2.	Talk with quest giver about taking over an enemy racket 3.	Do $X of damage to the enemy property by stealing money, killing enforcers, or burning assets within the district 4.	Once the $X of damage has been reached, return to the quest giver 5.	Get the mission to kill or recruit the racket owner in a building you most likely have already visited doing the $X of damage part of the mission 6.	Kill or recruit the racket owner Do all of the above 17 more times. Yes, you read that right. Seventeen. 9 districts, 2 rackets for each. No matter how good the combat is, how satisfying, vicious and brutal the takedowns are, how many different approaches you have to some of the tasks, you are essentially doing the same stuff again and again. This literally kills Mafia 3. This is the main reason this game has Mixed reviews here on Steam. I never had any technical issues, but that does not matter, since I have to kill the 25th damn enforcer and burn the 132nd box of assets on my way to kill the 13th racket owner.  Another issue I have is how over the top it is compared to other Mafia games. The protagonist, Lincoln, is a great example of it. Instead of being a regular human being like Tommy or Vito, Lincoln is a Vietnam war veteran seeking vengeance for the deaths of his family, who stands at 6 foot 3 inches and looks like he’s 250 pounds of pure muscle. He is able to run head first into a gun fight, eviscerating enemies with his combat knife left and right. If he gets hurt, he can just jam an adrenaline syringe into his arm and continue his rampage largely unimpeded, unless he encounters guys with shotguns. Lincoln is not a Mafia character, he is literally the Punisher. Why is the Punisher the protagonist of a Mafia game?  The DLCs are on the level of the main plot missions, so they’re good, but each of them is only around 2 hours long. They also are over the top, more like GTA than Mafia.  Ultimately, I cannot recommend it, because if you want to enjoy the story elements, you will require a TON of patience. I know I spent much time on it, but I wanted to know if there is any gameplay variation at any point in the game. There is not."
35854721,english,0,360430,"Not worth the $75.  $20-30 would be more reasonable, although it feels as though the developers were forced to release the game before it was complete.  Being a hardcore fan of the series, especially the second game, I was really expecting something special for the third (and possibly final?) game in the series.   Something about this game reeks of clashes between designers/developers. I feel almost as though there was a group of talented designers and developers with experience working on this game, trying to add quality where they could, but ultimately held back by the poor choices of other designers and developers.  Mafia III runs on an updated version of the engine that powered Mafia II. This feels evident in a subtle way; the dynamics and movement reflect that of the second game in the series.  You play the role of Lincoln Clay, an absolute monster of an ex-soldier who is out for blood at the neck of the most powerful crime boss in the city of New Orleans. Along the way, you build up your own team of lieutenants, complete missions and take over the city region-by-region.  THE GAMEPLAY is good in general, but it is executed and applied poorly. Prior games applied the beautifully crafted experience where you would meet up with fellow gang members and discuss details, work out what your goal was, and then work your way through a set of unique obstacles to each mission such as sneaking into warehouses or following cars to remote locations, sometimes with sabotage from the other team.  In Mafia III, each mission consists of a 'cutscene' in which Lincoln stands in front of some generic random person in the exact same way, and both talk about what you're going to do. Almost every single mission (around 98%) are identical in gameplay, and simply take place at different locations. They usually consist of ""Drive to this gang area, interrogate and/or kill the boss, and trash the place while you're at it. This is the games weakest point, and it becomes repetitive within half an hour of beginning missions as you predict what comes next. The cutscenes are re-used over and over for every single mission, with Lincoln simply standing over an enemy and holding a knife to his throat, then either knocking him out or killing him.  THE ENVIRONMENT of New Orleans is masterfully crafted. I was personally excited to experience the ""French Ward"", based on the French Quarter of New Orleans in reality. Each area is detailed with gorgeous buildings, vivid lights and a whole group of beautifully subtle features that make the world feel 'real'. Walking past houses, you might walk right up to a random front door and hear muffled music inside.  There is one flaw however, there is absolutely nothing to do in New Orleans! You cannot eat at bars, find new clothes, steal from weapons shops, do any kind of interesting activity (bowling, use strip clubs etc).  THE CARS seem to handle pretty much how you'd imagine cars from the 1960s would. Big, boxy designs of the late 60s barrel around corners with horrendous understeering which in itself, actually becomes a fun mechanic; you must navigate your environment carefully.  However, you cannot own your own vehicles in this game like the previous ones. There is no car that is special to you, you must simply steal one, or request a lieutenants man to bring you one of a tiny handful of custom selected cars .  THE WEAPONS have absolutely no guts. Instead of massive revolvers that punch holes in enemies and machine guns that rip things to shreds, each weapon feels like a cap gun shooting bb pellets. The sound design is clear but poorly suited to each weapon, and the gunplay segments are repetitive. Enemies shoot back blindly with no co-ordination or tactics. One thing that did irk me is the inclusion of weapons from the 1980s when the game is allegedly set in 1968.  Something Mafia II did well was allow you a sense of progression in the world. Vito had to work his way up (often for the rug to be yanked back out from under him) and it was apparent through different houses, cars, amounts of money etc. In Mafia III, you actually own no more or less at the end of the game than you do at the start with the exception of territory. There is no acquired sets of clothes, no arsenal of weapons, no garage of cars.  For MAFIA II fans; The game does give a definite, but extremely quick closure to Mafia II, but I would recommend simply searching youtube for 'Mafia III Joe Barbaro' to find out what happened. Vito has changed a fair bit since his time in Empire bay. His way of speaking and his accent are different, now resembling the fast-talking chicago-type gangster rather than the logical Vito once represented in the previous game. He's become extremely aggressive, fast-talking, and seemingly bitter with everything.  + Very authentic New Orleans Environment  + Atmosphere is incredible, can be very beautiful sometimes.  + Incredible Soundtrack  + Interesting lieutenant mechanics, being able to call in favours from others and try to keep everyone happy with owning a piece of the city each is a challenge.  + Driving can actually be quite fun, steering and maneuvering is quite satisfying.  - Story is stretched out and predictable  - Extremely repetitive gameplay  - Poor weaponplay  - Buggy, low framerate from time to time, repeated crashes.  - Inaccurate for the period (ie weapons from the 1980s in a game set in 1968, cars from the 70s in 1968 etc)"

26073749,english,0,360430,"There's not a single good thing that I can say about this game.  The story is supposed to be good but it just isn't! An orphan came back from the war and fights racist criminals who killed his homies. That's it. That their story. I don't know about you, but I didn't expect this lackluster from a Mafia title. And the developers have told the story and shown most of the cutscenes on their YouTube channel anyway. Gameplay is unbelievably repetitive, everything feels the same, like running in circles. Or rather walking very slowly. There's usually just a single animation for each action and it gets very annoying watching it over and over and over and over ... again. Driving cars is not enjoyable in this game and you'll be driving a lot. I was quite disappointed that there's no cockpit view. I mean we've seen it in promo videos how Clay switches the gears and tunes his radio but there's none of that in the game. Also customization options for cars are more limited compared to Mafia II and became available long after the launch. NPCs react unrealistically to hero's actions. I broke into a closed empty club at night and there was just one girl dancing non-stop paying no attention what-so-ever to me until I shot her. Bystanders run straight towards the player to call the police and enemies can't see Clay right in front of them in stealth. Graphics are insultingly bad. Textures are a blurry mess, sky is the worst I've seen in any game. It can turn bright orange in the middle of the night and it changes in such a weird way that you question the state of mind of programmers responsible for that all the time. How did they manage that game looks worse than games from ten years ago is beyond me. Soundtrack which I've already heard in a hundred other Vietnam themed games and movies is great. But it was created half a century ago by people who have nothing to do with Hangar 13. And last but not least. The centerfold girls are the same ones that were in the previous game... It's not that costly to do a new photoshoot of girls in 60s interiors. Overall game feels like a lazy cash grab. I'm very disappointed."

59026047,english,1,360430,"A CRIMINALLY underrated game. I've been playing this game with all the DLC and I gotta say it's has been an amazing experience. I know Mafia 3 is a pretty divisive games amongst fans and regular players, but for me personally? I love it and it's right up my alley.  CONS: 1. Repetitive gameplay loop - Now, I'll clarify this: the gameplay loop never bothered me too much. I loved the combat and driving mechanics, so it never grinded my gears like with other players. I do understand that this can be a breaking point for some folks. 2. BUGS - Now, I played Mafia 3 when all the patches were implemented. Still, I got 2 crashes when finishing a mission and there were some bugs that popped up that really annoyed me. Example: I finished a simple objective in a mission and when a cutscene script was supposed to kick in, I was just standing in place and couldn't move at all. Thankfully, I was able to fix it with ease by loading a checkpoint. Still, stuff like that can be very annoying and can put people out of the experience easily.  PROS: 1. Great story & Excellent Characters - If there is one thing most people can agree on about Mafia 3, it is that the story, writing, and characters are very well done. I actually gave a crap about all the characters and wanted to see where the story was gonna go next. One thing that Mafia 3 does better than most of it's competitors is that it actually has compelling villains with understandable motives - hell, some even have RELATABLE motives. Along with that, the game accomplishes to not absolve them and make them sympathetic. They're still terrible people, but it doesn't mean they're aren't human. Mafia 3's story and characters are definite highlight. 2. Combat - The combat in Mafia 3 is super satisfying. Going in guns blazing or sneaking in like a predator are both options that can be done with no qualms or setbacks. Gun sounds have a satisfying kick and the feedback from enemies in terms of death and injury are very brutal and strong. Headshots have a crispy pop and the general combat mechanics ride a nice line between over-the-top violence and realism. 3. Driving - Now I ain't no NASCAR driver or car expert, but the driving in Mafia 3 is fucking awesome. You really feel the weight of the vehicle you're driving. The sequences where you're chasing someone, or are being chased are butt clenching-ly tense and exciting. The police chases in this game are actually intense! Oh, and the racing is a very neat 4. Mocap and animations - The mocap in Mafia 3 is some of the best I've seen in a while. A definite highlight is Father James, who has one of the most expressive faces in gaming history. When there was actual emotion coming from a character's face, I felt it - down to the individual wrinkles and all. 5. Presentation - Mafia 3's best strength BY FAR is it's interpretation of the 60s during the ending of Vietnam Era and Civil Rights movement. You can feel Vietnam and the racial tensions all over the game. There are moments in the game where key events in that time period are mentioned and even play a small part in the story and gameplay. Hell, the way they tied how the police works with the time period is excellent. If you cause havoc in one of the poorer and predominantly Black districts, police are less likely to respond to your actions. However, if you start shit in the more wealthy districts like Downtown and the French Ward, the police are gonna be on your ass just like that. 6. Soundtrack - The original soundtrack for Mafia 3 has become one of my faves in recent memory, but the real star of the game is the licensed soundtrack. This game makes amazing use of songs like ""Paint it Black"" and ""Just a Little Bit"". It elevates certain scenes and makes them feel ecstatic. 7. DLC - I'm not gonna spoil any of the DLC, but all I'll say is this: BUY THE DELUXE EDITION. The DLC expansions are all great and adds some very much needed variation to the game. It turns the game into a worthy purchase, in my humble opinion.  All in all, I love Mafia 3 and think it's a great sequel to Mafia 2 (Which I also loved). The story, characters, writing, presentation - along with the pretty good combat - sealed the deal for me, personally. However, I do know that it went away with some loved mechanics from previous games and the gameplay loop can be deal-breaker for some players. So what I'll say is that you should definitely wait for this game to be on sale or when it permanently becomes cheap. Buy the deluxe edition to get the full experience with the DLC. Thank you for reading my review."
161384394,english,1,360430,"I couldn't care less about what many people say about this game having repetitive levels or bugs. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this game.

The DLCs were good overall, except for one that was bad.  This game had some weaknesses but it was worth my time.  Mafia 1 and 2 might be better, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of this one. 8/10"

132170021,english,0,360430,"It feels harsh to post a negative review after 244 (alleged) hours playing and enjoying it at times. Underneath the janky graphical style is a SOLID ""conquer  the territory"" game that has great missions, good visuals, a well-developed city, a big map, constantly lots to do. Or there would be if the game would just get out of its own way.  Probably the hands-down W.O.R.S.T. port of a console game to PC that I have ever played. Transitions, such as cut-scenes, seem to crash the game pretty regularly, even after all the years of patches.  The map seems open world, but really, it's not. The freedom to face enemies your own way is seriously limited by a top-down 2D design for the tactical map (what you move around in) that says, ""No, you may not climb those rocks to get cover"", ""No, you may not go through some bushes, that's a boundary"", ""No, you may not smash that window and get cover inside that building, use a door like normal people!"" and so on.  It's pretty clear this game was developed to a seriously limited budget. Which is a shame, because the developers had some serious chops, some solid ideas are in it, they've had to cut corners, but they've tried to bring their vision to bear. But, in the end, those limitations lead us to a game that feels very much like Mafia 1 design/graphics/limitations, a game from 2002, in a 2017 game.  So, it's a sad emoji ""No"" vote from me. I think if you can bear with the crap, play it -- I still try to -- but just go in eyes-open: knowing what you're getting yourself into."

CONS: - Pretty much everything else. (Story. Missions. AI. Repetitiveness of game mechanics. You name it.)  Let me be perfectly clear. It's NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game. Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were. You simply can't remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it. Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get. There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities.  Result: Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team  do it properly. Unfortunately, Hangar 13 doesn't seem to have a clue about what original Mafia games really were about. If you really like America's 60s its worth a shot, though."

The base gameplay is enjoyable but feels off from time to time. definitely not the most refined shooting in an open world game that I've played.

140943024,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 got a bit of a bad rap when it was released, and (at the time of writing) still has 'Mixed' reviews.   This is a little unfair, while the criticisms levelled at the game at launch (buggy, samey combat, poor performance) may be true to some degree, the Definitive edition, with all the extra DLC it brings, means that the game is rarely boring.  Mechanically, the game is much like any other GTA-clone - more open world than Mafia 2 (and much more than the original), but still without an excess of side missions (indeed most combat encounters are either story missions, or in order to unlock the next story mission).  The game has a clearly defined story, but each region of the city must be 'worked' to force the capo of the region to come into the open.  That is typically achieved by finding and disrupting the street level crimes in the racket (the gun runners, the drug dealers etc.) and interrogating low level enforcers until you have forced the head of the racket into the open.  Dispose of both rackets in a region, and the capo is exposed for a mission. The missions themselves are often great, some intelligent set-pieces, and pretty good gun-play.  The grind work however is a little more boring (hence the initial complaints).  All the mechanics are fine, it's just annoying going around the city's whorehouses to gun down pimps, only to be sent back to one of those same whorehouses to dispose of the racket boss.  Fortunately, those locations are great, and no two regions share the same rackets (though there are similarities of course), and the formal game missions are top notch.   The game actually starts with a stand-out mission - a bank robbery gone wrong, which climaxes in a boat race under the city to the thundering theme of 'Born to be wild'.   However, the games first mis-step for me, was at the end of this escape, as we ploughed the boat up and over a ramp the camera pulled away and I roared 'Born to be Wi-i-i-ild'... The game did not however force the climax of the music here (whether by accident or by design).  It's a silly thing, and yet rather than an epic (if cliché) end to the chase, instead the main flow of the song continued and i felt deflated.   The game never again manages to blend the music and stylings so well, and since i heard the song multiple times in the future, maybe it was purely coincidence, but what an opportunity was missed.  The soundtrack overall is great, there's some obvious classics missing, but the period accurate music selection is wide enough, and good enough, that it is highly reminiscent of GTA Vice City before they started dicking around to avoid renewing the licensing - I fear that when Mafia 3 inevitably gets the same treatment, it will steal much of the games charm (but fortunately that is not true yet).  The remaining sound design, particularly voice acting, is excellent, and really sets the tone for the 70's in the deep south of America.  Racism is on display nearly everywhere through the game (though oddly not too much from pedestrians), and is obviously a central tenet of the story and dialogue, but it's played well, enough to make you uncomfortable, and remain sympathetic to the protagonist.  Mafia 3 stands out from others in the genre, by making you give the regions you liberate to allies, who in turn grant bonuses to you - a gunshop, extra health, someone to collect money from you (when you die, you respawn at a safe house but lose half the cash you have in your pocket - so this is a huge perk) etc.   There's also 2 distinct car upgrade routes.   Firstly, for completing side missions for your allies, and secondly at the garage.    The game explains this terribly, but the garage upgrades are purely cosmetic and utterly pointless, while the ones from your allies are worthwhile.  There is a racing series (which i suspect is from a DLC) which this becomes critical for, but these upgrades can also be useful for just generally getting around the city.  The city itself is a wonderful place, a huge bayou area, and then 7 or 8 distinct city areas, each with clear architectural styles, and unique feels.   It's definitely one of the best cities I've seen in an open world game like this, and while it's not so fun to just drive around once you've done the story, it's definitely part of the character of the game itself (and surprisingly memorable to navigate too).  Overall, I do recommend Mafia 3.  While the first game holds a special place in my heart (how many other games have the cops pull you over for doing 35 in a 30...), and I felt more comfortable in the world of the second game, it's a testament to the world building of 3 that while it's not a comfortable world to inhabit, particularly as Lincoln Clay, but that I wanted to see what would happen, both to the city, and to Lincoln. For the other launch criticisms of poor performance and crashes, I had no such issues, the game was routinely locked at my screen refresh of 120fps except for brief moments maybe 2 or 3 times a playsession when the game was buffering in another part of the city.  Perhaps with less RAM, or a slower GPU it might struggle, but I suspect it's been heavily optimised since launch."
76147294,english,0,360430,"[b]Mediocre at best.[/b]   This game was never finished to the fullest. And after re-release of ""Definitive Edition"" experience  got even worse across all platforms. I will get back  to that later.   Game looks amazing and stunning at times. Has great Soundtracks of the late 60s. All tho still not as big as GTA or Saints Row earlier releases. But thats ok.   Combat is pretty good along with the new finishing moves and rechargeable slow-mo ability that you can use on a go. Also you get a bigger choice in arsenal, and not just small arms but big heafty weapons too. Always a big plus in my book, just remember to farm some cash because  they arn't cheap. I guess inflation impacted all. I almost forgot, you can carry only 2 weapons at a time.   Plenty of nice cars to drive and race if you get to that point. However you can't save any random vehicle in ur garage [i]Psst you don't really have one anyway..[/i]    You can only call for the ones you own or unlocked, you select the car from the list and get it delivered to your location just as weapons van or money pick up. Yes there are no weapon shops anymore.   [i]Q: Can I upgrade my cars?..[/i] A: Yes but mostly for the looks, only gear transition makes any changes in performance. Rest has to be either earned or purchased (locked to progress of the story) [i]Q: really?[/i] A: Si.   [b]Districts[/b]  Ahh yes the new implementation to the game that didn't do  anything new. Idea that was pretty good in Saints Row 2 and fun to play in co-op and really bad in The Godfather 2. Here you take away 9 districts (6 if you look for choice) away from Bad Sal Marcanos hands and you call the shots on who gets what district to rule and what benefits you  receive from it all or how much of a cut you get from it... But not to fast you will have to do additional tedious fetch quests if you want to max your earn from EACH! district. OK?! Alrigh.   [b]Story[/b] It exists... Its the rest of the gameplay that dosn't hold the torch to  that story with isn't bad, but has no grip like the old ones.  The best moments are literally when you are after consiglieres. The rest is rinse and repeat Go there and find out what he knows. ok now go there and interrogate this or that guy.. ok ok noww gooo and kill all soldiers till Capo shows up! And you go on like that x 15-16 times. Oh FUN! Worth it!   [b]Now onto the things that made me sad and than mad.[/b]   [b]BUGS[/b] Bugs that prevent you from progressing story, solution? [i]Yes load last checkpoint, no biggy but annoying.[/i]   Random crashes and + achievement stat reset. (You can't view your ingame stats like in previous M2 that would be to much to ask for, so make notes) Game gets to call the shots on that one I'm afraid, and when it dose it resets your stats like: total money earned/spent, how many underbosses you flipped or killed, how many enemies you've killed with specific weapon, melee kills and distance travelled with super car... Awesome! Apparently they use to be fine before the ""Definitive joke"" release, but after it was a different story. I can confirm I have to work around them because  attempting speedrun is somewhat impossible with random  crashes. Be warned! game is unstable.    AI is more of an A than I when it comes to driving.  Doing 120mph on a road (Police dont mind) approaching crossing section, one tw4t! decides to slow down while  you are close by so you have minimal chance to avoid him... EVERY SINGLE TIME! Its like they see you coming and  become brain dead. Because F you man and your nice car.   Ohh and dont even get me started on the laughable ""damage model"" of the cars. none existent. Sounds ok to me.. some say. Yeah well until your hood opens up and you can't close it down like in the previous Mafia 2  [i]I've used the hood view while racing on the busy streets.[/i]        RED ALERT! RED ALERT!! SPOILERS AHEAD!  Hear me out. Ending of the Mafia 1 [spoiler]Story deepens, get immersive  Toma's Angelos wisdom words after being shot like a dog on his front yard. Heart breaking[/spoiler]   Ending of Mafia 2 [spoiler]Simple but still gripping, attaches you to characters Last words after completing final mission. [i]""Sorry kid.. ******* wasn't part of our deal""[/i] Jaw dropping and heart stopping moment.[/spoiler]   Ending of Mafia 3 [spoiler]Little connection to your underbosses Cutscenes says more about your actions, good last confrontation with Sal Marcon (3 ending)  [u]Only one of 'em is cool.[/u] Donovan steal the whole show! xD Aahahahahahah[/spoiler]   [spoiler]Seriously i want to know what the hell is Donovan going to do after his last action. Where is he going to run.... I want to know.[/spoiler]   DLC are alright I guess Well maybe except that last part with renovating  Sammy's place, what a joke.    [b]Summery[/b]   It feels like a new engine demo, with alot of ideas  thrown in together to see what sticks and what dosn't.  I'm all for innovations and risky ideas to change or  improve the experience, that is how we get good games  in the first place. But when the game tries to be different and fails at doing so, Nvm the fact that it has unfixed bugs or that it lacks in attention to detail in some departaments. But when the main attribute of the series (story) fails to make an impact... man something went wrong.   Its hard for me to recommend this guys, especially after  Definitive joke Edition release. And I'm a big fan. I will be honest.. NO! its just boring, no soule   However. 1968 can be best experienced here if your willing to close your eyes on few things here and there. apart from that treat it like a modern mainstream game.

133873239,english,1,360430,I really enjoy the game. Have played thru it numerous times. Just started back thru it again. I am probably one of the oldest PC gamers still gaming at seventy two years young. If anyone is older I would like to hear about your gaming experience. Have been a gamer since the beginning of gaming...LOL
97967167,english,0,360430,"I have a pretty high tolerance for bad gameplay when the story is good, so I really believed I could finish this game in spite of its flaws. I was wrong. I heard the game is a buggy, repetitive mess with bad mechanics - but the Mafia 1 remake used the same engine and was actually really good, so I figured... how bad can it be? If the story is good (and that's the one thing the reviews seem to agree on), I'll get through it. I was wrong.  What broke me was not the unbelievably high number of bugs and glitches for a AAA game that's been out for 5 years, nor the fact that the graphics are embarassingly bad with the stupidly short draw distances and exaggerated pop-in, terrible lighting effects and just flat out boring visuals (GTA V was released 3 years earlier and looks a hundred times better). It wasn't the wonky gameplay, subpar driving mechanics ( + no fast travel), repetitive missions, god-awful AI, annoying intrusive and unnecessary HUD,  bad UI, or pointless chores like stashing your money after every big mission so you don't lose it when you die. I can live with all of that. It's extremely annoying, but I can handle it.  What broke me is something I didn't actually see other reviews mention at all - The terrible way the story is intergrated into the game: In Mafia 3, you don't get to go do story missions whenever you want to, potentially ignoring all of the repetitive side activities, like you would in other open world games. No. You go around doing repetitive side activities, and after you've done enough, you get rewarded with a little bit of story. The story, while good and carried well by really good voice acting, is basically bait. It's dangled in front of you like a prize to get you to do more crappy boring shit, and just when the tensions are high and you feel it getting interesting... hold it! Gotta grind for another 2 hours, then you'll get to see what happens next.  That's just inexcusable. I stopped when I finally got my gang together, and then unlocked 5 new neighborhoods to go do repetitive shit in before I can get a few more crumbs of story. The game even had the audacity at this point to tell me ""Hey, since this is the Definitive Edition, here's some DLC side content you can do as well!"" I just said to myself - ""Nope, I'm not doing this shit"", closed the game and uninstalled it.  This game is an absolute disaster. Don't buy it, and don't even play it if you got it for free. It's not worth you time."
40016118,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 Pros and Cons  Pros: -Music -Vito Scaletta returns -John Donovan -Fun gunplay  - Actual Story assassinations are fun and new -Explains why you can cut through enemies -Family -Different Endings -Cutscenes are very pretty -Story was alright but different than what you've seen before  Cons: -Lackluster missions -Terrible stealth system -Cars are very weird -Not an actual mafia -Cover mechanics are weird -Weird Issues with lighting - Had to restart missions at some points throughout the game for NPCS getting stuck on random things. - No Joe Barbaro   DLC: The DLC is very different than the main game, it actually offers fun levels leading to the end and you actually feel as if you are accomplishing something. Stones unturned was a very fun DlC and gave me a smile throughout the entire adventure. There is not very much to say about the DLCS  Overall as a fan of the trilogy I enjoyed the game very much, the repetitive missions were not as much of problem to me compared to others, depends on how you feel about grinding. The story was very different to me because Mafia 2 is one of my favourite games of all time and Mafia 3 certainly does not live up to it but it still has a lot to offer to a new-comer or an oldie.  7.5/10"
105752312,english,1,360430,"i didn't understand the hate for this game, but i recently realized the reason why.  mafia 1 and 2 are relatively short (between 10-15 hours), linear stories with little to no pause between chapters, and no great reason to venture beyond the given path. (now for the record, i also adore both 1 and 2 for what they are.)  but mafia 3 deviates away from that. it plops you into a big open world city where you are free to do what you please, when you please. there is little to no direction given for what you ""must"" do or go. added, the story is also about 4x the length of its predecessors.  [b]i sincerely think[/b] the reason this game gets the flak that it does is because those who enjoyed mafia 1 and 2 are people who primarily enjoy the more linear gaming experience. and there is nothing wrong with that! but because of it, mafia 3 can be very overwhelming if you don't know what you're getting into or have your expectations fixed on something closer to the other games.  because there is a LOT to do in mafia 3. and quite honestly, this was the experience i was hoping for all along from a mafia game. i LOVE fighting for rackets, assigning districts, and all of the characters are just excellent. i feel in control and invested, this city is gorgeously designed, and i love a good revenge story. people say the story is ""simple"" but, that sounds so dismissive of what a good story it really is. seriously, does it NEED to be complicated? it's not exactly like the previous two games were particularly complex, but their stories were also great!  as for ""grindy"" and ""repetitive"" gameplay: i only half-agree. primarily, seriously, ya'll gotta get fucking creative! if you're just going in guns blazing with the same loadout for every interaction, yeah, it's gonna get stale. but the game gives you ample options to mix it up. [i]so mix it up![/i]  [b]BUT[/b], as i mentioned above, if you're the type of gamer who only enjoys a more linear experience, i can see this becoming tedious.  but for me? i fucking love it. i haven't been so hyped for a game from story to characters in like over a year.  so to recap/t;ldr: [b]Mafia 3 is NOT a linear gaming experience. It is open world, free choice, and very long (when compared to the other mafia titles). Story and characters are excellent, but if its gaming style not what you are looking for, stick with Mafia 1 and 2.[/b]"
25936825,english,0,360430,"Well, I have been reading through most reviews, positives and negatives and none of them seems to match my fellings about this game, so I decided to write one myself. I'll List pros, cons and neutrals and give my conclusions at the end of the review. Maybe its just luck but I haven't experienced a single CTD and only very few fps drops (After the fps patch they seem to become more common, but still manageable) and one small freeze.  I'll update the review at each new patch or fix released.  Pros: + Catching story and interesting historical setting + Good voice acting and facial animations. + Great atmosphere and city. Makes you feel inside the game and the historical context + AMAZING soundtrack. 60's rock, blues, jazz and country all the way fitting perfectly with the overrall setting. + Interesting characters, rich dialogues and the plot seems consistent so far even if sometimes its feels rushed. + Impressive lightining effects even though there still some bugs and some people that dislike it. + Cinematic narrative. It feels like you are watching a documentary about your character life and impact on New Bordeaux crime scene.  Neutrals: . Driving Mechanic. I personally like it, as it seems like real driving but I guess a lot of people will not think like me. . Somewhat strange animations. (Getting into or out of cover, Lincoln running with a gun and pedestrians animations are particularly weird.) . A not-so-free world. Even though you can just hang around the city without any specific objective there isnt much to do outside the missions and collectables (It seems there will be patches to fix this, wich reinforces my final conclusion) . Racket System gets repetitive too soon. . Cluttered UI. I can go past it, but it's really annoying sometimes. . Textures are not high-ended and polished as one could expect from a 2016 AAA game but it doesn't mean they are ugly!  Cons: - Grainy and often foggy graphics. (The fps patch released on 10/08 adress this, it looks much better now but still an issue) - Step back from Mafia I and II. Shops, bars, clubs are useless even though they are marked on the map, policemen dont care if you are driving 120mph, cargoes dont get damaged etc. These small bits of realism that made the Mafia series unique are absent. - Very restricted field of view (remember GTA 3 and VC? That the map loading was so slow that you could go to someplace before it was even loaded?) (10/09 Update: Fps update adress this as well, it looks reasonable now) - Notable graphic quality drop from cutscenes to actual gameplay.  - FPS lock (30 fps in 2016? Seriously?!) (Even if now there is a patch for that it still a HUGE flaw for a pc game coming out with a 30fps lock) - Bizarre night and day cycle. There's no in-game clock (at least I haven't seem one) and day/night cycles looks totally random for me. - Bizarre control scheme (Why not use GTA scheme?) (I play on a controller btw, things seem shitier for keyboard users) - Very Dumb AI. Enemies and NPC's both. - Overral feeling that you are a playing a BETA and not a finished game. Especially because the next patches will bring things that should already be in the game (as outfit changing, street races, interactive shops etc)  Conclusions:  1) Mafia III is a consistent game with a lot of potencial. Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales. Actually I would give it a 6/10 but it has potencial to hit as high as 9/10 or higher.  2) This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me.  3) DONT PRE-PURCHASE!!! Pre-purchasing ANYTHING is just plain dumb. You are giving away your money in exchange for the promise of a product and NOT for the product itself. This is destructive to any kind of industry as the quality tends to drop as the profitability of that product is already guaranteed before the product even exists. And in my humble opinion this is exactly what happened with Mafia III. A game that was released rushedly and unfinished, with no concern to customer satisfaction as a healthy profit was already safe and sound way before the release date."
40153590,english,1,360430,"[u] M3[/u]  So; like most people, before buying this game I was kinda turned away from it from hearing about it's mixed reception.  I came in optimistic and I played it non-stop for an entire week.  So yeah, I really like this game. Speaking as a fan of the entire trilogy.  The first main game-tweak I noticed that made the game more fun to play compared to [b]M1 & M2[/b], was the open-world approach of; do anything, whenever you want. -- Both [b]M1 & M2[/b] have story missions that are often driving from one edge of the map to another for entire chapters. But the way this game handles 'city district takedowns' with 10+ objectives to go to in the zone, where you only need to clear 5-6 to progress in the story.  Also, the racket-takedown / infiltration parts are not nearly as shallow or repetitive as its reputation would have you believe. You get new weapons and tools, and there are numerous strategies to test and experiment with each time.  -- In addition to the many twists the game throws on that aspect during the mid-to-late game.  Looking at the statistics on, say, achievements, apparently between 1/5 or 1/4 people actually reached the ending of the game. Perhaps this is part in how those critizisms were overblown?  And on the big subject of the game's setting change from [b]M1 & M2[/b]: it's still a crime drama like the rest of the series.  With the characters I'll say, as a huge Mafia II fan and an MGS fan; Lincoln to Vito is the Raiden to Solid Snake. -- That's not a bad thing.  Also on the setting, the game-feel is different and more modernized, this also confused many fans. My best response to this is to take a qoute from [b]YouTuber ChuggaConroy[/b], when he played trough [b]Super Mario Sunshine[/b] and commented on how different it was to all other main-series games in that:   [h1]""I wouldn't say it's unpolished, it's just a different kind of polish""[/h1]   If you're an optimist, you'll most likely enjoy it.  -- Just remember to spend some time in the in-game settings before diving in, the 'kinda dark default lighting', the keyboard controls for movement, combat and driving.   I urge you not to be turned of by the reputation, there's a really good game under its rocky start."
28173471,english,0,360430,"As much as I wanted to like it, I simply cant. The starting story (the first 20 ish minutes of the game was the best parts, and for 15 of those minutes it's a cutescene and for the other 5 you're in a bank). The story dies off and is followed up by repetitive gameplay doing the same thing over and over again but with different looking enemies.  Step 1: Deal damage.  Step 2: Kill officers. Step 3: Kill distict bosses. Step 4: Make higher ups angry and then kill them (also they spawn in the same place, not even a new area).  Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 about 6 or more times and then call it a game.  Also it's great when the vehicles and ai glitch making it lag and having explosions everywhere. The ai of this game invented drifing 100% All in all not worth $60 in the slightest. More around $30 ish. Just play dishonered 1 or 2. They are much better."
101468353,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 marks the last game in the Mafia trilogy and with the general reception it received, it could end up being the last new Mafia game for a long time.  I last played Mafia 3 back when it released in 2016. I remember playing it, enjoying it and moving on. Since then I've played tons of other games and my opinions have changed. I know that today, Mafia 3 is pretty heavily criticised and has a pretty bad reputation overall.  After beating the game all over again, I can say I do recommend it, but just barely and with a huge warning attached. I won't lie to you, this should have been the best Mafia ever made, its lost potential is found in every damn part of it. After playing it I can conclude that I suspect this game was a victim of rushed/rocky development. For every amazing or high quality aspect, there are some mind boggling omissions. Of course, we will never truly know what happened whilst this game was being made. All we have is the final product.  The story tries a lot of things. While I love the idea behind it all, it feels unfortunately rushed and improperly thought out just like many other elements of the game. You follow Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam War veteran and coloured man living in the fictional New Bordeaux in Southern America in the late 60's. Without spoiling anything, the game is an overarching revenge plot as Lincoln leads a war against the Italian Mob after they take everything away from him. The actual revenge plot is pretty compelling overall. The introduction is quite lengthy and definitely helps you learn many of the characters, making it hit even harder when everything comes crashing down. The game does a great job of making you absolutely hate these enemy characters. The main issue revolves around the theme of racism and the main villain himself. To discuss the themes, racism is extremely prominent in this game. Due to the time period and location presented, I expected racism to be pretty prominent. However, I don't think I am alone when I say this game is incredibly self indulgent in it. You will hear the n word probably almost a hundred times before the game is over. Initially its uncomfortable, but after you hear it a hundred times you become numb to it. Its pretty obvious that the story has undertones of coloured revenge on white people, seeing as you are a coloured man taking down an entire empire consisting of almost entirely racist white people. This isn't an issue on its own, it is however very transparent in pointing towards an agenda when it didn't need to be. The people you face in this game are already horrible people, you don't need to remind that they're racist every five seconds to motivate me to take them out. As for the villain, he is just plain hollow. He is kinda just a piece of shit and nothing else. His personality is that he is a racist, greedy psychopath and that's about it.  On a technical level, this game is a huge mixed bag. Characters can look extremely detailed, but on the other hand some side characters look like they were pulled from a ps2 sports game crowd. The weather effects look downright bad and the sky-boxes look atrocious for a modern game. Some buildings look highly detailed whilst others are flat and bland. The vehicles look really good across the board, however the damage modelling is basic and unimpressive. Some animations are highly polished, whilst others like the molotov throw look hilarious in comparison. I could go on and on, but all you have to do is watch some gameplay for yourself. Its crazy hard to get immersed when the visuals are pulling you in so many different directions.  Thankfully, the game is pretty great in the sound department. Most of the voice actors do a pretty good job overall. General sounds are of a quality standard and the guns sound punchy. The music in this game is also incredible. Its an awesome selection of classics from the 60's era and made driving around far more interesting with the awesome tracks blasting behind me. My only complaint in the music department, is as you switch vehicles you will hear tracks repeating quite often and there is a very tiny selection of radio stations in game.  Being totally honest, Mafia 3 has one of the most oddly designed gameplay loops I have ever experienced. The gameplay on its own summarises why I feel this game was rushed. This also represents where the majority of complaints towards the game originated from. The idea is simple, there are 9 districts total, each containing two rackets you must take over. You follow a simple formula. You do a bunch of small objectives until you do so much damage to a racket, you eliminate the person running it and then you rinse and repeat. Once you have taken the two rackets in a district, you take out the main head of the district, dole it out to one of your under bosses and then you do it all over again for every single other district. The game feels good to play, but the mission variety is seriously lacking. The melee is kinda piss poor, but the shooting mechanics themselves are great. You spend the majority of the game just taking out district after district with very few proper story missions spread throughout. As everyone else has already said, it is a literal grind and a lengthy one at that. You take districts, dole them out, kill more lieutenants and do it over and over.  Here is the warning, if you do not enjoy Mafia 3's raw gameplay, then there is nothing for you here, run the hell away. If the shooting and raw mechanics weren't so satisfying for me, I would not have pushed through, hell no. The driving controls crazy good and the shooting is very satisfying, especially with the late game weapons. However, the objects are repetitive as hell and do not improve over the course of the game.  I know it sounds like i'm ripping the game to pieces, but overall I'm just mixed as hell. The raw mechanics are fun, but the objectives are basic and uninspired. The game is visually inconsistent, but the cutscenes look incredible. The setting is well depicted and the music is awesome. There is a lot to love, and a lot to despise about Mafia 3.  The game was fairly stable for the most part. The game does find it pretty hard to maintain a stable 60 frames regardless of settings, however the game never dropped below the 40's on high settings so it wasn't a huge issue. The only really bad bugs I experienced had to do with alt-tabbing. Everytime without fail, if I alt-tabbed the game it would erase the sfx audio, cause severe stuttering and the cutscenes would freeze. It is important to note that many of the bugs I experienced in Mafia Definitive Edition are present in this game also, which is pretty garbage.  The game took me around 17 hours to beat, so it is quite lengthy, but a lot of that is a district grind that not everyone is going to find tolerable. If you can get the game cheap, I would recommend giving it a try. Its not a bad game, but its got a ton of flaws riding against it. I recommend it just barely, but with a lot of warnings attached. Its a shame, because this could have been something far better."

121165154,english,1,360430,"I don't know why I got so hooked on this one. It is by all means a mediocre open world game - not even close to the excellency of RDR2. But something stange happend (I'd experienced it with DAYS GONE too): I kept on playing and having fun. I liked the writing, I liked the protagonist. It was refreshing playing an african-american hero and he managed to be both likeable, earnest and a total badass. I thought the world-building was well done too: The city looked like a real, geographical place, not a jumble of motifs and the team managed to design some beautiful set-pieces for the main missions: While abandoned theme parks and insane asylums don't sound very original in the context of a videogame, here, they were realized with such an attention to detail that I really enjoyed exploring.  Speaking of the missions: These are hit and miss. Most of the main missions that don't involve your criminal day-to-day activities are great, like [spoiler] your fight against a demonic new-age cult or the hunt for a lost sowiet warhead [/spoiler], but the rest is VERY repetitive, lacks variety and can occasionaly get tedious. It never pur me off playing though, maybe because the developers pulled of some great driving physics and gunplay. I truly enjoyed the shootouts and I liked how they allowed you to seamlessly combine stealth and violence. Overall the gameplay mechanics worked really well for me - save for the bugs of which there still are quite a few. Fortunately, none are game-breaking, most aren't even that annoying.  Story-wise, I'd say, I'm kinda 80% satisfied. Haden Blackman, the man who wrote Mafia III, also writes comic books which I felt was both a gift and a curse, since most of the characters were deftly written and felt solid enough for video game characters, but they did sometimes veer into Whedon-esque quips which I disliked. The dialogues with the CIA agent were particularly annoying. There were occasionaly points where I felt the writing was somewhat construed in order to move the plot along but it wasn't too bad. If RDR2 is the prime example of how to write interesting dialogues and make your characters archetypical instead of stereotypical, then Mafia III was a solid effort with some obvious shortcomings. At least they managed to nail late 60s in southern USA (at least as far as I can tell): Some of the radio commentary where bigots complain about the government's fair housing act because they fear their neighborhoods becoming open to black folks were hard to listen to because they sounded so realistic and were excellently voiced, just like the rest of the game by the way. There's not one weak performance.  So that's the stuff I liked. The criticisms brought up by others are all valid. Mafia III is repetitive, it lacks variety. It didn't feel dull to me, though, and I'd recommend you give it a try if you can get it on sale."
51071109,english,0,360430,"Let's start this review off by saying I played Mafia 2 many years ago and I absolutely loved it. Till this day it's one of my favourite games of all time.  When I heard that Mafia 3 was coming out, I was over the moon and I pre-ordered it which in the end was a big mistake. The game looked promising at first and it had a chance of being something great but it wasn't. Immediately after Mafia 3 was released, I played it non stop for 7 hours and after that I never touched it again. It was dull, repetitive, unpolished and I was utterly disappointed.  Today, after 3 years I decided to give it another chance. I really wanted to like this game but after a couple hours in I remembered exactly why I stopped playing. The missions are repetitive and you will be doing the same shit over and over again in each district. There, of course, are some good things too. The combat system is brutal, the music is awesome and the story seems okay so far but unfortunately I can't bring myself to play this game any longer when there are so many amazing games out there. It's unfortunate this game is not what I hoped it would be."
184974002,english,1,360430,"I got to buy myself a copy of this game with all the stigma of it not being a ""good"" mafia game. First of all, I must agree it is not really a Mafia game. Whilst playing you realise quite quickly that in reality is about putting end to the whole mafia mentality and getting revenge for those who were lost. Those new allies who were found in the process stood by your side. It was never meant for you to be a part of Mafia, but to build something a little better in the wicked world of ours. Story was great I really enjoyed it. Characters had good screen time ( mainly the allies ). Sadly without much development excluding, Clay, Donovan, Father James, Vito and Sal. Others were good too but for me did not have that much impact on the whole world/story of the game. DLCs were great I enjoyed them all. The first one with witch hunt was amazing story, that gave more time for Lincoln to develop, The second one with Roxy, was more fun but had a great background and I really enjoyed working with The Voice ( voice acted by a my guy Lee from TWD The Game Series :3 ). The third one with donovan was quick but action packed shit show, that was enjoyable too. Gameplay was most of the time very good. Some game mechanics polished over time, but there is still some bugs that can influence your opinion on the game. Its the nitt picky stuff, I enjoyed the game as is.  And to those the game was boring and too long of the same I strongly disagree. Mainly beating small racket bosses and then killing Sals lieutenants. Yeah it had its moments, but I still enjoyed killing every single KKK member, getting rid of the greedy fucks that were ruining the lives of many people. A literal ONE MAN ARMY!!  I can say I did all the SQ too, and it made the game whole. Just one thing is missing from this game. FAST TRAVEL MAN. The driving mainly for SQ was sometimes BORING :D.  8.5/10. Good job Hangar 13. Love from Slovakia."

This story is about Lincoln Clay, a US Army veteran deployed during the Vietnam War as part of an elite unit. Back from the conflict, his involvement with the mafia families soon backfires: a deal gone wrong is all it takes to set Lincoln on a quest for revenge.

From the cars, dresses and mannerisms of people - everything just blends together very well in a consistent manner. A lot of the buildings of this very large city are even explorable, which is something the previous Mafia chapters didn't have. The devs also made a bold move in depicting racism and discrimination with an uncensored form.  [b]2.[/b] Shootouts and fights are daily routine in a city plagued by gang wars and power struggles. Lincoln, on his bloody path, will face hundreds of enemies - so the combat better be damn good, and it indeed is. Weapon hits on foes have a good weight, for instance it's not rare to see enemies fly away after being hit by a shotgun, or contorting on the ground mortally wounded, before expiring. This realism does extend also to melee and takedown moves, which are quite a show too. Most weapon classes indeed play out and feel diverse, each with a specific style.  [b]3.[/b] The soundtrack encompassing and eventually emphasizing critical story events is well picked. Radio stations constantly broadcast a stream of iconic hits from the times, along with news and other chatter. Solid.  [h3]Cons[/h3] [b]1.[/b] By far, the biggest issue of Mafia III is the extreme tediousness of its tasks. Be it main missions, side activities or secondary quests, the majority of them falls into a very narrow set of archetypes that becomes stale very quickly. ""Go there, kill everyone, interrogate someone / steal something, go back to base."" Rinse and repeat for the whole game, i'm not even exaggerating one bit. There are some exceptions to this, but they're few and far in-between, way too far.  [b]2.[/b] Hundreds upon hundreds of collectible bits are scattered throughout the city, ranging from CDs to components and other stuff. They are often tedious to get, serve no purpose exception made for Components, and become a constant drag composed of ""get out of your car, get the shiny bit, go back into the car"", this for hundreds and hundreds of time on end. That's not all: main missions force players to first clear certain sets of side activities that always follow the same archetypes, thus further bloating the content.  [b]3.[/b] On paper, Mafia III has a lot of tools, upgrades and weapons to unlock at the Vendor and through raising the influence of Lincoln's associates. However, this progression never feels like it makes any major change: newly acquired weapons or upgrades (which involve significant grind) are never game changers as they feel marginally better at best, so the base combat / driving / exploring feel will not be changed much, nor the variety of approaches expanded by these upgrades.  [b]4.[/b] Enemy AI is dumb as bricks. Seriously. They will mindlessly expose themselves and try to snipe Lincoln with a pistol from miles away, while the protagonist uses a sniper rifle, for example. Enemies will often be oblivious or have very slow reaction times to Lincoln in stealth, which proves overpowered most of the time. This on the highest difficulty even.   [b]5.[/b] Graphics quality is very inconsistent even in this ""Definitive"" version. Some textures or models will be low quality, while others definitely up to par, seemingly without reasons. Draw distance will literally make cars or even buildings appear from thin air at random no matter the settings, while lighting effects have weird afterglows and ""trails"" in many situations, which is immersion breaking. In addition optimization is trash, with random FPS drops at times on a high-end machine.  [h1]Gameplay Breakdown[/h1]  [b]Exploration[/b] Is performed either on foot or by vehicle, there is no fast travel so everything has to be reached manually. New Bordeaux is a massive city littered with hundreds of collectibles, that have to be revealed by Wiretapping junction boxes (shown on the global map), provided Lincoln has enough Components to do so, which are scattered around. There is no worthwhile exploration to do apart from seeking and using Wiretaps to reveal everything in a map chunk, then repeat the process over and over.  [b]Combat[/b] Plays out in third-person shooter fashion, with the protagonist being able to carry two weapons at a time, belonging to different categories such as Shotguns, Pistols and so on. Most weapons either have to be found or unlocked at a trader for hefty sums, same goes for gadgets such as grenades or other contraptions. Stealth is a valid approach to most situations as well, being Lincoln a trained veteran, which can take down any enemy in melee combat - silently. Vehicle combat is also a thing, with the ability of shooting and throwing explosives from most cars, useful during chases.  [b]Management[/b] Consists in progressively conquering parts of the city, subtracting resources such as drug traffics from the mafia families and taking them under Lincoln's control. Several associates will progressively be unlocked for story reasons, each will manage the activities the protagonist assigns them, in turn unlocking specific rewards from a unique list each of them has. Many side missions needs to be completed to fully fortify an Underboss' position and unlock everything they have to offer as reward.  [b]Quests[/b] Are divided into Main, Secondary and Tasks. Usually the main ones progress the story, while others fortify the position of an Underboss or give Lincoln personal gains such as money or other rewards. They are unlocked on the global map as the mains story proceeds.

34240370,english,0,360430,"**Pros**  -Beautifully rendered city environment -Great soundtrack -Offers a variety of tactical choices in combat  **Cons**  -Shooting gallery AI -Dull and repetitive missions -Weak plot  Mafia III is like a selfish lover - it starts fast, climaxes early, and then rolls over and goes to sleep. After starting by throwing you into the action and quickly progressing to the game's dramatic turning point, it never gives you any compelling reasons to keep playing. Lincoln's quest for revenge after his betrayal is boring, implausible, and mind-numbingly repetitive.  The missions have little to no variety: kill, coerce, and destroy, in unchallenging and uncreative ways. There's no emotional urgency or tactical challenge to any of the laundry list of tasks that Lincoln is obligated to complete in order to advance the plot. They feel like delaying tactics to avoid progressing directly to the game's final showdown, instead of elements of a tightly woven narrative.  That's really a shame, because the game has a lot of promising elements that could have been made into an extremely compelling story. The atmosphere of social and racial tension that forms the backdrop of the game is portrayed in a pretty nuanced and thoughtful way (Dixie Mafia and voodoo dolls aside). People on the street freely share their opinions of the social and cultural upheavals of the late 60s, and their observations are generally authentic to the period. The talk radio programs also do a good job of exploring the polarization that existed during the period. And the sights and sounds of New Bordeaux are truly immersive. There are beachgoers, Mardi Gras revelers, heroin addicts, and a whole array of small touches that makes it feel as if you're truly moving through an inhabited city. Unfortunately, the story line fails to do its setting justice.  If Lincoln had been forced to conceal his identity and gather information on his own, slowly revealing the elements of the conspiracy that led to his betrayal, the game's narrative tension would've been much higher and the missions would've been more satisfying. Instead, the game introduces an old CIA buddy who's just completely out of place and irritatingly cartoonish. His sole purpose is to chain smoke and give out information that advances the plot through exposition instead of action. He may as well have been named MacGuffin. The only contribution his presence makes to the game is unearned information, deathly boring cutscenes of congressional testimony, bad acting, and goofy wiretap sidequests. It's an idea that should've been cut out the game entirely.  -GAME MECHANICS-  On normal settings, the AI will occasionally try to flush you out and flank you, but for the most part enemies will generously comply with staying in one spot and repeatedly sticking out their heads for you to blow off. Enemies will also offer themselves up like lambs to the slaughter when Lincoln ambushes from cover, repeatedly walking into the same trap despite the five foot high pile of bodies in front of it. Lincoln also has the ability to pick up and move bodies out of sight, in order to remain undetected. The cover mechanic is a bit wonky, making it difficult to move quickly from cover to cover, or to pick the intended cover in the first place, but given the AIs general incompetence, it's not that much of an issue. The ambush from cover mechanic is one of the more satisfying tools in the game, but as I mentioned earlier, it can be exploited because the AI will never avoid sending waves of enemies to the same ambush spot.  Despite the array of tools that Lincoln can be outfitted with, from molotov cocktails to proximity mines, combat overall is pitifully generic and unchallenging. The wide variety of heights, interiors, objects and landscapes that the game renders so meticulously are never fully exploited. Every encounter is a shooting gallery.  Shooting, driving, running and climbing all work pretty well. Bullet time is available, but the action was never intense enough that I even thought about using it. There's also a so-called ""intel view"" that gives you x-ray vision, and makes no logical sense.  -GRAPHICS-  New Bordeaux is beautifully rendered, with a wide variety of landscapes and neighborhoods on a sprawling game map. Many have complained about the game's poor optimization, but it runs well and looks stunning on my rig. YMMV.  -FINAL THOUGHTS-  Despite its lofty aspirations and beautifully-rendered setting, Mafia III's story and gameplay just never finds its footing, and it winds up lost in the bayou swamps. 5/10  System Specs: Win 10 64 bit | EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB GPU | Core i5 7600K @ 3.8 GHz CPU | ASRock Z270 Pro4 mobo | Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3200 16 GB RAM | PNY CS2030 480 GB NVMe SSD | WD Blue 7200 RPM 1TB HDD"
118606968,english,1,360430,"I know I might be a bit late, because the game came out around mid 2020, but I just had to make this review...  I don't even know where to start.  I'll start off by saying that this game is, for me, at least, the best Mafia game out of the three. With: a really big, open world, a lot of fun optional chapters, three FREE DLC stories that are really fun, and quite long, and an AMAZING story. This makes the game the best one out of the three.  Of course, as much as the game is amazing, it is not perfect. It does have bugs, some repetitive quests, but, that is quite small compared to everything else! I've spent a little over 74 hours on the game, and those were well spent hours. The bugs do not happen too often, but, they sometimes force you to load to your last checkpoint, which takes only about 10 seconds to do.  The story is... a masterpiece. Now... I know that some missions are repetitive, but the story as one of its kind, is amazing. A lot of heartbreaking, twisted, fun, hyper, sad, emotional, etc... moments, make the story a solid 10/10.  The optional chapters are also indeed very fun and interesting! They're not necessary, of course, hence why they're called ""optional"" chapters, but, they really build up a story for certain characters! Believe it or not, if you want to know the real story of some characters, you MUST finish the optional chapters. Optional chapters gave me even more amazing experience, and I would have hated myself if I did not finish them.  Story aside, let me talk about the graphics, physics, guns, cars, voice actors, soundtrack, etc...  The graphics are really good! It really gave a ""cherry on the top"" vibe, because it really is so beautiful. Not too great, not too bad. Right where the sweet spot is! A PC with average components will be able to run the game on max settings at 1080p with no problems!  The physics are also good! Sure, there are a few bugs here and there (e.g. if you turn on Aim Assist, at some points, it'll be more unhelpful, than helpful, but that's not always the case! Also, Aim Assist is recommended if you're playing with a controller, because the general sensitivity for a controller is kinda too fast for some certain guns.) Other than that, the physics are how they should be! Really well done, if you look over those small bugs.  There is a wide selection of guns. I personally loved using a simple pistol! I've felt most comfortable with it. My secondary weapon was an AK-47. Definitely helped me through all the ""Kill 'Em All"" moments, in which, a lot of enemies spawned. As I've stated, if you're using a controller, some guns may be a little harder to use than they should, but, Aim Assist should fix that (partly!)  I am not a guy that's into cars that much, but, this game made it so fun for me to just spend time driving around the map. My favourite type of cars was the Exotic section. Especially the fast, red one at the very bottom! They're very easy to control, and the modification for the cars is also great! (Note: To unlock all the modifications, and cars, you must complete optional quests, hint hint ;))  Each and every character had an amazing voice actor! The accent, the voice, the tone, it all suited amazingly for every single character! My personal character, and voice actor from the game, was Donovan! He is a complete savage, a really funny guy, and also very based!   Oh how I loved the soundtrack in the game. Excluding the radio, the music in cutscenes, certain chapters, etc... It was really amazing! Each and every soundtrack fit the chapter you were going through, so it really pumps up the hype when you're doing your thing!   Also another very big plus that I'd love to mention is the NPCs (enemies). They're indeed very realistic! (e.g. if you shoot somewhere, alert the enemies, move without being seen, the enemies will go past you to look at the location where you've fired shots from! This is a really great detail, and I don't think that a lot of games do this. Most games just send the enemies to where you currently are, even if you were not spotted. It also helps with taking down enemies faster!   Thank you for sticking with me in this review! I was really happy to write it, because, this game is indeed very special to me. Thank you 2K Games for making this masterpiece."
48337899,english,1,360430,"[h1] Is Mafia 3 a good continuation of the Mafia game series?	[/h1]  I started playing Mafia 3 right after my first playthroughs of Mafia and Mafia 2. I didn't have high expectations because I heard bad things about the game from some of my friends who played the game before. They were disappointed. They are big fans of Mafia games but they didn't like the last game at all. I spent 77 hours in the game finishing every single main and side mission and in my opinion it's a great game. It's just not a very good Mafia game as we know them from before.   Mafia 3 is different. I would compare it more to Watch Dogs or Watch Dogs 2. You no longer have a linear story. You have a huge open world and you have so much freedom in there - couple of main and side missions you can choose from and also you can start playing all 3 DLCs before you finish the game because they are part of the open world as well.  [h1] Story [/h1]  The main protagonist in Mafia 3 is a black man called Lincoln Clay. I can't say I felt much for him. He seems to be a very calm and emotionless person. He is a cool and tough guy, but that didn't make it easier for me to really care for him. He is like an empty shell.  Lincoln's story is a story of revenge. In my opinion the main plot is quite interesting and exciting. It might not seem like it at first, because there are many fillers in between the story parts. I always enjoyed those special final missions of each district which moved the story forward. Sometimes you get to know a bit about what's going to happen before it even happens because parts of the story are video tapes from the future where certain people talk about big and scandalous happenings in the city.  My most favourite character in the game was probably John Donovan, ex C.I.A. agent and close friend of Lincoln. Donovan became his trusted source supplying him with intelligence and advanced government technology. Donovan is a funny guy. Everytime there was a cutscene where Lincoln and Donovan met, Donovan made me laugh so much. He is cool, charismatic and self-confident.   Good news! There are some characters from Mafia 2 in the game so you can definitely look forward to seeing them again. They are the connection to Mafia series. Without them it would feel even less like a third Mafia game in the series.  [h1] DLCs [/h1]  The DLCs in Mafia 3 are simply amazing! I think that they should be part of the main game, but they are not, so please be sure to buy them as well if you decide to buy the game.  The main game can get a bit repetitive sometimes with all the open world activities so DLCs are a great way to add some variety. You should not wait until you finish the game to play them. You should play them before whenever you feel like you need something different. The stories are very special and the developers made some nice environments for it.  DLCs will unlock new equipments for you to use even in the main game afterwards and the ""Faster, baby!"" DLC will help you to earn some extra money which you might need for weapons or upgrades especially early in the game when your income is not that great.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  Your goal is to take over disctricts in the game. There are 9 of them and each district contains two rackets (criminal operations). Each racket will give you several objectives - kill, steal, destroy, interrogate, tail a vehicle. For example it could be an auto theft racket or a prostitution racket. But the gameplay is the same in all those rackets. When you take over both rackets in the disctrict you will unlock the main mission which will move the story forward and which has more special objectives and environments.  Once you take over a racket you can increase its earns to max by doing a very boring mission - delivering a truck with some supplies. I did not like those missions at all. The trucks are so slow and usually very far away.  Other boring missions were the loyalty missions for your underbosses. You want them to be loyal to you to get the best outcome for the game ending but their loyalty missions are so boring and repetitive and there are 6 of them for each of your underbosses. 6 of the same boring missions... 3 times! I wish the loyalty missions were at least as good as the Mafia 3 DLCs. They could have had a deep story. It could have been done so much better! So much potential there considering that one of your underbosses is someone from Mafia 2! Aaaargh :(  There is racing in the game but I haven't tried it apart from one DLC race. My game was often freezing while driving so that would be no fun racing with those fps issues. And there didn't seem to be a benefit for me to do it anyway. I could unlock a new car and some car upgrades, but I didn't feel the need for it. I already had all I needed for my crazy driving style ;)   Jokes aside, the driving in Mafia 3 felt pretty good. All controls were very responsive. I experienced the terrible driving in Watch Dogs so I was very pleased that it was not like that in Mafia 3. I like that the police in this game doesn't try to stop you for breaking the rules. You really have to kill someone with your car in front of them to make them care. And you can listen to the amazing soundtracks of the late 60s era while driving! They are so great!  [h1] Weapons and equipment  [/h1]  There were too many guns in the game for my taste. I could only carry two at the same time so I didn't get to try many of them. I usually just picked those with silencers and used them all the time. There is also so much equipment you can carry - proximity mines, grenades,  molotovs, screaming zemis, c4s, sniper supports and throwing knives.  Most of the time I was trying to do stealth takedowns and not alert all enemies if possible. I was playing the game on the hardest difficulty which makes you dead in a second or two without a cover. And enemies are smart sometimes, they know when you are reloading and they try to rush to your place where you are hiding and kill you before you finish your reload. Healing is possible by using adrenaline shots and your health doesn't regenerate without those healing items (at least not on hard difficulty).  I've never learned to use brutal takedowns, I always found it too risky to fight a person using fists when all the enemies around have guns and can kill me in a second. The tutorial says that enemies will be in shock after you perform a brutal takedown on one of them, but I never got the timing right and I died quickly so I stopped trying. Honestly there are so many ways how you can easily kill your enemies so why to bother with some quick time event brutal takedowns???  [h1] Glitches [/h1]  Mafia 3 is full of glitches. Many times mission NPCs would not talk to me if I entered the room and pressed E to talk to them right away. I would just have to reload my last checkpoint and try again. Then it worked.  I completely lost my main missions after finishing the Stones Unturned DLC. It was such a scary moment. I almost lost 70 hours of my playthrough and I would definitely not start over... I tried to reload the checkpoint to fix it and the game just kept loading forever. I got even more scared. So I restarted the game completely and it was back. Ufffff! They should have fixed things like that.  I decided to share one of the glitches with you here in the Steam review. I was healing myself in this clip at the same time I somehow died so I became a zombie and the enemies couldn't take me down but I couldn't move or shoot. --->[h1]  [url=https://clips.twitch.tv/AlluringGiftedFriseeGingerPower] Mafia 3 ""The Man of Steel"" glitch - Twitch Clip [/url]  [/h1]  [h1] Final Verdict [/h1]  Mafia 3 is not a perfect game. But everyone who loves open world games like Watch Dogs, Sleeping Dogs or even GTA games will love this one as well. If you are a fan of the first two Mafia games and you are not afraid to experience something a bit different, go for it. I think that you will not be disappointed!"
78391840,english,1,360430,"Seems this game's two main criticisms were the repetetive gameplay and bugs.  Well, I didn't encounter any gamebreaking bugs so far and maybe one or two smaller ones in my 11hrs of gameplay.  Repetition... I can understand it for the main story. I'm not too far in, but there are some recurring gameplay elements. Thing is, the gameplay itself is quite fun, so it hasn't bothered me yet.  My only other complaint would be the save checkpoints which are sometimes a bit too harsh.  So with that out of the way: here's what I think of the game.  It's goddamn great.  The story, characters, voice and motion acting are tremendous.  Especially the DLC that's included in this version, are amazing.  You can start playing once you're a bit into the story, but the stories and atmosphere are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. Plus, these missions are more linear like the old Mafia games.  In my opinion, this game is a hidden gem. Hidden because of the bad reviews it probably rightfully deserved when it launched, but now this is truly a diamond of a game.  Against all my expectations, this may be my favorite Mafia game yet.  Let's see if it remains so once I finish it, but so far so good."
107343023,english,0,360430,"The game is essentially the same mission in different locations over and over and over again. For an open world game, nothing is fleshed out and there really isn't anything to do but drive around."
69893871,english,0,360430,"all the bugs, glitches, graphical issues and overall poor quality muddy visuals from the original are in this 'Definitive edition'. it's baffling that a re-released 'remastered definitive edition' of a game can contain every single problem from the original release and introduce some new ones along with it. how embarrassing."
30935101,english,0,360430,"Ok, I need to preface this by stating the following:  1.) I was born in the early '80s. 2.) My parents were Yankees. 3.) I'm whiter than cottage cheese.  To that end I have no real idea if the racism in this game is accurate or a caricature, honestly. I suspect it's somewhere in the middle.  I both enjoyed and was frustrated by this game. It's not really a clear thumbs-up thumbs-down vote. A lot of people will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. There's a lot to do, a lot to see, and a lot to collect. However, those of us, myself included, who want a fleshed out story will be a bit lacking. The game does a lot well, but it has some glaring problems that are, frankly, unforgivable.  Here's the positives first:  1.) The soundtrack is killer. I got the game at a deep discount and the soundtrack alone is well worth what I paid for. It has a great combination of '60s rock, R&B, and pop hits (amongst others). It's a lot of fun to outrun police to the tune of ""Palisades Park"" by Freddy Cannon or have a shootout in a quarry to the tune of ""Folsom Prison Blues"" by Johnny Cash. The developers knew how to use music effectively and did it very well.  2.) The map is quite large. This is somewhat a positive AND a negative as it takes a while to get anywhere. However, the ""GPS"" system works quite well and it's very easy to get around with the help of the minimap. This leads to...  3.) The UI is (generally) well designed. When driving you have a rear view mirror and can easily spin the camera around to see what's going on behind you. The speedometer and tacometer are unobtrusive, if a bit useless. The minimap is great. While on foot, it's easy to see how much ammo you are carrying and your health/armor levels. I also never had any signifigant issues with using something I didn't intend to. The game makes it very clear what item it is you are going to do an action to. There are minor issues when two objects are placed too close to each other, but those are typically insignificant. The game also utilizes several different hotkeys to do different things, so you are never in any real danger of picking up a dead body instead of a dropped weapon.  4.) The vehicles generally behaved realistically. As someone who has driven several vehicles from the mid to late 1960s, I can confirm that they are generally just as sluggish and heavy as they are in the game. In fact, I would say the vehicles in the game perform better than their real-life counterparts.  5.) I personally enjoyed the way the game handled the full cutscenes. The jumps in time were handled well and I really liked watching them. They told the story from a Discovery channel esque ""real crime"" drama taking place in the 2010s. It was unique and I liked the idea.  Now we get to the cons. Some of these are excusable and could potentially have been fixed by patches. Some are inherent flaws in the game that cannot be fixed.  1.) The graphics are generally poor and unoptimized. I tend to ignore graphics so long as they don't royally suck. These are not great. You can tell this is a poorly done console port. This could potentially be excused if the gameplay was good, but that leads us to...  2.) The gameplay (after the first act) is dull and repetitious. The first act is done well. It hops around in time (like the cutscenes) and is scriped well. It's generally fun. Afterward, though, is a repetitious wreck. Basically, you shoot badguys and cause general havok in a specific area until the miniboss shows up. You kill him, do the shooting and havoking a second time until the second miniboss shows up. Kill him too. Then the district boss shows up. The boss levels are usually reasonably entertaining and it's clear THIS was where the real polish was done. Unfortunately you have to do this NINE TIMES. It's dull after the first few and the game doesn't really give you any good reason to want to do it again as all the districts are basically the same bunch of minigames with different settings. Even THIS would be excusable (somewhat) if the following wasn't true:  3.) The AI sucks chocolate salty balls. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst I've ever seen, but that's usually reserved for games that are broken. The AI does exactly what it's supposed to. Unfortunately, the AI is very very stupid. Case in point: run up to enemy location, hide around the wall from a bad guy, and whistle. It doesn't matter if you are on a construction site with a lot of civilian AI that's noisy as hell or a shack in the middle of the bayou; ONE SINGLE enemy will investigate. If you have two talking only ONE will investigate. If you run up to a group of five only ONE will investigate. They will ALWAYS investigate. Again, it doesn't matter where you are or if a whistle could conceivibly be a commonly heard sound. The AI will ALWAYS wander toward the sound like a sorority girl investigating a dark basement. They stroll toward you and practically BEG you to kill them. Rinse and repeat until someone finally sees you long enough for some arbitrary flag to fire and you are in unending combat.  4.) The police exist to do nothing but kill the PC. This is an extention of the prior but it needs an entry on its own. The police do not fight crime in New Bordeaux. They do not protect the innocent. They exist ONLY to kill a SINGLE PERSON: Lincoln Clay. If you get into a shootout with ANYONE and they respond, they will zero in on the PC like a AMRAAM. It doesn't matter who you're fighting or how many civilians are getting killed by the enemy's molotovs: if YOU are fighting they will try to kill YOU. There's also no system of justice either: shoot a civilian, get shot; shoot a car, get shot; shoot a mobster, get shot; break into a store, get shot; break into a telephone exchange, get shot; run over a pedestrian, get shot; lighly rearend a police car, get shot; walk too close to a cop, get shot. On the other hand, burning through a red light at 115 MPH, they don't bat an eye. Mafia I, which was released in 2002, had a VASTLY more sophisticated system of law and order. Let me repeat that: Mafia I, which is currently a FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD game, actually had a system where you had to follow the traffic laws and the cops wouldn't gun you down for a fender-bender. They also suffer from the ""GTA V effect"" and materialize from juuuust out of view and swarm you.  5.) After you finish off a ward, there's not really anything to do there. I can't fault Mafia III exclusively as this is generally a problem with open world games in general, but once you take over a ward there's not much point in ever setting foot there. It's interesting to see the businesses change when they change hands, but once you collect all the Playboys and Vargas drawings, there's not much reason to go back. This leads us to...  6.) The collectables are a tad-bit silly and really really pointless. I like vintage playboys and Vargas illustrations as much as the next man. However, this is because I am, in fact, a man. Enough said. However, this illustrates a further issue:  7.) There's not any particular ""advancement"" in the game. As far as I can tell, you are given all the clothing at the beginning of the game. This was rather disappointing to me as I hoped to unlock additional cosmetic features as I went along. This was not the case so I switched between looking like Laurence Fishburne in ""Apocalypse Now"" to Laurence Fishburne playing Malcom X to an extra from ""Shaft."" In addition, you have a large variety of weapons, that are pretty much ALL available at the beginning of the game, and are all pretty dull. The Colt 1911 was pretty much the same as the Browning 9mm which was pretty much the same as the Colt Python.  In conclusion (since I'm running low on space) the game is not really worth it IMO unless you enjoy doing the same thing over and over to really good music."
29524762,english,0,360430,"I loved Mafia 1 and Mafia 2... the gameplay in Mafia 3 was very lackluster. The game has been transformed to be a wannabe GTA, so if it's going to go there, it delivers poorly. It scratches the surface of gameplay elements we enjoy in similar-looking games like GTA, but with little freedom of choice and poor variety. I love the story idea but story alone is not enough to keep me playing until the end unless it really engages you with lead character development like in former Mafia titles. It's the same problem I have with recent Assassin's Creed games, although the AC games deliver tons of content but still manages to feel repetitive due to the side-quest nature of everything."
80666006,english,0,360430,"The story and characters are pretty good but once you've played the game for about an hour you've seen all it has to offer. Boring, repetitive and uninspired gameplay. You pick up fuses, wiretap a fuse box, maybe kill two targets and then take over a racket. That's the whole game."
45697992,english,1,360430,"[h1]Mafia lll[/h1]  Mafia lll has been a bit of a bumpy journey for me, good and bad, with mixed feelings. However, I feel the need to overall give this game a positive rating. I will go through the basics [i]without spoilers[/i] of the positive and negatives about this game.  [h1]Storyline/Cutscenes[/h1]  The setting takes places in a New Orleans fantasy during the Vietnam times, as you take place of a man named Lincoln Clay, who has returned from the war, and things turn nasty rather quickly. However, that's up to you to find out what happens.  The setting in this game is rather different than the other titles, this game does not much involved you much in the Mafia, however, you do deal with them still, just not like how it was like in the past.  The Cutscenes are good and bad at the same time. Some are just awesome, even with a gunfight with a sequence song playing in the background. However, some are just simple dialogue, where Lincoln stands still awkward, which is one of the drawbacks in the game because it's all the same when it happens. I'll get more into this at the end of my review.  Overall, the story is very good and engaging for me to continue playing the game. Each step of a territory taken with the people you are working with was one step closer to the climax. There will be a lot of gunfights, whether on foot and by car with police on your tail. The average time for me to finish the Campaign would have to be 20 hours, I did milk a lot with other side objectives and the DLC stories with my total of 40 hours.  [h1]Performance and Graphics[/h1]  Graphics are alright, but they do look like they aren't rendered correctly, and just look awful. I'm not picky with graphics, I mandatory Gameplay and Storylines more, especially for this type of game. However, sometimes the game does look damn beautiful, especially at night time. Textures would look weird, and the game just stutters bad, I MEAN BAD. IT EVEN RAINS WHEN ITS SUNNY OUT, CLEAR SKIES, IT TRIGGERS ME!   My system isn't the best, however, some people have been having issues, even with a system far better than mine. If you want a reference, I'm running High Settings with an FX 8320 and an RX 480 8GB with 16GB DDR3 average of 40-60, sometimes dipping lower with that terrible stuttering. Mafia lll is known to stutter a lot. I also had more massive stuttering occurs with a TV as a monitor when I got the game, however, it improved when I got a monitor. Again, it could be my system, however, the game has a lot of reports of lack of optimization, even on console.  Overall, if you can defeat the stutterings of eliminating it or dealing with it, you'll be fine.  [h1]The Progression and Side Activies[/h1]  Mafia lll is very, very, very repetitive, that was the one huge drawback I had about this game. It took me a long time to finish, however, taking breakers here and there, I was able to finish it eventually.   Basically here's how Mafia lll is in a nutshell:  > You go raid a place, shoot it up, steal money or break objects, interrogate this dude and repeat. > Or Chase this guy, kill him, and walk away.  You'll have certain targets to take down, which will be locked, you need to complete little strongholds or ""Operations"" in order to flush out the main person you need to take out. Again, repetitive.  Once you take down the Boss's or all Operations in a certain area or ""District"", you can choose who owns that, not going to spoil who, however.  After gaining more income, racking more to a certain District, you earn upgrades, such as guns, perks to help you such as reduce recoil, and health upgrades. You also get Hitman to assist you while in combat if needed. Cell phone jammers and car deliver, which vehicles also can be unlocked for an instant delivery. Yes, you can also upgrade your vehicles, however, nothing detailed, even less detailed than the last Mafia titles. However, I expect this honestly, I'm not too disappointed.  [U]Other Activies[/U]  You have other Activities, which include:  - Weed Operations (DLC Required: Faster Baby) - Hitman Jobs - Street Racing - Collectables such as Playboy's again - And a few more not mentioned...  Overall, the game does keep you occupied for a while, even without DLC, but Mafia lll is a game where it's all ""Fetch Quest"", which is again a huge drawback to me, and quite a few others.  [h1]My Final Summary[/h1]  [u]Simplified Pro's and Cons:[/u]  The Pros: - A very good story that was engaging to me. - A very good era, cars, location, music, it's all perfect. - Decent amount of activities - DLC's are decent as well if you have a chance to pick them up. - Awesome takedowns, I have to admit they never get old to do. - Alligators that eat you - Lincoln Clay a bad A$$ mother trucker  The Cons: - Repetitive asf - Optimization and Graphical issues - Some bugs happening where it requires a re-loading - Recycled Animations, such as Interrogations - Rather lacking the ""Mafia"" part. - ""Fetch based"" missions  Overall, the game is decent, not the worst, the game is rough. The story is good, the time/era and everything about it is awesome to me, I'm sure some may agree where I'm coming from. If you're able to by-pass the issues and actually play the game for the story and tolerate, completing the repetitive missions, I personally would say it's worth it. The DLC's aren't bad either to try, they will add more gameplay and new explorable locations and new characters to meet, but those will be separate reviews.  Is it the best Mafia game? No, not in my opinion, however, it's still good and exceptional. Well, is this worth Full Price? No, I honestly would highly recommend $15 at least, even better you can snag it with DLC at that price. When the game launched on its first good sale, I got the game and it's DLC for only $17!  Either way, Lincoln Clay has been fun to play as through my journey playing Mafia lll, even though it took my awhile to complete the story, I feel satisfied on the ending, and meeting some old friends."
50100294,english,0,360430,"When this game first came out, all I kept reading was how buggy it was. I chose not to get it, which was a shame because I was such a fan of the Mafia series to date, but I am not the type of person who can spend launch prices on a game and overlook bugs. So, instead, I waited. For a long, long... long... time. And I hate to say everyone, it was not in any way worth the wait.  I wanted to like this game. The characters all seemed really intriguing right from the start, and I was liking the environment a lot. But it took less than four hours of game-play to realize if I wasn't stuck in a repetitive task it was solely because the game had decided to thrust me into another unbearably long cut-scene, often right in the middle of combat. A few hours later, I found myself hitting an unskippable cut-scene, getting up, making my way downstairs, making a cup of tea, putting on the TV, and getting lost in a show entirely forgetting I was even playing this game only to come back to find my character standing there like a fool.  I need to be fair in this review and say I haven't finished it yet. But the reality is, I don't want to. I have no desire to boot it up anymore, I have no interest in launching into the game to drive to a location, whistle a few times, stealth kill everyone without any challenge, and then wait 25 minutes while the game tries to teach me a lesson about how messed up the US government used to be. It's just.. so...... boring."
94254649,english,1,360430,"This game gets hated on for it's repetitiveness, and rightfully so... But the game has a charm I can't quite figure out."
191556987,english,0,360430,"The current top review kinda says it all. This game should be in a neutral category. I usually keep refraining from writing reviews, but had to do it.   Although the setting is awesome and the racial tension is suspense, the gameplay and gameworld are lackluster. I like side missions, however you always have to drive through the ENTIRE map do complete them in Mafia 3. Which is not a problem in a game like GTA but here... To drive 5-10min in a barren landscape with heavy pop-in is just so.. boring.  The story starts off violently good. You get a reason, you get a narrative etc. But after two hours it just repeats itself. Drive to District A, kill everyone and capture the District. Drive to B, do the same all over again.  I don't leave games unplayed. Today I did."
77743457,english,0,360430,Bad optimization... the game got even worse after update to Definitive Edition
139797223,english,1,360430,Despite the fact that this game isnt popular with MAFIA fans (they hate this part actually) I pretty much enjoyed this part  1.One of the best soundtracks 2.1970's magnificant atmosphere 3.Face mimics and nice cutscenes  i would say its a OK Game  7.5/10
188164700,english,1,360430,"I enjoyed this game back in the days after its release and Im enjoying it even more now. Here is why. Previous two Mafia games were heavily story driven since you had one story mission after another. This one is closer to the classic ""GTA"" open world formula with many side missions to do (if you want).  I don't mind when games get repetitive if the gameplay itself is fun. And boy Im having fun with this one! The action, animations and ragdoll physics are so much fun that after finishing one firefight I can't wait to start another. One of my most favourite things are melee finishers. Simply get close to your enemy and press Q key and Lincoln  will perform a finisher depending on which weapon you are carrying. It was the exact same way (even the Q key) in 2005 Punisher game. You can also try stealthy approach or later in the game you can just call in a hitman squad and enjoy the firefight from afar. The choice is yours.  Story is actually very good and especially the acting. You just don't see a cutscene after every finished mission like in the previous games. Story narrative reminds me mostly of Guy Ritchie's gangster movies with little bit of Martin Scorsese mixed into it but at some points you also feel like being in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood since it takes place in the same time period and even contains  some songs that were later used in that movie.  Which brings me to the soundtrack - it's simply amazing. What can I say, one classic song after another. You will not want to turn off the radio station!  What about our main character Lincoln Clay? Im so happy that once more we can have some ""walking tank"" type of character. He is basically like Jack Reacher mixed with the Punisher. For a person like me who grew up on Arnold Schwarzenegger movies it's just another plus. And like a mentioned before the fighting and everything around it is just so much fun. Some people say that the open world is empty and there's not much to do except the side missions. To be fair it wasn't much different in previous games. Map basically served only to get from point A to point B to complete the story mission. In this you actually have things to do, which gives you more money, make things easier for you (like if you eliminate enemy enforcers they won't be bothering you later in the game) and your decisions even have influence on the story since there are several different ways how you can progress. Like in all previous instalments here as well was environment created with great attention to detail that makes you want to just walk around and breathe in the atmosphere. What makes the environment feel alive are the npcs. They have many different dialogs and even reacting on what's happening in the story as the game progress.  At one point after Sammy's bar gets repaired you can stop by to have a drink there which is a nice touch since I always liked to be able to immerse myself into the game doing all those little unnecessary things like being able to eat or drink and stuff like that. There is also one nice little detail some of us appreciate and which is usually overlooked in most pc games and that's the walking button. You can just switch between walk and run.  In case of technical issues - Im only having one. Which is that sometimes when you start the game it for some reason crashes back to desktop after the opening logos. Little annoying but all I have to do is just to start the game again and all over sudden it works just fine. I heard that switching the compatibility to Windows 7 solves the problem but I didn't bother to test it. Other than that game works just fine on max details. Not a single crash during the gameplay. My pc is almost as old as the game, which is Ryzen 5 1600, 16gb ram and GeForce 1060 (and Windows 10). Game can look gorgeous at times but I suggest turning off the depth of field and motion blur to make it look less blurry.  So If you like this genre I really think that you should give it a try. Im not afraid to say that this game is very underrated. It is on 75% sale very often and for that price you really can't go wrong.  You can pray on the way up! - Lincoln Clay  Update: I completely forgot that later in the game you can grow weed and even make your own strains! 10/10!"
187472933,english,0,360430,"The beginning was probably the best part of the game, it had story, action, deep moments and character development. Then AFTER the prolouge you go shoot a guy, rob a place and maybe even blow up a warehouse, sounds fun right? Now do that for every single god damn boss in the game :) There is also many bugs, light issues, crashes and even talking to a guy to start a mission won't work"
25915563,english,0,360430,"TL/DR: save yourself some time and money if you're new to the mafia franchise and buy mafia 2.  *UPDATED* for those interested review follows:  ♥♥♥♥ textures (muddy,grainy, blurry with some SERIOUSLY low res roads walls and general environment) that look like they were ripped straight out of Prototype (a game from 2008 WTF 2K?),   story is basically shadow of mordor set in new orleans (Same premise same gameplay BUT NOW WITH GUNS AND CARS! Boss mechanics and story points are basically ripped sraight from Shadow of Mordor along with the whole story being near identical... but being set in 1960's america) standard revenge storyline low stress,   I've noticed a whole lot of people commenting on the story of the game and how ""brave"" the developers were to take on a troubled era in American history (rampant racism being the main trouble) and while I might not have been alive in the 1960's (I'm 20) i do feel compelled to comment on the use of racism in this game: It appears that the use of racism is purely there as fluff to distract from the fact that the character interaction is really non-existent and very poorly written (probably in an attempt to make you feel something that the character fail to evoke) with completely forgettable characters being thrust forward and never actually developed or fleshed out. You can read more about them in the in game bio screens but from a pure storytelling perspective they are basically flat hollow mission givers with no real reason to care about them or Lincoln's straight Shadow of Mordor campaign or even Lincoln himself! I personally couldn't tell you a damn thing about any of the characters I met during my 5/6 hours with the game and that's a real shame.  rinse and repeat missions (There's so ♥♥♥♥ING MANY of these they got boring and repetitive extremely quickly), often recycling the same layouts and environments for different ""missions"" even enemy placements have very little variation,  crap controls (mouse acceleration with no off switch? c'mon guys that's just lazy/no working key rebind system? ♥♥♥♥ sake),   *FIXED* 30FPS lock out of the box (I know its been said like a million times but it matters),   HOWEVER this now presents the issue pertaining to maintaining a consistent 60fps this game running on my system on high reaches 40fps with the fps locked to 60 NOW i would like to take the time to outline the system that this game is running on:  Intel Core i7 5960X @ 4.5 Ghz 16 GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum at 2400 Mhz 2 EVGA GTX 980 ti's 6GB in SLI (the system req's call for a single 290X or 780 from 2013...) Samsung 850 Evo Pro 1TB All sitting on a ASUS Rampage V Extreme All custom watercooled  this system should eat this game up and spit it the ♥♥♥♥ out 3 times over ESPECIALLY as it runs Witcher 3 on ultra at a solid 60FPS without breaking a sweat, this brings the issue up of just poor optimisation for the PC platform and explains why they didn't put full 60 on from the start. PC was an afterthought, a cliff note, a ""oh ♥♥♥♥ we forgot do that"" moment and thats not right we bought the game same as everyone else treat us with at least a little ♥♥♥♥ing respect you did willfully take our money.   no SLI support,   menu's are a joke, blurry aliased text (if you play at a res higher than 1080p) CLEARLY designed for controllers not a mouse and keyboard (as in it has no mouse input at all apart from in maybe the new game section but still displays the cursor),  if you want to play in 21:9 good luck dealing with all the artifacting that comes with it (lighting bugs, discolouration, interface designs e.g the low health blood that appears only covers a 16:9 space...) including a rave party at the edges of the screen whenever you go indoors (spoiler alert you might have to do that quite a bit),   texture pop in is a MAJOR issue with this game along with a HIDEOUS draw distance that means things get properly rendered when they're 10 ft away (by rendered i of course mean that the textures just pop into existence extremely noticeably)   enemies take 1/2 to a full mag to kill if not shot in the head and even then its not a sure thing (the ♥♥♥♥ am I fighting luke cage? I was playing the game on medium btw mother ♥♥♥♥ers take 7 shots in the chest and keep walking)  the police system that was in mafia 2 has been stripped down to cops shoot on sight if you run a red light (what happened to the fine/arrest/shoot/wanted system?)  cover system works well if not a little temperamental on occasion  shooting felt fine but i found myself constantly running out of ammo due to the aforementioned Luke Cage esque enemies  sneak felt like beating up on quadriplegic kids because the AI is legit totally incapable of seeing you crouched in front of them  driving is either PEDAL TO THE METAL or FULL STOP there is no in between and you'll spend most of your time wrestling for control of the car (the game then has the cheek to offer you ""simulation driving"" to make is harder... what were they thinking...)  the standard formula of go here kill this was a common theme... wait ... the only theme that ran though this game and the story only gave context (sometimes it's really paper thin) as to why you are doing what your doing  the game also has these kind-of not cutscenes but cutscenes where you and the person you're meeting with stand awkwardly and wooden with dialogue playing overtop it (this happens WAY more than it should) normally preceeding you going to a place and shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of it like 90% of the other missions that Clay will be undertaking  lastly the options menu is a disaster the graphics settings seem to do nothing to the look of the game having swapped from high to low and low to high the only real difference I could see was the ambient occlusion was missing on the low preset but texture difference is basically non existant (Im starting to think that low and high are the same thing in the config file)  huge disappointment was a game that i was really looking forward to... :(  UPDATE: Steam won't refund me my money so i guess it's only fair that IF (< big if) any of this ♥♥♥♥ gets fixed i will update this review accordingly"
138356843,english,0,360430,"Gameplay wise this game is literally just 35+ hours of doing the same exact thing over and over again. Story wise, it’s decent but just doesn’t feel like a Mafia game, it feels more like a spin-off."
25900757,english,0,360430,"This game isnt exactly a game of the year in my opinion, but ill make a list below of positives and negatives. Remember, these are only my opinions.  [h1]Positive[/h1] [list]     [*]Story seems quite interesting     [*]Gunplay is really fun     [*]Map seems okay     [*]I really like the trash talk of AI     [*]Some animations are really good, almost amazing.     [*]Being able to drive up with a pink beetle, murder enemy enforcer then driving away with pink beetle while they are shootin at you. [/list]  [h1]Negative[/h1] [list]     [*]Driving feels like you are driving on ice and all cars feel like supercars     [*]I really hate games nowdays that make the game challenging by making enemies bullet sponges.  Once I shot one guy 4 times in the upperbody and he didnt die...     [*]Lack of customization. Remember when you could buy clothing in Mafia II? Or customize your car? Well not anymore. You can upgrade your car's performance and thats about it.     [*]Icons floating and showing where weapons, cash and every other collectible things are.     [*] It is really easy. Havent died once yet.. When you are close to dying just run behind cover or pump some adrenaline into you and you are good to go.     [*]Car damage models are horrible.     [*]Cars sound like beefed vacuumcleaners.     [*]Lincoln having that stupid superpower that is plaguing every game nowdays. Seeing trough walls and enemies glowing bright red.      [*]Lincoln doesnt have any animations or ragdoll when he is hit by a car. If a car hits you, you will slide with the car untill you slide off front of the car. [/list] Overall it feels too arcady for me. Only thing that I play it for now is the story. The game itself spoils a lot of the story but I want to see what happens.  I will play it but wont enjoy it as much as Mafia II"
77013818,english,0,360430,"There is not a single reason to call this game ""Mafia"". There are no families, loyalty, fancy clothes, cars or betrayal. There is no proper story, and the game is very repetitive. You go some place, kill everyone, deal damage and kill the boss, thats all. The open world is so dead, AI is very stupid, both the henchman and normal people driving around the city. Car mechanics are very bad, there is no car damage at all. Graphics are bad, blurry. To be honest, this game has the best licenced I've heard for a while, its like they spent all the money for the music, instead of developing the game."
36538437,english,0,360430,"Some pros and cons after few hours in game.  Pros: - Characters, interesting and with deep backstories - Sound is excellent - Location has so much to offer - Open world without loading screens - Interesting gameplay mechanics - Inspired by the blaxploitation movies for sure  Cons: - Boring AF - Bugs everywhere - It's not a MAFIA story, it's just a ""generic revenge story"" with mobs - territories and mafia wars are a simple copy-paste from The Godfather 2 game - You can't collect cars, or houses or clothes but the game wants you to become the richest gangster in the USA - 'whistle', ""who's there?"", kill the guy in stealth mode, go on with other 5000 henchmen  It's not a full no no, it's a ""meh, what a wasted opportunity"""
64130379,english,0,360430,"The first 2 hours in this game is amazing, it feels like it could win the GOTY title because of its masterful storytelling and character shaping, I enjoyed it very much and felt like I was watching a nice movie.  But the game got the mixed reviews for a reason. It quickly becomes repetitive after you're allowed to free roam in the city. Literally every mission you do is to go to a spot to kill & interrogate certain targets and then receive further information and go to the next spot doing the exact same thing until you finally liberate all the districts for your 3 underbosses which is pretty much everything this game has to offer, it really feels like a chore to do and many people hate it because of that.   But the game starts to get a little bit more interesting again after I liberated the first 3 districts. At least now there are races I can do and I get to modify my cars, it's fun because the driving (and the shooting) in this game feels pretty good. But srsly I dunno what they were thinking, the races are not available at first, you have to grind through the first 10+ hours of the game in order to be able to race. I believe the majority of the players just quit before they even know there are races in the game.  Overall I think this game could've been so much better, the demo back in 2015 looks so good that it's hard not to be sold on the game, I dunno what happened later that could make the game so different from what it looked like in the demo, maybe the lack of money? It's such a shame."

Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales.  This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me."

It had an actual story, interesting characters, it was even funny at times, and I couldn't understand why the rating was so low. But then the prologue ended, and shit hit the ceiling. You suddenly have to do the exact same thing over and over again. Go there, kill this guy, move over there, kill this guy... over and over and over and over and over again. It's like the definition of insanity, and it's a pity, because the prologue was really promising. Still, the game has its moments (if you can survive the repetitive boredom), great characters and voice acting, and an awesome soundtrack (though even that starts to piss you off after a couple of hours listening to the same song). I'd rather not say anything about the graphics."

30516624,english,0,360430,"The gameplay gets very repetitive after a while. The story is great and I only spent 27 hours playing this game because of the story. It's so sad to see a Mafia game end up a disappointment like this since this game had a lot of potential and could've been so much more. I would not recommend this game at full price, it's a joke to pay 60 bucks for such a repetitive and boring gameplay that will keep you entertained for 2-3 hours at the most.  The game only shines at story telling and that alone is not worth its price."
83600002,english,0,360430,"Mafia III: Definitive Edition is an action-adventure open-world game. You are Lincoln Clay, a former criminal and Vietnam veteran. You are forced to return to a life of crime to help your family settle problems with the local Mafia family. It does not take long and the Mafia betray and murder your family, so you are going on a quest for revenge. Over time Lincoln is slowly building a criminal empire.  On its release Mafia III was full of bugs, over time it was patched and was good in terms of performance but then came the Definitve Edition upgrade... Now the game is riddled with graphical bugs, sound bugs (ALT+TAB removed the sounds for me), cut scenes are sometimes not working, some characters which should have opened a door for me to proceed stucked and I had to reload the checkpoint, and the performance overall is worse compared to the former version. The graphics are good. The music is also good and fits to the time, however there could be more songs in the radio (you can listen to radio channels, like in GTA). The characters and the story are uninteresting from my point of view. It does not feel like playing in the Mafia world. The game (especially in the later part) is pretty boring and annoying. The missions are totally repetetive (interrogate a person, destroy that and that and kill a special guy...repeat). So, I actually wished that the game was shorter, as it was a torture to do the same stuff again and again. Mafia III: Definitive Edition is a disapointment. I recommend Mafia II or GTA series, but this game is not worth 29,99 € at all.

149999173,english,0,360430,"A Funny Story   The place named New Bordeaux in the game is Saint Denis in Red Dead Redemption 2, and this is one of the reasons why RDR2 was postponed. The name of the city in the game was originally going to be New Bordeaux, but they changed it to Saint Denis.  Because the name of this city name was already used in Mafia 3 and since Rockstar did not want to use this name, they decided to completely change the name of the city.  Some of the new additions are nice, but overdoing it and straying from the main path of the series must have killed the game, and also the optimization is still a disgrace.  But unfortunately, since there are some small good details, I can never praise such a game because this game is completely a hideout cleaning simulator and it makes you repeat the same thing over and over, it is literally a disgrace and very boring."
55049510,english,1,360430,"I really enjoyed Mafia 3, and this is coming from someone that has also played Mafia 2. There seems to be a lot of criticism towards this game, which is a shame because it's honestly not terrible. The gameplay is repetitive, sure. Plenty of features appear under-cooked and the world could've used some more activities. But these things really didn't bother me - for everything Mafia 3 does wrong, it makes up for it with a stellar soundtrack, vibrant setting, good characters and overall decent storytelling. It's not on Mafia 2 levels by any means, but it isn't nearly as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. I thought Lincoln was a fine protagonist, he suits the ""revenge story"" avenger-role well - and has some of the most memorable appearances in cutscenes.  Speaking of cutscenes, they're beautifully directed and could almost stand on their own as a short film series of sorts. Each set-piece is brutal and memorable. The documentary bits with Father James were great, as were Lincoln's meetings with Donovan. Plenty of cinematic symbolism and great camera angles interspursed with historical imagery. Sure, they're pre-rendered CGI, but I still loved them regardless. M3's motion capture is excellent too, adding to the emotional impact in cutscenes.  If you're going to get this game for one reason, get it for the side content, which is where M3 is at its best I think. It has an original score, which is excellent, and a varied radio selection with plenty of iconic artists from the period ranging from blues, soul, country, and psychedelic/garage rock. I also really enjoyed the collectibles, they evoke Mafia 3's setting well and are fun to read through. The inclusion of character bios was also appreciated; the amount of written content in M3 is honestly immense. Smaller content like the handwritten notes you'd find in racket hideouts also really added to the atmosphere. Lincoln's journal gives you a further insight into his experiences throughout the plot.  Speaking of rackets, I actually really enjoyed this mechanic. As you progress through the story and take over districts, it actually feels like you're tearing away at a rival criminal enterprise and are taking over from the inside. The racket missions are nothing to write home about, but still provide a way to make extra money after the main story. Each safehouse is detailed and distinctive, and populated with NPCs, providing a place to bunker down if you're being pursued by the police and supplying you with extra adrenaline shots and body armor. Cash also serves a purpose in gameplay, and you'll want to store it in your safe as soon as possible. If you die without depositing your cash, you will lose some of it. This ensures you aren't careless with your supplies and gives a sense of urgency. It's best to deposit all of your cash before tackling some of the more difficult enemy safehouses.  I also thought the ""marker"" and services system was great because it means you have a reason to complete side missions for each underboss and remain loyal. You'll want to complete these early in the game and save up your service markers, because you will certainly be needing them - like the ability to halt police pursuits, hijack the phone lines so witnesses can't call for the police, and call for hitmen to aid you in combat. Each racket has a clear and defined difficulty curve as you progress through the story - I never once had to adjust the difficulty setting, which I've had to deal with in plenty of other games with ""artificial"" rises in difficulty where it starts to feel cheap. This was never an issue for me in M3.  [h1]TL;DR - Recommended,[/h1] get this game (perhaps on a sale though). I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it, despite its flaws."
25930497,english,1,360430,"Game is 30fps, yes but one of the smoothest 30fps i've experienced in a PC game. The open world is as basic as it gets, but who is here for the open world aspect really? The combat is the games best feature and its pretty satisfying compare to other open world game. The gunplay is already better than your GTAV gunplay. Theres complaints about the enemies A.I, which ive experienced some dumb moments. Enemies all reacting the same and make the same bad decisions, even breaking aggressive approaches in combat while in a gun fight, to go into stealth A.I animation with my character right in front of clear view.   Honestly the game feels like a early access game. I found out that the devs will be adding the option to change characters clothes after the game launch? sign of a rushed game? I've so far small glitches. The graphics are hit and miss, but its decent.   The story is top-notch.   As much as i want my 60fps, i can't deny that this game isnt fully playable. i've had similar bad experience with batman arkham knights and even witcher 3 at launch. The experience for these games got better as the patches rolled in, so i expect the same for this.   The game is pretty playable and worth owning, be it now or later. Its just going to take some patch work, as with many games on the pc, to reach full potential.  PS: I think the devs made some pretty bad mistake with this game. I wish i could of lend some ideas for the game. game has lost potential."
91458320,english,0,360430,"The game was fine before they added the 2K launcher. Now when you click to start game, you get a launcher than supposedly contacts 2K servers, and checks something (no permission from the user requested).  So you click to get launcher, click to start game, wonder about what the launcher (which wasn't necessary before) is doing in the background, and then click to exit game, and exit the launcher.  At what point did the devs in that company sit around a table and decide that this was what the game needed? I'd recommend their company gets some serious devs. The type that slim down the crap and maximise the gaming experience.  Uninstalled. Shame. Bought it a few months ago, and the game was largely fine, if occasionally buggy. If this is them sorting it, the code must have been seriously messed up, and the new devs were even more useless. Hope you read this devs. Be ashamed of yourselves.  DO NOT BUY."

Now it's a bunch of go and kill or interrogate ""Jerry"" with no purpose behind it. This game had a great start and it feels unfinished and rushed to be honest. Go spend your money elsewhere."

[*]Incredibly repetitive gameplay     [*]Needlessly difficult achievements, since certain counters reset at every restart of the game     [*]Missing details that were present in Mafia I and II, which made the game much more immersive (e.g. police chasing you if you drive too fast) [/list] I think I could go on a bit longer.  And the worst of it, all of these issues appear to have already been present in the original Mafia III game, and nobody bothered to fix any of it in the Definitive Edition.  The idea of the game is not bad in terms of its story, but the way this game is designed is just incredibly boring and annoying. Huge downgrade from the 2 previous games if you ask me. It hurts to say it, since I really liked the Mafia series so far, but I just can't recommend this game to anyone."
70437460,english,0,360430,"The game itself is good, but tedious. Drive, talk to somebody, drive to the place they asked and shoot they guy they asked, then repeat. Also, the PC port is horrendous.

101094548,english,1,360430,"Having played the other Mafia games, I personally really enjoy this one. Is it my favourite? Not necessarily. However, I really loved the story and I found myself very attached to the characters. I found that they were all pretty unique, and I was thoroughly pleased to see Vito make an appearance. I will someday replay the game to see how it plays out with the other characters being in charge, but for now I'm satisfied.  I understand the frustration behind doing virtually the same task for each district, which is killing mob bosses and or interrogating them, destroying rackets, etc. At one point it was annoying but I did realise that it did have a significance to the story of the game, to some extent. They could've made that part more interesting, maybe have some unique scenarios for the different districts, and they could've also used different player models! I found it strange that the same henchmen that I killed were suddenly revived and working for the racket I just secured... strange. With the definitive edition I found that there were a few graphical glitches that took away from the immersion of driving aesthetically pleasing muscle cars whilst listening to 60s rock. Some cut scenes occasionally caused the game to freeze, which became a nuisance at times.  I would still recommend this to someone who hasn't played it, and I agree that it isn't for everyone, but I really like the liberty of completing different missions instead of only doing the main story, and just senselessly killing racists in freeroam. It definitely doesn't follow the traditional Mafia game progression but I can still appreciate the length of the story. If you're looking for something that resembles the previous Mafia games you may be disappointed. I think it's still worth a try, especially at its discounted price."

26027640,english,0,360430,"I've played through the game twice, A majority of my playing time is offline thus my hours aren't reflecting actual time in-game.  Good game but still feels as though we're being guided along the rails. This feels like a step back from Mafia 2. No clothes shops, no car workshops, no gas stations. Graphics were pretty blah out of the box, but after the patch that unlocked FPS and a ReShade preset, the game looks pretty good on a 1070 GTX. It ran consistently, based on the Steam overlay, at 56-57 FPS.  Pros:  -Little details - reactions to PC, witnesses calling in crimes, etc. The city feels alive.  -Environmental/Weather system (people use umbrellas when it's raining, streets get wet when it rains, and they gradually dry after rains)  -Story is very good  -Voice acting is exceptional  Cons:  -Weather system - sometimes it rained for days at a time, and weather changed far too abruptly at times.   -Side missions to increase racket income are repetitive and tedious. This is where a lot of time in the game will be spent as objectives are clear on the other side of the map from you.  -Enemy and Police AI needs some serious attention. Enemies were completely inept unless it was a scripted event. As far as police: No speeding tickets, I could ram into cars all day in front of police but if I accidentally bumped a civilian a 5 state all points bulletin happened.   -Motorist AI is horrendous. I experienced huge traffic jams in some areas of the city which made some missions impossible to complete.  -Buggy:  Had dual Cassandras and Burkes when I did the last of their personal missions, boats spawing on land, cars I needed to steal blowing up for no apparent reason before I could get to them. Disappearing icons - being told to go talk to so and so (while doing racket earning missions) and not being able to as the icons didn't appear on the map. My ""GPS"" path displayed would bug out occasionally turning into some super wide path that was impossible to follow, and many more.  -Unless you're a completionist, there's zero replay value. As stated above, racket earnings missions are extremely tedious and that alone is reason for me not to want to touch this game again.  -Locations get reused. ""Hey kill a pimp here.."" 30 minutes later, hey the boss is so dumb he went back to the same location the pimp was at. Kill him there."" With so many locations possible, this is just pure laziness.  -Different endings but really doesn't feel like it means much, because there's nothing after the little ending spiels. What happened to ""open world games"" letting the player continue playing after the main story is finished? This game could be so much more..  -DLC: First DLC, through free, offered outfits that should have shipped with the game.  tl;dr Good game if you're a ""one and done"" player. If you're looking for replay value I'd wait and see what future patches and/or DLC offer. As of now I can't recommend the game. It's buggy, should have never shipped with a 30 fps lock for PC players, and feels more hollow than it's predecessor.   *review edited to reflect release of first DLC*"

The mission design is also repetitive that you better use a mod to reduce those tasks. Also, no fast travel in this open world, especially when I want to get back to the herb house for money. Finally, it really needs a manual save to load when you make mistakes or something. It could've been great, but 2K and Hangar 13 fcked it up with their laziness to fix it.

92753278,english,0,360430,"I first bought this game about 1.5 year ago, back when it was still just your regular Mafia 3 and not the illustrious Mafia 3: Definitive Edition. I actually liked it more than most - yeah, it was repetitive and some of the design choices I found just baffling, but still... it was fun enough to keep me going. Until, that is, I ran into a vicious little gamebreaking bug that caused my game to freeze on an infinite loadscreen.   Got frustrated, got over it, uninstalled the game, thinking I might give it another shot should they ever patch it up.   So, yeah, it's been a year and a half. Did they fix it?  Nope.   Real fuckin' definitve, guys."
134945692,english,0,360430,"One of the rare times where I wish Steam had a neutral recommendation. I think the story is a great idea on paper and the actual cutscenes, radio tunes and voice acting is pretty good. I love the idea of a mob revenge story set during the civil rights era where you play as a guy taking back his city, racket by racket, to avenge those close to him who were killed by the Italian mafia. It's way different than the first two games in tone, now you have more than just an opposing mob and the police force after you, you have actual racist, hate groups, Haitians and corrupt politicians as well. It feels serious, yet I cannot say the gameplay does the story and tone justice. Like everyone has said at this point, it is REPETITIVE. The majority of these missions play out exactly like this: drive to a district to talk to an NPC about a nearby racket that an enemy has conjured up, go to the same three mission types in the district and complete them till the game says you caused enough damage in funds to that racket, then go back to that same NPC and they will give you the exact location of the person who ran that racket, then go back to one of the mission areas you already completed and kill that guy, you take control over the racket, mission completed. Do that about fifteen or so times to take over the entire county and maybe you'll get a fun mission or two. There is optional missions, but these play out the same way, deliver this vehicle and kill this guy, literally all of them! And the thing is, the actual shooting and driving is fine, but it's just so boring seeing the same death animations, the same buildings, the same enemies over and over! Don't get me wrong, there is fun to be had, these repetitive missions weren't boring at first. It was just when I realized after a few hours of taking over rackets, that was almost the entire game! I wanted variety just like the first two games had. There was driving missions, sneaking missions, missions where you had to exclusively go in guns blazing and maybe a few that combined these elements in one big mission. I will also admit that these games didn't go out on the open world aspect, but it was for the better, because look at Mafia 3's version. I would be surprised if anyone actually liked this one over the previous two games. The actual story missions are decent, they have great cutscenes and I love the interactions between characters. Actually going inside a different building or area was a breath of fresh air. It was awesome seeing Vito again and working alongside him throughout the game. The problem is, they come way too far in between the racketeering junk. A big smack in the face? The DLCs have better mission designs! ""Faster, Baby!"" is the best one because you can destroy an entire county with this bada** vehicle and create your own weed strains, it's cool and the story for it is action packed all the way. Final thoughts: Mafia 3 is a disappointment and basically junk food. It's every mediocre open world game, Frankenstein stitched together with an interesting story and a 60's setting."
182893924,english,0,360430,"Mafia III is a game where you go from point A to point B to shoot a lot of guys before going back to point A to talk to a person to go shoot some more guys, usually ending in a mildly interesting set piece mission.  It's been done a thousand times before, and it's not what people come to play the Mafia series for."
161988765,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 has both positive and negative aspects. A game that everyone had great hopes for.  ✅Soundtrack - the music is perfectly matched to the game, which takes place in 1968, ✅the story of the main character - memorable, allowing you to feel the role of a person who only wants revenge, ✅supporting characters - their presentation and manner of being in the game add an interesting atmosphere, ✅ prologue and story missions - a very interesting and engaging prologue that allows you to feel the atmosphere and story missions done at a very high level, ✅shooting system - we have pistols, rifles, snipers, shotguns and several unique weapons at our disposal. Perfect refinement of shotgun shooting, you can feel that you have a strong weapon.   ➖side missions - repetitive, interesting at the beginning, but after a few hours of gameplay boring and tiring, ➖ damage to vehicles - after hitting another vehicle at high speed, there is not much damage, but after hitting bushes or a fire hydrant, our vehicle is no longer suitable for driving, ➖NPCs - we are often lost by enemies, fighting them in some locations is very simple, there is no challenge at all, ➖police - I miss tickets for speeding or road collisions, the police in Mafi 3 are practically useless."
166578693,english,0,360430,"Honestly it's more of a meh for me. The story is interesting and funny, but is overshadowed by the repetitive game-play, go here kill this guy, than go kill these group of guys and get a main mission about killing this main guy. That is the entire game-play cycle, start to finish. The endings are honestly lackluster, and leave a lot to be desired.   I would recommend you pick it up in sale, third party, or at least buy the trilogy which would net you more bang for your buck. A cool concept and great story weighed down by horrible game-play."
92491256,english,1,360430,This game is good game with good and bad points I want say bad points in first place and explain how much this game is underrated Bad points are  1)fps drops and few bugs(i didnt see any crashes in my exprience) 2) repetitive missions if u want just finish story in fastest time(just play dlcs and side missions beside main missions till dont tired from main missions) 3)poor graphic and textures Good points: 1)amazing story and characters with great acting that u cant forget them for long time 2)musics 3)driving system 4)ending missions and enjoyable dlcs 5)variety of weapons and ways u can finish missions I cant understand this much of hating for this great game.i think 8/10 can be good score for this game
163197022,english,1,360430,"Ignore the hate about this game, It's actually all-around GREAT. To me it's definitely a #Top10 Revenge-driven story I have ever played. It has a very compelling story line with very creative cinematics and crucial choices to be made that dictate the ending. The cars, the driving and combat physics, the in game music? - Almost Perfect. Including the DLCs this game is a FUN TIME above everything else, enthusing, controversial and brutal, anyone who says otherwise is a liar. - 10/10"
122396465,english,0,360430,"I finally managed to play this game, and finish it as well. Although I must admit I had fun playing it, I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone who does not know the Mafia game lore. If you have not played the previous games, this game is not for you, and if you played them, the ocassional nostalgia is what keeps you going. What I mean by that are the following positives of this game: + The story of the game is interesting, the protagonist is very well picked and introduced.  + You meet Vito Scaletta, the protagonist of Mafia 2, and if you're lucky, you might meet more Mafia 2 characters + Since I played the Definitive edition I had access to all DLCs which were interesting both story and content-wise +Stealth in this game is amazing, whether it's the silencer or takedowns, also throwing knives as dlc content were an awesome addition + The soundtrack is very good. I think that this pretty much sums up the positive aspects of the game for me personally, so let's move on to the negatives:  - As soon as I started the game, I had to try multiple options in the settings for the game to be playable. This game has been released long enough, there should've been some kind of a patch already to fix this, because playing on lowest settings is really hard to look at an unable to play with. - The game crashed rarely, but it crashed indeed.  - GPS has a mind of its own. If the mission allows multiple targets as a choice and I pick the closest one, I expect the gps to stay focused on that point without changing it to a further one. Why should I go from Point Verdun all the way to the Bayou if what I'm looking for can also be found in Point Verdun?  - More customization options, but worse customization options.  - The game is very much repetitive. If I didn't have the DLCs to change it up a bit, I would get bored much easier and quicker, which I eventually did after I finished the DLCs.   This game is actually not that bad, it has a hidden potential, but it also has many many things that need to be fixed. It is playable, it is mildly enjoyable, but it is mostly repetitive and unstable."
165231026,english,1,360430,"I get why people like it less than the other Mafia games, as it's very dissimilar. It's more of a Grand Theft Auto than anything else. The mission are repetitive indeed, and the enemy NPC's are basically walking practice dummies, but it is what it is - 50+ hours of casual fun. Loved the setting, rarely have I seen a city so well reproduced. The story itself, the diverse cast of side characters and backgrounds, and the music, were all excellent. I loved it, might not be everyone's cup of tea but I've enjoyed it just as much as I've enjoyed GTA games back in the day."
79765478,english,1,360430,"It plays like it came out in 2009 vs. 2016, but I'd recommend a play through anyway.  You have 2 choices of play style: Sneak or shoot em' out. If you sneak, there is a huge flaw in game mechanics. Each enemy will ""search"" for you and follow the exact same path the last one did allowing you to essentially stand there and knife them one by one until the whole place is empty. Boring, right? If you don't stand there, the enemies are still on this one path of searching and it just messes the game up. I suggest just shooting em. Go in with guns for the most part.   Story is great and the cut scenes don't drag out, however, it does become a sort of grind after several hours. Reminds me of GTA - drive over here, kill this person, drive back. Drive here.. etc etc.   Still recommend on sale as a time-consuming open world game."
118420123,english,0,360430,"I actually like this game but I can't recommend because it is very poorly optimized for PC and runs like garbage. The story is decent and the game play is ok but does get highly repetitive. Play this one on console if you have to, it's a much better experience"
25911615,english,0,360430,"Updated: This is not an acceptable game for 2016. The amount of glitches, repetitiveness, and lack of other missions, and jobs to do after you complete the story is poor. Mafia 3 tried hard to bring back the Mafia series, but it crashed and burned. I had so much hope for this game, but it turned out to be another No Man's Sky of 2016.  Original Post Below: This great video by CrowbCat shows the many things wrong with Mafia III PC version. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  This is what happens when you give a good game series to a different developer who has no idea on how to make proper video games. I had so high hopes for this game, but I was let down once again by the gaming industry.  This game is so awful. When I decided to play on PC, it was because I have a choice. I could choose my hardware, my software, my resolution, my framerate, and my graphics, but what Hangar 13 did is unacceptable. They locked the game to 30FPS, and their reason for that is: ""The team has been hard at work ensuring that Mafia III’s performance is consistent across all platforms, and right now the game runs at a solid 30 frames-per-second.""   That's the most bullshit I have ever heard in one sentence. Mafia III for PC is a console port. The game has so many problems when it comes to reflections, lighting, and no SLI support. The antialiasing just blurs the game to make the edges look better, the PC controls are horrendous, and the game is being upscaled from 720p. It's so damn hard to focus on the story aspect when the screen is tearing, the graphics are glitching out, things pop in at ridiculous distance, but wait, they are releasing a patch to make the game run over 60FPS, and fix the issues. Too late, you already screwed up the game's launch, and what you have done will not be forgotten. They did release the patch to unlock the framerate, but since they never optimized the game good, it still runs like shit. This was my birthday present, and it's the worst fucking birthday present I have ever gotten. Hangar 13 didn't deliver on their promise on putting time, and effort into their PC version. You had 5 fucking years to sort all this shit out, but you didn't. Nice job Hangar 13, you made a sequel to Mafia II worse.  Don't buy this game."
179728001,english,0,360430,"[i]As a first time player.[/i]  Mafia III nails the 1960s vibe with a detailed city and an incredible soundtrack that immerses you in its world. The first few hours are cinematic and gripping, but the excitement quickly fades.  I hate writing reviews without finishing games, but this one is boring af. It doesn’t make you feel like you’re part of the Mafia, instead dragging you into repetitive side quests that block progress to the main story. Cool unlocks, are locked behind tedious grind sessions. And without a fast travel system, getting around the massive city becomes a tedious time sink.  A promising start derailed by frustrating design choices."
182762819,english,0,360430,"Its just rinse and repeat. All the missions are the exact same thing with zero variation. The first few hours were so strong and I bet the story is amazing, but they extended the game 20 too long which is very evident from the idiotic mission design. Its just time wasting. Guess, Ill watch the cutscenes on Youtube as there is no way i'm spending 30 hours or so doing the exact same thing over and over again, Its insane."

Positive elements, noted by me:  - ""fatalities"" - lethla\non-lethal, depending on walking\running and weapon in your hands. Looks smooth and brutal. - Some characters are really interesting. - DLC missions are the best ones in the entire game (lol), excluding the prologue. There are more, but they are inconspicuous.  Should say special hate for critical bugs: - Cars' tires can't live longer than 20 seconds in chases. I mean all 4 tires will be broken after 20 seconds of any chase and enemies don't even need to shoot. Can you imagine how it makes impossible any chases? Can't even say how it is ridiculous. - Pedestrians-kamikadze. I think 80% of pedestrians choose the wrong direction to dodge your car and jump right under your tires. Funny? No, because there are cops (see previous bug). And because your car reacts to it inadequately.  Any words about seamless grind are unnecessary. Just avoid it in every possible way (I used cheats). Also, I liked music."

25900160,english,0,360430,"Nevermind the 30 FPS. (Fixed in patch 1.01)  - No saving, only one constantly overwriting checkpoint system. Want to re-play a mission or go for different decision? Well, you better start the game all the way from the start again then. - Contains a ton of incredibly lazy and boring, unskippable cutscenes where Clay talks with one of the minor story characters. All of them shot from exactly same camera angle, which never moves, and neither do the characters. They give no info related to the main story and did I mention they are unskippable. - Hold [DEL] as a default keybind. (Default keybindings have been improved in patch 1.01) - Game fails to detect native screen resolution. Was set 1600 x 900 on my 1920 x 1080 screen. - In-game options can't handle using Steam overlay. Enabling and then disabling Steam overlay while options menu is on closes the option menu, even if you are in middle of making changes. - Rolling menus, yes, you must wait for the menu to roll past Kill list, Assets, Journal tabs to get to Options. - All weapon stats in percentages, including ammo capacity. Freaking love these revolvers with 15% and semi auto pistols with 31% ammo capacity. - Mouse sensitivity settings are a mess. Mouse sensitivity in menus is extremely high, bringing sensitivity down to usable levels in menus brings in-game sensitivity to unusably low. Menu mouse behaviour also suffers from mouse de-acceleration. - The game has a backlighting profile for Logitech RGB keyboards, which only makes things worse. Just three red vertical stripes, does not illuminate keys that are actually bound for gameplay functions. - Lock opening QTE gets repetitive and old really fast. - Looks horrible because everything on screen is softened/blurred so heavily. For example faces at about 20 meter distance are blurred into solid brown blobs. No sharpness anywhere. No combination of graphics settings seems to fix this. - Death and money mechanics. When you die, instead of ""loading last save"" you lose 50% of your money and you continue with whatever ammunition you had when dying. Respawned with 5 ammo on the pistol and 3 on SMG. -> Go buy more ammo before getting back to action. - Camera positions when driving are way too low. There are near, medium and far camera positions, but none of them actually are set high enough to be properly able to see in front of you. This also adds to the bad looking graphics when ground textures are viewed from a flattened angle. - Deadlocked traffic jams that break ""follow that car"" missions. - Badly executed subtitles where long blocks of text are often cut in middle of sentences and the timings are off.   Mafia III manages to implement usability problems I've never even seen before. It is incredible that they have managed to put effort into making things worse from usability point of view.  Update: Nomimated for The “Failure to live up to expectations set by previous games in the series and made me regret having enough brand loyalty to pre-order it” Steam Award"
137642489,english,0,360430,The game is really bad. The district mechanics are very repetitive and thus boring. The game is more reminiscent of a Splinter Cell or Assassins Creed with repetitive tasks. The graphics are not to my taste either. The city is not very original. Everything looks kind of the same and the driving is very arcadey.
70246957,english,1,360430,I really enjoy the game. Have played thru it numerous times. Just started back thru it again. I am probably one of the oldest PC gamers still gaming at seventy two years young. If anyone is older I would like to hear about your gaming experience.

191119581,english,0,360430,"If there were a ""[b]Neutral[/b]"" option on Steam, I would put this game in that category. Unfortunately, I have to choose between ""[b]Recommended[/b]"" and ""[b]Not Recommended[/b],"" and that's tough because my experience with this game was a mix bag of enjoyment but it also boring me to death.  Mafia 3 is a huge departure from Mafia 1 and 2. Those games had that signature ""Mafia feel"", you were deeply embedded in the mob, experiencing a gripping and linear, story-driven experience that captured the old-school gangster vibe. Mafia 3? Not so much. While you have ties to the mob, you’re not part of it in the same way. Instead, the game shifts gears and leans heavily toward an open-world, GTA-style/Ubisoft formula. This game isn’t inherently bad, but it does cause the game to lose part of what made the Mafia series so unique. The story is really good imo! It’s dark, gritty, and unforgettable! One of the strongest aspects of this game.  Unfortunately, the gameplay is a hufe let down. The missions are painfully repetitive. Taking over districts quickly becomes a chore. You’ll find yourself doing the same types of objectives over and over, and it drags the experience down. Combine that with frequent crashes! I had to restart the game multiple times just to get it running and it can be frustrating.  In the end, [b]Mafia 3 is a good game, but it’s not a good Mafia game[/b]. If you go in expecting something like Mafia 1 or 2, you might be disappointed. But if you give it a chance as its own thing, there’s some enjoyment to be found. Just be prepared for the rough edges."
122590783,english,0,360430,2k Launcher. Hate leaving reviews that don't talk about game but I can no longer play it thanks to launcher. This is my fruitless attempt to give myself some form of relief by punishing them in my small insignificant way.
29925489,english,0,360430,"From pre-release trailers this game looked to be like a more expansive version of the amazing Mafia II, but no.   Pros: +The story, like Mafia II's is very well written. +The facial animations in cutscenes are the only thing the game truly exceeds at.  Cons: -Gameplays is needlessly dull and repetitive. You know UbiSoft towers? That optional ""content"" that was basically padded on to every Ubi open world game from 2012-15? That's this entire game essentially, yet somehow worse. -Speaking of repetitive, you literally go back to the exact same areas and do the exact same things in very short periods of time. -Something about the gunplay feels off and so does the driving. -Even on hard, the enemy AI is useless.  -The lack of content that wasn't there at launch despite being shown in trailers like changeable clothes just highlights how much of an unfinished mess this was. -Despite updates to add new features and slightly improve performance, this game still full of glitches and crashes on a more than capable machine.  -In general, the game looks awful. Its far more bland than the colourful screenshots used in advertisements and the games lighting in infamously abysmal. -Despite the well written story, there is so much padding between key story missions that I'd forget what was happening.    So yeah, this isn't good. Don't buy it. Not even if it's cheap. It's a sub-par bore-fest."
109933836,english,0,360430,"Yet another game where a Mixed review, instead of Recommended/Not Recommended, would be more appropriate.  Where the game shines is its story, cutscenes and voice acting. The first ~2 hours are amazing, with the cutscenes and gameplay elements interwoven to create this incredibly engaging storytelling experience… and then it drops you into the open world, which I will write about a bit later.  The animations within the cutscenes are just incredible. The lip synching, face animations etc. are the best I have seen so far. The textures are incredibly high quality as well. This makes me wish they just focused on the story in a linear fashion like in the previous Mafia games, instead of doing what they ultimately did. Outside of cutscenes the game looks good, though there are some weird looking instances of draw distance behaving erratically, same for glass and mirror reflections.  Story wise it’s engaging, interesting, presented in a pseudo-documentary with interviews with an aged cast of the game. The interview parts are thrown in periodically throughout the duration of the plot, without ever overstaying their welcome, but being frequent enough as not to let the player forget about them.  Main plot missions are fairly original, definitely more appealing than the open world, with some fantastic set pieces. I won’t spoil anything but, again, this proves they should have spent their time on making the game linear.  All of the above constitutes around 20% of the whole game. The remaining 80% is doing open world tasks: 1.	Go to district 2.	Talk with quest giver about taking over an enemy racket 3.	Do $X of damage to the enemy property by stealing money, killing enforcers, or burning assets within the district 4.	Once the $X of damage has been reached, return to the quest giver 5.	Get the mission to kill or recruit the racket owner in a building you most likely have already visited doing the $X of damage part of the mission 6.	Kill or recruit the racket owner Do all of the above 17 more times. Yes, you read that right. Seventeen. 9 districts, 2 rackets for each. No matter how good the combat is, how satisfying, vicious and brutal the takedowns are, how many different approaches you have to some of the tasks, you are essentially doing the same stuff again and again. This literally kills Mafia 3. This is the main reason this game has Mixed reviews here on Steam. I never had any technical issues, but that does not matter, since I have to kill the 25th damn enforcer and burn the 132nd box of assets on my way to kill the 13th racket owner.  Another issue I have is how over the top it is compared to other Mafia games. The protagonist, Lincoln, is a great example of it. Instead of being a regular human being like Tommy or Vito, Lincoln is a Vietnam war veteran seeking vengeance for the deaths of his family, who stands at 6 foot 3 inches and looks like he’s 250 pounds of pure muscle. He is able to run head first into a gun fight, eviscerating enemies with his combat knife left and right. If he gets hurt, he can just jam an adrenaline syringe into his arm and continue his rampage largely unimpeded, unless he encounters guys with shotguns. Lincoln is not a Mafia character, he is literally the Punisher. Why is the Punisher the protagonist of a Mafia game?  The DLCs are on the level of the main plot missions, so they’re good, but each of them is only around 2 hours long. They also are over the top, more like GTA than Mafia.  Ultimately, I cannot recommend it, because if you want to enjoy the story elements, you will require a TON of patience. I know I spent much time on it, but I wanted to know if there is any gameplay variation at any point in the game. There is not."
35854721,english,0,360430,"Not worth the $75.  $20-30 would be more reasonable, although it feels as though the developers were forced to release the game before it was complete.  Being a hardcore fan of the series, especially the second game, I was really expecting something special for the third (and possibly final?) game in the series.   Something about this game reeks of clashes between designers/developers. I feel almost as though there was a group of talented designers and developers with experience working on this game, trying to add quality where they could, but ultimately held back by the poor choices of other designers and developers.  Mafia III runs on an updated version of the engine that powered Mafia II. This feels evident in a subtle way; the dynamics and movement reflect that of the second game in the series.  You play the role of Lincoln Clay, an absolute monster of an ex-soldier who is out for blood at the neck of the most powerful crime boss in the city of New Orleans. Along the way, you build up your own team of lieutenants, complete missions and take over the city region-by-region.  THE GAMEPLAY is good in general, but it is executed and applied poorly. Prior games applied the beautifully crafted experience where you would meet up with fellow gang members and discuss details, work out what your goal was, and then work your way through a set of unique obstacles to each mission such as sneaking into warehouses or following cars to remote locations, sometimes with sabotage from the other team.  In Mafia III, each mission consists of a 'cutscene' in which Lincoln stands in front of some generic random person in the exact same way, and both talk about what you're going to do. Almost every single mission (around 98%) are identical in gameplay, and simply take place at different locations. They usually consist of ""Drive to this gang area, interrogate and/or kill the boss, and trash the place while you're at it. This is the games weakest point, and it becomes repetitive within half an hour of beginning missions as you predict what comes next. The cutscenes are re-used over and over for every single mission, with Lincoln simply standing over an enemy and holding a knife to his throat, then either knocking him out or killing him.  THE ENVIRONMENT of New Orleans is masterfully crafted. I was personally excited to experience the ""French Ward"", based on the French Quarter of New Orleans in reality. Each area is detailed with gorgeous buildings, vivid lights and a whole group of beautifully subtle features that make the world feel 'real'. Walking past houses, you might walk right up to a random front door and hear muffled music inside.  There is one flaw however, there is absolutely nothing to do in New Orleans! You cannot eat at bars, find new clothes, steal from weapons shops, do any kind of interesting activity (bowling, use strip clubs etc).  THE CARS seem to handle pretty much how you'd imagine cars from the 1960s would. Big, boxy designs of the late 60s barrel around corners with horrendous understeering which in itself, actually becomes a fun mechanic; you must navigate your environment carefully.  However, you cannot own your own vehicles in this game like the previous ones. There is no car that is special to you, you must simply steal one, or request a lieutenants man to bring you one of a tiny handful of custom selected cars .  THE WEAPONS have absolutely no guts. Instead of massive revolvers that punch holes in enemies and machine guns that rip things to shreds, each weapon feels like a cap gun shooting bb pellets. The sound design is clear but poorly suited to each weapon, and the gunplay segments are repetitive. Enemies shoot back blindly with no co-ordination or tactics. One thing that did irk me is the inclusion of weapons from the 1980s when the game is allegedly set in 1968.  Something Mafia II did well was allow you a sense of progression in the world. Vito had to work his way up (often for the rug to be yanked back out from under him) and it was apparent through different houses, cars, amounts of money etc. In Mafia III, you actually own no more or less at the end of the game than you do at the start with the exception of territory. There is no acquired sets of clothes, no arsenal of weapons, no garage of cars.  For MAFIA II fans; The game does give a definite, but extremely quick closure to Mafia II, but I would recommend simply searching youtube for 'Mafia III Joe Barbaro' to find out what happened. Vito has changed a fair bit since his time in Empire bay. His way of speaking and his accent are different, now resembling the fast-talking chicago-type gangster rather than the logical Vito once represented in the previous game. He's become extremely aggressive, fast-talking, and seemingly bitter with everything.  + Very authentic New Orleans Environment  + Atmosphere is incredible, can be very beautiful sometimes.  + Incredible Soundtrack  + Interesting lieutenant mechanics, being able to call in favours from others and try to keep everyone happy with owning a piece of the city each is a challenge.  + Driving can actually be quite fun, steering and maneuvering is quite satisfying.  - Story is stretched out and predictable  - Extremely repetitive gameplay  - Poor weaponplay  - Buggy, low framerate from time to time, repeated crashes.  - Inaccurate for the period (ie weapons from the 1980s in a game set in 1968, cars from the 70s in 1968 etc)"

26073749,english,0,360430,"There's not a single good thing that I can say about this game.  The story is supposed to be good but it just isn't! An orphan came back from the war and fights racist criminals who killed his homies. That's it. That their story. I don't know about you, but I didn't expect this lackluster from a Mafia title. And the developers have told the story and shown most of the cutscenes on their YouTube channel anyway. Gameplay is unbelievably repetitive, everything feels the same, like running in circles. Or rather walking very slowly. There's usually just a single animation for each action and it gets very annoying watching it over and over and over and over ... again. Driving cars is not enjoyable in this game and you'll be driving a lot. I was quite disappointed that there's no cockpit view. I mean we've seen it in promo videos how Clay switches the gears and tunes his radio but there's none of that in the game. Also customization options for cars are more limited compared to Mafia II and became available long after the launch. NPCs react unrealistically to hero's actions. I broke into a closed empty club at night and there was just one girl dancing non-stop paying no attention what-so-ever to me until I shot her. Bystanders run straight towards the player to call the police and enemies can't see Clay right in front of them in stealth. Graphics are insultingly bad. Textures are a blurry mess, sky is the worst I've seen in any game. It can turn bright orange in the middle of the night and it changes in such a weird way that you question the state of mind of programmers responsible for that all the time. How did they manage that game looks worse than games from ten years ago is beyond me. Soundtrack which I've already heard in a hundred other Vietnam themed games and movies is great. But it was created half a century ago by people who have nothing to do with Hangar 13. And last but not least. The centerfold girls are the same ones that were in the previous game... It's not that costly to do a new photoshoot of girls in 60s interiors. Overall game feels like a lazy cash grab. I'm very disappointed."

59026047,english,1,360430,"A CRIMINALLY underrated game. I've been playing this game with all the DLC and I gotta say it's has been an amazing experience. I know Mafia 3 is a pretty divisive games amongst fans and regular players, but for me personally? I love it and it's right up my alley.  CONS: 1. Repetitive gameplay loop - Now, I'll clarify this: the gameplay loop never bothered me too much. I loved the combat and driving mechanics, so it never grinded my gears like with other players. I do understand that this can be a breaking point for some folks. 2. BUGS - Now, I played Mafia 3 when all the patches were implemented. Still, I got 2 crashes when finishing a mission and there were some bugs that popped up that really annoyed me. Example: I finished a simple objective in a mission and when a cutscene script was supposed to kick in, I was just standing in place and couldn't move at all. Thankfully, I was able to fix it with ease by loading a checkpoint. Still, stuff like that can be very annoying and can put people out of the experience easily.  PROS: 1. Great story & Excellent Characters - If there is one thing most people can agree on about Mafia 3, it is that the story, writing, and characters are very well done. I actually gave a crap about all the characters and wanted to see where the story was gonna go next. One thing that Mafia 3 does better than most of it's competitors is that it actually has compelling villains with understandable motives - hell, some even have RELATABLE motives. Along with that, the game accomplishes to not absolve them and make them sympathetic. They're still terrible people, but it doesn't mean they're aren't human. Mafia 3's story and characters are definite highlight. 2. Combat - The combat in Mafia 3 is super satisfying. Going in guns blazing or sneaking in like a predator are both options that can be done with no qualms or setbacks. Gun sounds have a satisfying kick and the feedback from enemies in terms of death and injury are very brutal and strong. Headshots have a crispy pop and the general combat mechanics ride a nice line between over-the-top violence and realism. 3. Driving - Now I ain't no NASCAR driver or car expert, but the driving in Mafia 3 is fucking awesome. You really feel the weight of the vehicle you're driving. The sequences where you're chasing someone, or are being chased are butt clenching-ly tense and exciting. The police chases in this game are actually intense! Oh, and the racing is a very neat 4. Mocap and animations - The mocap in Mafia 3 is some of the best I've seen in a while. A definite highlight is Father James, who has one of the most expressive faces in gaming history. When there was actual emotion coming from a character's face, I felt it - down to the individual wrinkles and all. 5. Presentation - Mafia 3's best strength BY FAR is it's interpretation of the 60s during the ending of Vietnam Era and Civil Rights movement. You can feel Vietnam and the racial tensions all over the game. There are moments in the game where key events in that time period are mentioned and even play a small part in the story and gameplay. Hell, the way they tied how the police works with the time period is excellent. If you cause havoc in one of the poorer and predominantly Black districts, police are less likely to respond to your actions. However, if you start shit in the more wealthy districts like Downtown and the French Ward, the police are gonna be on your ass just like that. 6. Soundtrack - The original soundtrack for Mafia 3 has become one of my faves in recent memory, but the real star of the game is the licensed soundtrack. This game makes amazing use of songs like ""Paint it Black"" and ""Just a Little Bit"". It elevates certain scenes and makes them feel ecstatic. 7. DLC - I'm not gonna spoil any of the DLC, but all I'll say is this: BUY THE DELUXE EDITION. The DLC expansions are all great and adds some very much needed variation to the game. It turns the game into a worthy purchase, in my humble opinion.  All in all, I love Mafia 3 and think it's a great sequel to Mafia 2 (Which I also loved). The story, characters, writing, presentation - along with the pretty good combat - sealed the deal for me, personally. However, I do know that it went away with some loved mechanics from previous games and the gameplay loop can be deal-breaker for some players. So what I'll say is that you should definitely wait for this game to be on sale or when it permanently becomes cheap. Buy the deluxe edition to get the full experience with the DLC. Thank you for reading my review."
161384394,english,1,360430,"I couldn't care less about what many people say about this game having repetitive levels or bugs. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this game.  The story depicted a compelling tale of revenge.  The characters were excellently chosen, and the game featured some awesome cars, interesting cutscenes, and a fantastic open world.  The DLCs were good overall, except for one that was bad.  This game had some weaknesses but it was worth my time.  Mafia 1 and 2 might be better, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of this one. 8/10"

132170021,english,0,360430,"It feels harsh to post a negative review after 244 (alleged) hours playing and enjoying it at times. Underneath the janky graphical style is a SOLID ""conquer  the territory"" game that has great missions, good visuals, a well-developed city, a big map, constantly lots to do. Or there would be if the game would just get out of its own way.  Probably the hands-down W.O.R.S.T. port of a console game to PC that I have ever played. Transitions, such as cut-scenes, seem to crash the game pretty regularly, even after all the years of patches.  The map seems open world, but really, it's not. The freedom to face enemies your own way is seriously limited by a top-down 2D design for the tactical map (what you move around in) that says, ""No, you may not climb those rocks to get cover"", ""No, you may not go through some bushes, that's a boundary"", ""No, you may not smash that window and get cover inside that building, use a door like normal people!"" and so on.  It's pretty clear this game was developed to a seriously limited budget. Which is a shame, because the developers had some serious chops, some solid ideas are in it, they've had to cut corners, but they've tried to bring their vision to bear. But, in the end, those limitations lead us to a game that feels very much like Mafia 1 design/graphics/limitations, a game from 2002, in a 2017 game.  So, it's a sad emoji ""No"" vote from me. I think if you can bear with the crap, play it -- I still try to -- but just go in eyes-open: knowing what you're getting yourself into."
28806210,english,0,360430,"PROS: - First 3 hours of gameplay are really great and enjoyable. - America's 60s - New Orleans...ehm..Bordeaux - America's 60s - Soundtrack! - America's 60s - Cars!  CONS: - Pretty much everything else. (Story. Missions. AI. Repetitiveness of game mechanics. You name it.)  Let me be perfectly clear. It's NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game. Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were. You simply can't remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it. Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get. There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities.  Result: Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team  do it properly. Unfortunately, Hangar 13 doesn't seem to have a clue about what original Mafia games really were about. If you really like America's 60s its worth a shot, though."
83163229,english,1,360430,"An amazing story that unfortunately gets dragged down by its tedious, repetitive game design. I truly enjoyed Lincoln as a protagonist, he's a layered character with nice voice acting. The game definitely is not shy to deal with mature subject matter, deals with alot of subjects that might make a few people uncomfortable. The base gameplay is enjoyable but feels off from time to time. definitely not the most refined shooting in an open world game that I've played. Brutal combat takedowns are absolutely enjoyable to pull off. Stealth is bare bones but it works. I do recommend its story, and its solid dlc."

However, if you have the time, the extra coin, and love mob stories, this tale has a satisfying end."
140943024,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 got a bit of a bad rap when it was released, and (at the time of writing) still has 'Mixed' reviews.   This is a little unfair, while the criticisms levelled at the game at launch (buggy, samey combat, poor performance) may be true to some degree, the Definitive edition, with all the extra DLC it brings, means that the game is rarely boring.  Mechanically, the game is much like any other GTA-clone - more open world than Mafia 2 (and much more than the original), but still without an excess of side missions (indeed most combat encounters are either story missions, or in order to unlock the next story mission).  The game has a clearly defined story, but each region of the city must be 'worked' to force the capo of the region to come into the open.  That is typically achieved by finding and disrupting the street level crimes in the racket (the gun runners, the drug dealers etc.) and interrogating low level enforcers until you have forced the head of the racket into the open.  Dispose of both rackets in a region, and the capo is exposed for a mission. The missions themselves are often great, some intelligent set-pieces, and pretty good gun-play.  The grind work however is a little more boring (hence the initial complaints).  All the mechanics are fine, it's just annoying going around the city's whorehouses to gun down pimps, only to be sent back to one of those same whorehouses to dispose of the racket boss.  Fortunately, those locations are great, and no two regions share the same rackets (though there are similarities of course), and the formal game missions are top notch.   The game actually starts with a stand-out mission - a bank robbery gone wrong, which climaxes in a boat race under the city to the thundering theme of 'Born to be wild'.   However, the games first mis-step for me, was at the end of this escape, as we ploughed the boat up and over a ramp the camera pulled away and I roared 'Born to be Wi-i-i-ild'... The game did not however force the climax of the music here (whether by accident or by design).  It's a silly thing, and yet rather than an epic (if cliché) end to the chase, instead the main flow of the song continued and i felt deflated.   The game never again manages to blend the music and stylings so well, and since i heard the song multiple times in the future, maybe it was purely coincidence, but what an opportunity was missed.  The soundtrack overall is great, there's some obvious classics missing, but the period accurate music selection is wide enough, and good enough, that it is highly reminiscent of GTA Vice City before they started dicking around to avoid renewing the licensing - I fear that when Mafia 3 inevitably gets the same treatment, it will steal much of the games charm (but fortunately that is not true yet).  The remaining sound design, particularly voice acting, is excellent, and really sets the tone for the 70's in the deep south of America.  Racism is on display nearly everywhere through the game (though oddly not too much from pedestrians), and is obviously a central tenet of the story and dialogue, but it's played well, enough to make you uncomfortable, and remain sympathetic to the protagonist.  Mafia 3 stands out from others in the genre, by making you give the regions you liberate to allies, who in turn grant bonuses to you - a gunshop, extra health, someone to collect money from you (when you die, you respawn at a safe house but lose half the cash you have in your pocket - so this is a huge perk) etc.   There's also 2 distinct car upgrade routes.   Firstly, for completing side missions for your allies, and secondly at the garage.    The game explains this terribly, but the garage upgrades are purely cosmetic and utterly pointless, while the ones from your allies are worthwhile.  There is a racing series (which i suspect is from a DLC) which this becomes critical for, but these upgrades can also be useful for just generally getting around the city.  The city itself is a wonderful place, a huge bayou area, and then 7 or 8 distinct city areas, each with clear architectural styles, and unique feels.   It's definitely one of the best cities I've seen in an open world game like this, and while it's not so fun to just drive around once you've done the story, it's definitely part of the character of the game itself (and surprisingly memorable to navigate too).  Overall, I do recommend Mafia 3.  While the first game holds a special place in my heart (how many other games have the cops pull you over for doing 35 in a 30...), and I felt more comfortable in the world of the second game, it's a testament to the world building of 3 that while it's not a comfortable world to inhabit, particularly as Lincoln Clay, but that I wanted to see what would happen, both to the city, and to Lincoln. For the other launch criticisms of poor performance and crashes, I had no such issues, the game was routinely locked at my screen refresh of 120fps except for brief moments maybe 2 or 3 times a playsession when the game was buffering in another part of the city.  Perhaps with less RAM, or a slower GPU it might struggle, but I suspect it's been heavily optimised since launch."
76147294,english,0,360430,"[b]Mediocre at best.[/b]   This game was never finished to the fullest. And after re-release of ""Definitive Edition"" experience  got even worse across all platforms. I will get back  to that later.   Game looks amazing and stunning at times. Has great Soundtracks of the late 60s. All tho still not as big as GTA or Saints Row earlier releases. But thats ok.   Combat is pretty good along with the new finishing moves and rechargeable slow-mo ability that you can use on a go. Also you get a bigger choice in arsenal, and not just small arms but big heafty weapons too. Always a big plus in my book, just remember to farm some cash because  they arn't cheap. I guess inflation impacted all. I almost forgot, you can carry only 2 weapons at a time.   Plenty of nice cars to drive and race if you get to that point. However you can't save any random vehicle in ur garage [i]Psst you don't really have one anyway..[/i]    You can only call for the ones you own or unlocked, you select the car from the list and get it delivered to your location just as weapons van or money pick up. Yes there are no weapon shops anymore.   [i]Q: Can I upgrade my cars?..[/i] A: Yes but mostly for the looks, only gear transition makes any changes in performance. Rest has to be either earned or purchased (locked to progress of the story) [i]Q: really?[/i] A: Si.   [b]Districts[/b]  Ahh yes the new implementation to the game that didn't do  anything new. Idea that was pretty good in Saints Row 2 and fun to play in co-op and really bad in The Godfather 2. Here you take away 9 districts (6 if you look for choice) away from Bad Sal Marcanos hands and you call the shots on who gets what district to rule and what benefits you  receive from it all or how much of a cut you get from it... But not to fast you will have to do additional tedious fetch quests if you want to max your earn from EACH! district. OK?! Alrigh.   [b]Story[/b] It exists... Its the rest of the gameplay that dosn't hold the torch to  that story with isn't bad, but has no grip like the old ones.  The best moments are literally when you are after consiglieres. The rest is rinse and repeat Go there and find out what he knows. ok now go there and interrogate this or that guy.. ok ok noww gooo and kill all soldiers till Capo shows up! And you go on like that x 15-16 times. Oh FUN! Worth it!   [b]Now onto the things that made me sad and than mad.[/b]   [b]BUGS[/b] Bugs that prevent you from progressing story, solution? [i]Yes load last checkpoint, no biggy but annoying.[/i]   Random crashes and + achievement stat reset. (You can't view your ingame stats like in previous M2 that would be to much to ask for, so make notes) Game gets to call the shots on that one I'm afraid, and when it dose it resets your stats like: total money earned/spent, how many underbosses you flipped or killed, how many enemies you've killed with specific weapon, melee kills and distance travelled with super car... Awesome! Apparently they use to be fine before the ""Definitive joke"" release, but after it was a different story. I can confirm I have to work around them because  attempting speedrun is somewhat impossible with random  crashes. Be warned! game is unstable.    AI is more of an A than I when it comes to driving.  Doing 120mph on a road (Police dont mind) approaching crossing section, one tw4t! decides to slow down while  you are close by so you have minimal chance to avoid him... EVERY SINGLE TIME! Its like they see you coming and  become brain dead. Because F you man and your nice car.   Ohh and dont even get me started on the laughable ""damage model"" of the cars. none existent. Sounds ok to me.. some say. Yeah well until your hood opens up and you can't close it down like in the previous Mafia 2  [i]I've used the hood view while racing on the busy streets.[/i]        RED ALERT! RED ALERT!! SPOILERS AHEAD!  Hear me out. Ending of the Mafia 1 [spoiler]Story deepens, get immersive  Toma's Angelos wisdom words after being shot like a dog on his front yard. Heart breaking[/spoiler]   Ending of Mafia 2 [spoiler]Simple but still gripping, attaches you to characters Last words after completing final mission. [i]""Sorry kid.. ******* wasn't part of our deal""[/i] Jaw dropping and heart stopping moment.[/spoiler]   Ending of Mafia 3 [spoiler]Little connection to your underbosses Cutscenes says more about your actions, good last confrontation with Sal Marcon (3 ending)  [u]Only one of 'em is cool.[/u] Donovan steal the whole show! xD Aahahahahahah[/spoiler]   [spoiler]Seriously i want to know what the hell is Donovan going to do after his last action. Where is he going to run.... I want to know.[/spoiler]   DLC are alright I guess Well maybe except that last part with renovating  Sammy's place, what a joke.    [b]Summery[/b]   It feels like a new engine demo, with alot of ideas  thrown in together to see what sticks and what dosn't.  I'm all for innovations and risky ideas to change or  improve the experience, that is how we get good games  in the first place. But when the game tries to be different and fails at doing so, Nvm the fact that it has unfixed bugs or that it lacks in attention to detail in some departaments. But when the main attribute of the series (story) fails to make an impact... man something went wrong.   Its hard for me to recommend this guys, especially after  Definitive joke Edition release. And I'm a big fan. I will be honest.. NO! its just boring, no soule   However. 1968 can be best experienced here if your willing to close your eyes on few things here and there. apart from that treat it like a modern mainstream game.  Review note update 25/09/20  Tagging spoilers and sort out my bad grammar along with nonsense I've putted here and there. ^^   Thx for reading."

97967167,english,0,360430,"I have a pretty high tolerance for bad gameplay when the story is good, so I really believed I could finish this game in spite of its flaws. I was wrong. I heard the game is a buggy, repetitive mess with bad mechanics - but the Mafia 1 remake used the same engine and was actually really good, so I figured... how bad can it be? If the story is good (and that's the one thing the reviews seem to agree on), I'll get through it. I was wrong.  What broke me was not the unbelievably high number of bugs and glitches for a AAA game that's been out for 5 years, nor the fact that the graphics are embarassingly bad with the stupidly short draw distances and exaggerated pop-in, terrible lighting effects and just flat out boring visuals (GTA V was released 3 years earlier and looks a hundred times better). It wasn't the wonky gameplay, subpar driving mechanics ( + no fast travel), repetitive missions, god-awful AI, annoying intrusive and unnecessary HUD,  bad UI, or pointless chores like stashing your money after every big mission so you don't lose it when you die. I can live with all of that. It's extremely annoying, but I can handle it.  What broke me is something I didn't actually see other reviews mention at all - The terrible way the story is intergrated into the game: In Mafia 3, you don't get to go do story missions whenever you want to, potentially ignoring all of the repetitive side activities, like you would in other open world games. No. You go around doing repetitive side activities, and after you've done enough, you get rewarded with a little bit of story. The story, while good and carried well by really good voice acting, is basically bait. It's dangled in front of you like a prize to get you to do more crappy boring shit, and just when the tensions are high and you feel it getting interesting... hold it! Gotta grind for another 2 hours, then you'll get to see what happens next.  That's just inexcusable. I stopped when I finally got my gang together, and then unlocked 5 new neighborhoods to go do repetitive shit in before I can get a few more crumbs of story. The game even had the audacity at this point to tell me ""Hey, since this is the Definitive Edition, here's some DLC side content you can do as well!"" I just said to myself - ""Nope, I'm not doing this shit"", closed the game and uninstalled it.  This game is an absolute disaster. Don't buy it, and don't even play it if you got it for free. It's not worth you time."

The story was very different to me because Mafia 2 is one of my favourite games of all time and Mafia 3 certainly does not live up to it but it still has a lot to offer to a new-comer or an oldie.  7.5/10"
105752312,english,1,360430,"i didn't understand the hate for this game, but i recently realized the reason why.  mafia 1 and 2 are relatively short (between 10-15 hours), linear stories with little to no pause between chapters, and no great reason to venture beyond the given path. (now for the record, i also adore both 1 and 2 for what they are.)  but mafia 3 deviates away from that. it plops you into a big open world city where you are free to do what you please, when you please. there is little to no direction given for what you ""must"" do or go. added, the story is also about 4x the length of its predecessors.  [b]i sincerely think[/b] the reason this game gets the flak that it does is because those who enjoyed mafia 1 and 2 are people who primarily enjoy the more linear gaming experience. and there is nothing wrong with that! but because of it, mafia 3 can be very overwhelming if you don't know what you're getting into or have your expectations fixed on something closer to the other games.  because there is a LOT to do in mafia 3. and quite honestly, this was the experience i was hoping for all along from a mafia game. i LOVE fighting for rackets, assigning districts, and all of the characters are just excellent. i feel in control and invested, this city is gorgeously designed, and i love a good revenge story. people say the story is ""simple"" but, that sounds so dismissive of what a good story it really is. seriously, does it NEED to be complicated? it's not exactly like the previous two games were particularly complex, but their stories were also great!  as for ""grindy"" and ""repetitive"" gameplay: i only half-agree. primarily, seriously, ya'll gotta get fucking creative! if you're just going in guns blazing with the same loadout for every interaction, yeah, it's gonna get stale. but the game gives you ample options to mix it up. [i]so mix it up![/i]  [b]BUT[/b], as i mentioned above, if you're the type of gamer who only enjoys a more linear experience, i can see this becoming tedious.  but for me? i fucking love it. i haven't been so hyped for a game from story to characters in like over a year.  so to recap/t;ldr: [b]Mafia 3 is NOT a linear gaming experience. It is open world, free choice, and very long (when compared to the other mafia titles). Story and characters are excellent, but if its gaming style not what you are looking for, stick with Mafia 1 and 2.[/b]"
25936825,english,0,360430,"Well, I have been reading through most reviews, positives and negatives and none of them seems to match my fellings about this game, so I decided to write one myself. I'll List pros, cons and neutrals and give my conclusions at the end of the review. Maybe its just luck but I haven't experienced a single CTD and only very few fps drops (After the fps patch they seem to become more common, but still manageable) and one small freeze.  I'll update the review at each new patch or fix released.  Pros: + Catching story and interesting historical setting + Good voice acting and facial animations. + Great atmosphere and city. Makes you feel inside the game and the historical context + AMAZING soundtrack. 60's rock, blues, jazz and country all the way fitting perfectly with the overrall setting. + Interesting characters, rich dialogues and the plot seems consistent so far even if sometimes its feels rushed. + Impressive lightining effects even though there still some bugs and some people that dislike it. + Cinematic narrative. It feels like you are watching a documentary about your character life and impact on New Bordeaux crime scene.  Neutrals: . Driving Mechanic. I personally like it, as it seems like real driving but I guess a lot of people will not think like me. . Somewhat strange animations. (Getting into or out of cover, Lincoln running with a gun and pedestrians animations are particularly weird.) . A not-so-free world. Even though you can just hang around the city without any specific objective there isnt much to do outside the missions and collectables (It seems there will be patches to fix this, wich reinforces my final conclusion) . Racket System gets repetitive too soon. . Cluttered UI. I can go past it, but it's really annoying sometimes. . Textures are not high-ended and polished as one could expect from a 2016 AAA game but it doesn't mean they are ugly!  Cons: - Grainy and often foggy graphics. (The fps patch released on 10/08 adress this, it looks much better now but still an issue) - Step back from Mafia I and II. Shops, bars, clubs are useless even though they are marked on the map, policemen dont care if you are driving 120mph, cargoes dont get damaged etc. These small bits of realism that made the Mafia series unique are absent. - Very restricted field of view (remember GTA 3 and VC? That the map loading was so slow that you could go to someplace before it was even loaded?) (10/09 Update: Fps update adress this as well, it looks reasonable now) - Notable graphic quality drop from cutscenes to actual gameplay.  - FPS lock (30 fps in 2016? Seriously?!) (Even if now there is a patch for that it still a HUGE flaw for a pc game coming out with a 30fps lock) - Bizarre night and day cycle. There's no in-game clock (at least I haven't seem one) and day/night cycles looks totally random for me. - Bizarre control scheme (Why not use GTA scheme?) (I play on a controller btw, things seem shitier for keyboard users) - Very Dumb AI. Enemies and NPC's both. - Overral feeling that you are a playing a BETA and not a finished game. Especially because the next patches will bring things that should already be in the game (as outfit changing, street races, interactive shops etc)  Conclusions:  1) Mafia III is a consistent game with a lot of potencial. Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales. Actually I would give it a 6/10 but it has potencial to hit as high as 9/10 or higher.  2) This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me.  3) DONT PRE-PURCHASE!!! Pre-purchasing ANYTHING is just plain dumb. You are giving away your money in exchange for the promise of a product and NOT for the product itself. This is destructive to any kind of industry as the quality tends to drop as the profitability of that product is already guaranteed before the product even exists. And in my humble opinion this is exactly what happened with Mafia III. A game that was released rushedly and unfinished, with no concern to customer satisfaction as a healthy profit was already safe and sound way before the release date."
40153590,english,1,360430,"[u] M3[/u]  So; like most people, before buying this game I was kinda turned away from it from hearing about it's mixed reception.  I came in optimistic and I played it non-stop for an entire week.  So yeah, I really like this game. Speaking as a fan of the entire trilogy.  The first main game-tweak I noticed that made the game more fun to play compared to [b]M1 & M2[/b], was the open-world approach of; do anything, whenever you want. -- Both [b]M1 & M2[/b] have story missions that are often driving from one edge of the map to another for entire chapters. But the way this game handles 'city district takedowns' with 10+ objectives to go to in the zone, where you only need to clear 5-6 to progress in the story.  Also, the racket-takedown / infiltration parts are not nearly as shallow or repetitive as its reputation would have you believe. You get new weapons and tools, and there are numerous strategies to test and experiment with each time.  -- In addition to the many twists the game throws on that aspect during the mid-to-late game.  Looking at the statistics on, say, achievements, apparently between 1/5 or 1/4 people actually reached the ending of the game. Perhaps this is part in how those critizisms were overblown?  And on the big subject of the game's setting change from [b]M1 & M2[/b]: it's still a crime drama like the rest of the series.  With the characters I'll say, as a huge Mafia II fan and an MGS fan; Lincoln to Vito is the Raiden to Solid Snake. -- That's not a bad thing.  Also on the setting, the game-feel is different and more modernized, this also confused many fans. My best response to this is to take a qoute from [b]YouTuber ChuggaConroy[/b], when he played trough [b]Super Mario Sunshine[/b] and commented on how different it was to all other main-series games in that:   [h1]""I wouldn't say it's unpolished, it's just a different kind of polish""[/h1]   If you're an optimist, you'll most likely enjoy it.  -- Just remember to spend some time in the in-game settings before diving in, the 'kinda dark default lighting', the keyboard controls for movement, combat and driving.   I urge you not to be turned of by the reputation, there's a really good game under its rocky start."
28173471,english,0,360430,"As much as I wanted to like it, I simply cant. The starting story (the first 20 ish minutes of the game was the best parts, and for 15 of those minutes it's a cutescene and for the other 5 you're in a bank). The story dies off and is followed up by repetitive gameplay doing the same thing over and over again but with different looking enemies.  Step 1: Deal damage.  Step 2: Kill officers. Step 3: Kill distict bosses. Step 4: Make higher ups angry and then kill them (also they spawn in the same place, not even a new area).  Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 about 6 or more times and then call it a game.  Also it's great when the vehicles and ai glitch making it lag and having explosions everywhere. The ai of this game invented drifing 100% All in all not worth $60 in the slightest. More around $30 ish. Just play dishonered 1 or 2. They are much better."
101468353,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 marks the last game in the Mafia trilogy and with the general reception it received, it could end up being the last new Mafia game for a long time.  I last played Mafia 3 back when it released in 2016. I remember playing it, enjoying it and moving on. Since then I've played tons of other games and my opinions have changed. I know that today, Mafia 3 is pretty heavily criticised and has a pretty bad reputation overall.  After beating the game all over again, I can say I do recommend it, but just barely and with a huge warning attached. I won't lie to you, this should have been the best Mafia ever made, its lost potential is found in every damn part of it. After playing it I can conclude that I suspect this game was a victim of rushed/rocky development. For every amazing or high quality aspect, there are some mind boggling omissions. Of course, we will never truly know what happened whilst this game was being made. All we have is the final product.  The story tries a lot of things. While I love the idea behind it all, it feels unfortunately rushed and improperly thought out just like many other elements of the game. You follow Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam War veteran and coloured man living in the fictional New Bordeaux in Southern America in the late 60's. Without spoiling anything, the game is an overarching revenge plot as Lincoln leads a war against the Italian Mob after they take everything away from him. The actual revenge plot is pretty compelling overall. The introduction is quite lengthy and definitely helps you learn many of the characters, making it hit even harder when everything comes crashing down. The game does a great job of making you absolutely hate these enemy characters. The main issue revolves around the theme of racism and the main villain himself. To discuss the themes, racism is extremely prominent in this game. Due to the time period and location presented, I expected racism to be pretty prominent. However, I don't think I am alone when I say this game is incredibly self indulgent in it. You will hear the n word probably almost a hundred times before the game is over. Initially its uncomfortable, but after you hear it a hundred times you become numb to it. Its pretty obvious that the story has undertones of coloured revenge on white people, seeing as you are a coloured man taking down an entire empire consisting of almost entirely racist white people. This isn't an issue on its own, it is however very transparent in pointing towards an agenda when it didn't need to be. The people you face in this game are already horrible people, you don't need to remind that they're racist every five seconds to motivate me to take them out. As for the villain, he is just plain hollow. He is kinda just a piece of shit and nothing else. His personality is that he is a racist, greedy psychopath and that's about it.  On a technical level, this game is a huge mixed bag. Characters can look extremely detailed, but on the other hand some side characters look like they were pulled from a ps2 sports game crowd. The weather effects look downright bad and the sky-boxes look atrocious for a modern game. Some buildings look highly detailed whilst others are flat and bland. The vehicles look really good across the board, however the damage modelling is basic and unimpressive. Some animations are highly polished, whilst others like the molotov throw look hilarious in comparison. I could go on and on, but all you have to do is watch some gameplay for yourself. Its crazy hard to get immersed when the visuals are pulling you in so many different directions.  Thankfully, the game is pretty great in the sound department. Most of the voice actors do a pretty good job overall. General sounds are of a quality standard and the guns sound punchy. The music in this game is also incredible. Its an awesome selection of classics from the 60's era and made driving around far more interesting with the awesome tracks blasting behind me. My only complaint in the music department, is as you switch vehicles you will hear tracks repeating quite often and there is a very tiny selection of radio stations in game.  Being totally honest, Mafia 3 has one of the most oddly designed gameplay loops I have ever experienced. The gameplay on its own summarises why I feel this game was rushed. This also represents where the majority of complaints towards the game originated from. The idea is simple, there are 9 districts total, each containing two rackets you must take over. You follow a simple formula. You do a bunch of small objectives until you do so much damage to a racket, you eliminate the person running it and then you rinse and repeat. Once you have taken the two rackets in a district, you take out the main head of the district, dole it out to one of your under bosses and then you do it all over again for every single other district. The game feels good to play, but the mission variety is seriously lacking. The melee is kinda piss poor, but the shooting mechanics themselves are great. You spend the majority of the game just taking out district after district with very few proper story missions spread throughout. As everyone else has already said, it is a literal grind and a lengthy one at that. You take districts, dole them out, kill more lieutenants and do it over and over.  Here is the warning, if you do not enjoy Mafia 3's raw gameplay, then there is nothing for you here, run the hell away. If the shooting and raw mechanics weren't so satisfying for me, I would not have pushed through, hell no. The driving controls crazy good and the shooting is very satisfying, especially with the late game weapons. However, the objects are repetitive as hell and do not improve over the course of the game.  I know it sounds like i'm ripping the game to pieces, but overall I'm just mixed as hell. The raw mechanics are fun, but the objectives are basic and uninspired. The game is visually inconsistent, but the cutscenes look incredible. The setting is well depicted and the music is awesome. There is a lot to love, and a lot to despise about Mafia 3.  The game was fairly stable for the most part. The game does find it pretty hard to maintain a stable 60 frames regardless of settings, however the game never dropped below the 40's on high settings so it wasn't a huge issue. The only really bad bugs I experienced had to do with alt-tabbing. Everytime without fail, if I alt-tabbed the game it would erase the sfx audio, cause severe stuttering and the cutscenes would freeze. It is important to note that many of the bugs I experienced in Mafia Definitive Edition are present in this game also, which is pretty garbage.  The game took me around 17 hours to beat, so it is quite lengthy, but a lot of that is a district grind that not everyone is going to find tolerable. If you can get the game cheap, I would recommend giving it a try. Its not a bad game, but its got a ton of flaws riding against it. I recommend it just barely, but with a lot of warnings attached. Its a shame, because this could have been something far better."

Even story-wise it isnt the best, not a whole lot of connections to mafia II -except the obvious- but then again mafia II only had a tiny connection to the first one. Overall i guess if youre a big fan of the first two mafia games, and Mafia III is on a pretty nice offer, go for it. I think im a bit more than halfway through the game and i gotta say, the more i play the more disappointed i get.  Also, Shotguns are snipers and theyre OP as f**k and small shrubs are stronger than a f***ing truck. Enjoy"
121165154,english,1,360430,"I don't know why I got so hooked on this one. It is by all means a mediocre open world game - not even close to the excellency of RDR2. But something stange happend (I'd experienced it with DAYS GONE too): I kept on playing and having fun. I liked the writing, I liked the protagonist. It was refreshing playing an african-american hero and he managed to be both likeable, earnest and a total badass. I thought the world-building was well done too: The city looked like a real, geographical place, not a jumble of motifs and the team managed to design some beautiful set-pieces for the main missions: While abandoned theme parks and insane asylums don't sound very original in the context of a videogame, here, they were realized with such an attention to detail that I really enjoyed exploring.  Speaking of the missions: These are hit and miss. Most of the main missions that don't involve your criminal day-to-day activities are great, like [spoiler] your fight against a demonic new-age cult or the hunt for a lost sowiet warhead [/spoiler], but the rest is VERY repetitive, lacks variety and can occasionaly get tedious. It never pur me off playing though, maybe because the developers pulled of some great driving physics and gunplay. I truly enjoyed the shootouts and I liked how they allowed you to seamlessly combine stealth and violence. Overall the gameplay mechanics worked really well for me - save for the bugs of which there still are quite a few. Fortunately, none are game-breaking, most aren't even that annoying.  Story-wise, I'd say, I'm kinda 80% satisfied. Haden Blackman, the man who wrote Mafia III, also writes comic books which I felt was both a gift and a curse, since most of the characters were deftly written and felt solid enough for video game characters, but they did sometimes veer into Whedon-esque quips which I disliked. The dialogues with the CIA agent were particularly annoying. There were occasionaly points where I felt the writing was somewhat construed in order to move the plot along but it wasn't too bad. If RDR2 is the prime example of how to write interesting dialogues and make your characters archetypical instead of stereotypical, then Mafia III was a solid effort with some obvious shortcomings. At least they managed to nail late 60s in southern USA (at least as far as I can tell): Some of the radio commentary where bigots complain about the government's fair housing act because they fear their neighborhoods becoming open to black folks were hard to listen to because they sounded so realistic and were excellently voiced, just like the rest of the game by the way. There's not one weak performance.  So that's the stuff I liked. The criticisms brought up by others are all valid. Mafia III is repetitive, it lacks variety. It didn't feel dull to me, though, and I'd recommend you give it a try if you can get it on sale."
51071109,english,0,360430,"Let's start this review off by saying I played Mafia 2 many years ago and I absolutely loved it. Till this day it's one of my favourite games of all time.  When I heard that Mafia 3 was coming out, I was over the moon and I pre-ordered it which in the end was a big mistake. The game looked promising at first and it had a chance of being something great but it wasn't. Immediately after Mafia 3 was released, I played it non stop for 7 hours and after that I never touched it again. It was dull, repetitive, unpolished and I was utterly disappointed.  Today, after 3 years I decided to give it another chance. I really wanted to like this game but after a couple hours in I remembered exactly why I stopped playing. The missions are repetitive and you will be doing the same shit over and over again in each district. There, of course, are some good things too. The combat system is brutal, the music is awesome and the story seems okay so far but unfortunately I can't bring myself to play this game any longer when there are so many amazing games out there. It's unfortunate this game is not what I hoped it would be."
184974002,english,1,360430,"I got to buy myself a copy of this game with all the stigma of it not being a ""good"" mafia game. First of all, I must agree it is not really a Mafia game. Whilst playing you realise quite quickly that in reality is about putting end to the whole mafia mentality and getting revenge for those who were lost. Those new allies who were found in the process stood by your side. It was never meant for you to be a part of Mafia, but to build something a little better in the wicked world of ours. Story was great I really enjoyed it. Characters had good screen time ( mainly the allies ). Sadly without much development excluding, Clay, Donovan, Father James, Vito and Sal. Others were good too but for me did not have that much impact on the whole world/story of the game. DLCs were great I enjoyed them all. The first one with witch hunt was amazing story, that gave more time for Lincoln to develop, The second one with Roxy, was more fun but had a great background and I really enjoyed working with The Voice ( voice acted by a my guy Lee from TWD The Game Series :3 ). The third one with donovan was quick but action packed shit show, that was enjoyable too. Gameplay was most of the time very good. Some game mechanics polished over time, but there is still some bugs that can influence your opinion on the game. Its the nitt picky stuff, I enjoyed the game as is.  And to those the game was boring and too long of the same I strongly disagree. Mainly beating small racket bosses and then killing Sals lieutenants. Yeah it had its moments, but I still enjoyed killing every single KKK member, getting rid of the greedy fucks that were ruining the lives of many people. A literal ONE MAN ARMY!!  I can say I did all the SQ too, and it made the game whole. Just one thing is missing from this game. FAST TRAVEL MAN. The driving mainly for SQ was sometimes BORING :D.  8.5/10. Good job Hangar 13. Love from Slovakia."
89222166,english,0,360430,"[h1]The Premise[/h1] [h3]This review contains no spoilers.[/h3] [b]Mafia III Definitive Edition[/b] (M3DE) is a technically improved version of the original [i]Mafia III[/i], with all DLC content present in a single package. This story is about Lincoln Clay, a US Army veteran deployed during the Vietnam War as part of an elite unit. Back from the conflict, his involvement with the mafia families soon backfires: a deal gone wrong is all it takes to set Lincoln on a quest for revenge.  [h1]Quick Sum-Up[/h1] [table] [tr] [th]🟩 [b]The Pros[/b][/th] [th]🟥 [b]The Cons[/b][/th] [/tr] [tr] [td] 1. Authentic and vibrant recreation of a 1960s Lousiana city. 2.

[/td] [/tr] [/table]  [table] [tr] [th]🟨 [b]Bugs & Other Issues[/b][/th] [th]🔧 [b]PC Specs[/b][/th] [/tr] [tr] [td] - Occasional crashes. - Noticeable quantity of bugs ranging from moderate to severe. - Alt-tabbing can cause audio issues and other problems. - Mouse thumb buttons aren't recognized in key rebinding. [/td] [td] - Ryzen 3900X - RTX 2080Ti - 32GB RAM - NvME SSD - 1440p Display [/td] [/tr] [/table]  [h1]In-Depth Analysis[/h1] [h3]Pros[/h3] [b]1.[/b] New Bordeaux is by all means an exceptional recreation of a city of those times in Louisiana. From the cars, dresses and mannerisms of people - everything just blends together very well in a consistent manner. A lot of the buildings of this very large city are even explorable, which is something the previous Mafia chapters didn't have. The devs also made a bold move in depicting racism and discrimination with an uncensored form.  [b]2.[/b] Shootouts and fights are daily routine in a city plagued by gang wars and power struggles. Lincoln, on his bloody path, will face hundreds of enemies - so the combat better be damn good, and it indeed is. Weapon hits on foes have a good weight, for instance it's not rare to see enemies fly away after being hit by a shotgun, or contorting on the ground mortally wounded, before expiring. This realism does extend also to melee and takedown moves, which are quite a show too. Most weapon classes indeed play out and feel diverse, each with a specific style.  [b]3.[/b] The soundtrack encompassing and eventually emphasizing critical story events is well picked. Radio stations constantly broadcast a stream of iconic hits from the times, along with news and other chatter. Solid.  [h3]Cons[/h3] [b]1.[/b] By far, the biggest issue of Mafia III is the extreme tediousness of its tasks. Be it main missions, side activities or secondary quests, the majority of them falls into a very narrow set of archetypes that becomes stale very quickly. ""Go there, kill everyone, interrogate someone / steal something, go back to base."" Rinse and repeat for the whole game, i'm not even exaggerating one bit. There are some exceptions to this, but they're few and far in-between, way too far.  [b]2.[/b] Hundreds upon hundreds of collectible bits are scattered throughout the city, ranging from CDs to components and other stuff. They are often tedious to get, serve no purpose exception made for Components, and become a constant drag composed of ""get out of your car, get the shiny bit, go back into the car"", this for hundreds and hundreds of time on end. That's not all: main missions force players to first clear certain sets of side activities that always follow the same archetypes, thus further bloating the content.  [b]3.[/b] On paper, Mafia III has a lot of tools, upgrades and weapons to unlock at the Vendor and through raising the influence of Lincoln's associates. However, this progression never feels like it makes any major change: newly acquired weapons or upgrades (which involve significant grind) are never game changers as they feel marginally better at best, so the base combat / driving / exploring feel will not be changed much, nor the variety of approaches expanded by these upgrades.  [b]4.[/b] Enemy AI is dumb as bricks. Seriously. They will mindlessly expose themselves and try to snipe Lincoln with a pistol from miles away, while the protagonist uses a sniper rifle, for example. Enemies will often be oblivious or have very slow reaction times to Lincoln in stealth, which proves overpowered most of the time. This on the highest difficulty even.   [b]5.[/b] Graphics quality is very inconsistent even in this ""Definitive"" version. Some textures or models will be low quality, while others definitely up to par, seemingly without reasons. Draw distance will literally make cars or even buildings appear from thin air at random no matter the settings, while lighting effects have weird afterglows and ""trails"" in many situations, which is immersion breaking. In addition optimization is trash, with random FPS drops at times on a high-end machine.  [h1]Gameplay Breakdown[/h1]  [b]Exploration[/b] Is performed either on foot or by vehicle, there is no fast travel so everything has to be reached manually. New Bordeaux is a massive city littered with hundreds of collectibles, that have to be revealed by Wiretapping junction boxes (shown on the global map), provided Lincoln has enough Components to do so, which are scattered around. There is no worthwhile exploration to do apart from seeking and using Wiretaps to reveal everything in a map chunk, then repeat the process over and over.  [b]Combat[/b] Plays out in third-person shooter fashion, with the protagonist being able to carry two weapons at a time, belonging to different categories such as Shotguns, Pistols and so on. Most weapons either have to be found or unlocked at a trader for hefty sums, same goes for gadgets such as grenades or other contraptions. Stealth is a valid approach to most situations as well, being Lincoln a trained veteran, which can take down any enemy in melee combat - silently. Vehicle combat is also a thing, with the ability of shooting and throwing explosives from most cars, useful during chases.  [b]Management[/b] Consists in progressively conquering parts of the city, subtracting resources such as drug traffics from the mafia families and taking them under Lincoln's control. Several associates will progressively be unlocked for story reasons, each will manage the activities the protagonist assigns them, in turn unlocking specific rewards from a unique list each of them has. Many side missions needs to be completed to fully fortify an Underboss' position and unlock everything they have to offer as reward.  [b]Quests[/b] Are divided into Main, Secondary and Tasks. Usually the main ones progress the story, while others fortify the position of an Underboss or give Lincoln personal gains such as money or other rewards.

34240370,english,0,360430,"**Pros**  -Beautifully rendered city environment -Great soundtrack -Offers a variety of tactical choices in combat  **Cons**  -Shooting gallery AI -Dull and repetitive missions -Weak plot  Mafia III is like a selfish lover - it starts fast, climaxes early, and then rolls over and goes to sleep. After starting by throwing you into the action and quickly progressing to the game's dramatic turning point, it never gives you any compelling reasons to keep playing. Lincoln's quest for revenge after his betrayal is boring, implausible, and mind-numbingly repetitive.  The missions have little to no variety: kill, coerce, and destroy, in unchallenging and uncreative ways. There's no emotional urgency or tactical challenge to any of the laundry list of tasks that Lincoln is obligated to complete in order to advance the plot. They feel like delaying tactics to avoid progressing directly to the game's final showdown, instead of elements of a tightly woven narrative.  That's really a shame, because the game has a lot of promising elements that could have been made into an extremely compelling story. The atmosphere of social and racial tension that forms the backdrop of the game is portrayed in a pretty nuanced and thoughtful way (Dixie Mafia and voodoo dolls aside). People on the street freely share their opinions of the social and cultural upheavals of the late 60s, and their observations are generally authentic to the period. The talk radio programs also do a good job of exploring the polarization that existed during the period. And the sights and sounds of New Bordeaux are truly immersive. There are beachgoers, Mardi Gras revelers, heroin addicts, and a whole array of small touches that makes it feel as if you're truly moving through an inhabited city. Unfortunately, the story line fails to do its setting justice.  If Lincoln had been forced to conceal his identity and gather information on his own, slowly revealing the elements of the conspiracy that led to his betrayal, the game's narrative tension would've been much higher and the missions would've been more satisfying. Instead, the game introduces an old CIA buddy who's just completely out of place and irritatingly cartoonish. His sole purpose is to chain smoke and give out information that advances the plot through exposition instead of action. He may as well have been named MacGuffin. The only contribution his presence makes to the game is unearned information, deathly boring cutscenes of congressional testimony, bad acting, and goofy wiretap sidequests. It's an idea that should've been cut out the game entirely.  -GAME MECHANICS-  On normal settings, the AI will occasionally try to flush you out and flank you, but for the most part enemies will generously comply with staying in one spot and repeatedly sticking out their heads for you to blow off. Enemies will also offer themselves up like lambs to the slaughter when Lincoln ambushes from cover, repeatedly walking into the same trap despite the five foot high pile of bodies in front of it. Lincoln also has the ability to pick up and move bodies out of sight, in order to remain undetected. The cover mechanic is a bit wonky, making it difficult to move quickly from cover to cover, or to pick the intended cover in the first place, but given the AIs general incompetence, it's not that much of an issue. The ambush from cover mechanic is one of the more satisfying tools in the game, but as I mentioned earlier, it can be exploited because the AI will never avoid sending waves of enemies to the same ambush spot.  Despite the array of tools that Lincoln can be outfitted with, from molotov cocktails to proximity mines, combat overall is pitifully generic and unchallenging. The wide variety of heights, interiors, objects and landscapes that the game renders so meticulously are never fully exploited. Every encounter is a shooting gallery.  Shooting, driving, running and climbing all work pretty well. Bullet time is available, but the action was never intense enough that I even thought about using it. There's also a so-called ""intel view"" that gives you x-ray vision, and makes no logical sense.  -GRAPHICS-  New Bordeaux is beautifully rendered, with a wide variety of landscapes and neighborhoods on a sprawling game map. Many have complained about the game's poor optimization, but it runs well and looks stunning on my rig. YMMV.  -FINAL THOUGHTS-  Despite its lofty aspirations and beautifully-rendered setting, Mafia III's story and gameplay just never finds its footing, and it winds up lost in the bayou swamps. 5/10  System Specs: Win 10 64 bit | EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB GPU | Core i5 7600K @ 3.8 GHz CPU | ASRock Z270 Pro4 mobo | Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3200 16 GB RAM | PNY CS2030 480 GB NVMe SSD | WD Blue 7200 RPM 1TB HDD"
118606968,english,1,360430,"I know I might be a bit late, because the game came out around mid 2020, but I just had to make this review...  I don't even know where to start.  I'll start off by saying that this game is, for me, at least, the best Mafia game out of the three. With: a really big, open world, a lot of fun optional chapters, three FREE DLC stories that are really fun, and quite long, and an AMAZING story. This makes the game the best one out of the three.  Of course, as much as the game is amazing, it is not perfect. It does have bugs, some repetitive quests, but, that is quite small compared to everything else! I've spent a little over 74 hours on the game, and those were well spent hours. The bugs do not happen too often, but, they sometimes force you to load to your last checkpoint, which takes only about 10 seconds to do.  The story is... a masterpiece. Now... I know that some missions are repetitive, but the story as one of its kind, is amazing. A lot of heartbreaking, twisted, fun, hyper, sad, emotional, etc... moments, make the story a solid 10/10.  The optional chapters are also indeed very fun and interesting! They're not necessary, of course, hence why they're called ""optional"" chapters, but, they really build up a story for certain characters! Believe it or not, if you want to know the real story of some characters, you MUST finish the optional chapters. Optional chapters gave me even more amazing experience, and I would have hated myself if I did not finish them.  Story aside, let me talk about the graphics, physics, guns, cars, voice actors, soundtrack, etc...  The graphics are really good! It really gave a ""cherry on the top"" vibe, because it really is so beautiful. Not too great, not too bad. Right where the sweet spot is! A PC with average components will be able to run the game on max settings at 1080p with no problems!  The physics are also good! Sure, there are a few bugs here and there (e.g. if you turn on Aim Assist, at some points, it'll be more unhelpful, than helpful, but that's not always the case! Also, Aim Assist is recommended if you're playing with a controller, because the general sensitivity for a controller is kinda too fast for some certain guns.) Other than that, the physics are how they should be! Really well done, if you look over those small bugs.  There is a wide selection of guns. I personally loved using a simple pistol! I've felt most comfortable with it. My secondary weapon was an AK-47. Definitely helped me through all the ""Kill 'Em All"" moments, in which, a lot of enemies spawned. As I've stated, if you're using a controller, some guns may be a little harder to use than they should, but, Aim Assist should fix that (partly!)  I am not a guy that's into cars that much, but, this game made it so fun for me to just spend time driving around the map. My favourite type of cars was the Exotic section. Especially the fast, red one at the very bottom! They're very easy to control, and the modification for the cars is also great! (Note: To unlock all the modifications, and cars, you must complete optional quests, hint hint ;))  Each and every character had an amazing voice actor! The accent, the voice, the tone, it all suited amazingly for every single character! My personal character, and voice actor from the game, was Donovan! He is a complete savage, a really funny guy, and also very based!   Oh how I loved the soundtrack in the game. Excluding the radio, the music in cutscenes, certain chapters, etc... It was really amazing! Each and every soundtrack fit the chapter you were going through, so it really pumps up the hype when you're doing your thing!   Also another very big plus that I'd love to mention is the NPCs (enemies). They're indeed very realistic! (e.g. if you shoot somewhere, alert the enemies, move without being seen, the enemies will go past you to look at the location where you've fired shots from! This is a really great detail, and I don't think that a lot of games do this. Most games just send the enemies to where you currently are, even if you were not spotted. It also helps with taking down enemies faster!   Thank you for sticking with me in this review! I was really happy to write it, because, this game is indeed very special to me. Thank you 2K Games for making this masterpiece."
48337899,english,1,360430,"[h1] Is Mafia 3 a good continuation of the Mafia game series?	[/h1]  I started playing Mafia 3 right after my first playthroughs of Mafia and Mafia 2. I didn't have high expectations because I heard bad things about the game from some of my friends who played the game before. They were disappointed. They are big fans of Mafia games but they didn't like the last game at all. I spent 77 hours in the game finishing every single main and side mission and in my opinion it's a great game. It's just not a very good Mafia game as we know them from before.   Mafia 3 is different. I would compare it more to Watch Dogs or Watch Dogs 2. You no longer have a linear story. You have a huge open world and you have so much freedom in there - couple of main and side missions you can choose from and also you can start playing all 3 DLCs before you finish the game because they are part of the open world as well.  [h1] Story [/h1]  The main protagonist in Mafia 3 is a black man called Lincoln Clay. I can't say I felt much for him. He seems to be a very calm and emotionless person. He is a cool and tough guy, but that didn't make it easier for me to really care for him. He is like an empty shell.  Lincoln's story is a story of revenge. In my opinion the main plot is quite interesting and exciting. It might not seem like it at first, because there are many fillers in between the story parts. I always enjoyed those special final missions of each district which moved the story forward. Sometimes you get to know a bit about what's going to happen before it even happens because parts of the story are video tapes from the future where certain people talk about big and scandalous happenings in the city.  My most favourite character in the game was probably John Donovan, ex C.I.A. agent and close friend of Lincoln. Donovan became his trusted source supplying him with intelligence and advanced government technology. Donovan is a funny guy. Everytime there was a cutscene where Lincoln and Donovan met, Donovan made me laugh so much. He is cool, charismatic and self-confident.   Good news! There are some characters from Mafia 2 in the game so you can definitely look forward to seeing them again. They are the connection to Mafia series. Without them it would feel even less like a third Mafia game in the series.  [h1] DLCs [/h1]  The DLCs in Mafia 3 are simply amazing! I think that they should be part of the main game, but they are not, so please be sure to buy them as well if you decide to buy the game.  The main game can get a bit repetitive sometimes with all the open world activities so DLCs are a great way to add some variety. You should not wait until you finish the game to play them. You should play them before whenever you feel like you need something different. The stories are very special and the developers made some nice environments for it.  DLCs will unlock new equipments for you to use even in the main game afterwards and the ""Faster, baby!"" DLC will help you to earn some extra money which you might need for weapons or upgrades especially early in the game when your income is not that great.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  Your goal is to take over disctricts in the game. There are 9 of them and each district contains two rackets (criminal operations). Each racket will give you several objectives - kill, steal, destroy, interrogate, tail a vehicle. For example it could be an auto theft racket or a prostitution racket. But the gameplay is the same in all those rackets. When you take over both rackets in the disctrict you will unlock the main mission which will move the story forward and which has more special objectives and environments.  Once you take over a racket you can increase its earns to max by doing a very boring mission - delivering a truck with some supplies. I did not like those missions at all. The trucks are so slow and usually very far away.  Other boring missions were the loyalty missions for your underbosses. You want them to be loyal to you to get the best outcome for the game ending but their loyalty missions are so boring and repetitive and there are 6 of them for each of your underbosses. 6 of the same boring missions... 3 times! I wish the loyalty missions were at least as good as the Mafia 3 DLCs. They could have had a deep story. It could have been done so much better! So much potential there considering that one of your underbosses is someone from Mafia 2! Aaaargh :(  There is racing in the game but I haven't tried it apart from one DLC race. My game was often freezing while driving so that would be no fun racing with those fps issues. And there didn't seem to be a benefit for me to do it anyway. I could unlock a new car and some car upgrades, but I didn't feel the need for it. I already had all I needed for my crazy driving style ;)   Jokes aside, the driving in Mafia 3 felt pretty good. All controls were very responsive. I experienced the terrible driving in Watch Dogs so I was very pleased that it was not like that in Mafia 3. I like that the police in this game doesn't try to stop you for breaking the rules. You really have to kill someone with your car in front of them to make them care. And you can listen to the amazing soundtracks of the late 60s era while driving! They are so great!  [h1] Weapons and equipment  [/h1]  There were too many guns in the game for my taste. I could only carry two at the same time so I didn't get to try many of them. I usually just picked those with silencers and used them all the time. There is also so much equipment you can carry - proximity mines, grenades,  molotovs, screaming zemis, c4s, sniper supports and throwing knives.  Most of the time I was trying to do stealth takedowns and not alert all enemies if possible. I was playing the game on the hardest difficulty which makes you dead in a second or two without a cover. And enemies are smart sometimes, they know when you are reloading and they try to rush to your place where you are hiding and kill you before you finish your reload. Healing is possible by using adrenaline shots and your health doesn't regenerate without those healing items (at least not on hard difficulty).  I've never learned to use brutal takedowns, I always found it too risky to fight a person using fists when all the enemies around have guns and can kill me in a second. The tutorial says that enemies will be in shock after you perform a brutal takedown on one of them, but I never got the timing right and I died quickly so I stopped trying. Honestly there are so many ways how you can easily kill your enemies so why to bother with some quick time event brutal takedowns???  [h1] Glitches [/h1]  Mafia 3 is full of glitches. Many times mission NPCs would not talk to me if I entered the room and pressed E to talk to them right away. I would just have to reload my last checkpoint and try again. Then it worked.  I completely lost my main missions after finishing the Stones Unturned DLC. It was such a scary moment. I almost lost 70 hours of my playthrough and I would definitely not start over... I tried to reload the checkpoint to fix it and the game just kept loading forever. I got even more scared. So I restarted the game completely and it was back. Ufffff! They should have fixed things like that.  I decided to share one of the glitches with you here in the Steam review. I was healing myself in this clip at the same time I somehow died so I became a zombie and the enemies couldn't take me down but I couldn't move or shoot. --->[h1]  [url=https://clips.twitch.tv/AlluringGiftedFriseeGingerPower] Mafia 3 ""The Man of Steel"" glitch - Twitch Clip [/url]  [/h1]  [h1] Final Verdict [/h1]  Mafia 3 is not a perfect game. But everyone who loves open world games like Watch Dogs, Sleeping Dogs or even GTA games will love this one as well. If you are a fan of the first two Mafia games and you are not afraid to experience something a bit different, go for it. I think that you will not be disappointed!"
78391840,english,1,360430,"Seems this game's two main criticisms were the repetetive gameplay and bugs.  Well, I didn't encounter any gamebreaking bugs so far and maybe one or two smaller ones in my 11hrs of gameplay.  Repetition... I can understand it for the main story. I'm not too far in, but there are some recurring gameplay elements. Thing is, the gameplay itself is quite fun, so it hasn't bothered me yet.  My only other complaint would be the save checkpoints which are sometimes a bit too harsh.  So with that out of the way: here's what I think of the game.  It's goddamn great.  The story, characters, voice and motion acting are tremendous.  Especially the DLC that's included in this version, are amazing.  You can start playing once you're a bit into the story, but the stories and atmosphere are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. Plus, these missions are more linear like the old Mafia games.  In my opinion, this game is a hidden gem. Hidden because of the bad reviews it probably rightfully deserved when it launched, but now this is truly a diamond of a game.  Against all my expectations, this may be my favorite Mafia game yet.  Let's see if it remains so once I finish it, but so far so good."
107343023,english,0,360430,"The game is essentially the same mission in different locations over and over and over again. For an open world game, nothing is fleshed out and there really isn't anything to do but drive around."
69893871,english,0,360430,"all the bugs, glitches, graphical issues and overall poor quality muddy visuals from the original are in this 'Definitive edition'. it's baffling that a re-released 'remastered definitive edition' of a game can contain every single problem from the original release and introduce some new ones along with it. how embarrassing."
30935101,english,0,360430,"Ok, I need to preface this by stating the following:  1.) I was born in the early '80s. 2.) My parents were Yankees. 3.) I'm whiter than cottage cheese.  To that end I have no real idea if the racism in this game is accurate or a caricature, honestly. I suspect it's somewhere in the middle.  I both enjoyed and was frustrated by this game. It's not really a clear thumbs-up thumbs-down vote. A lot of people will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. There's a lot to do, a lot to see, and a lot to collect. However, those of us, myself included, who want a fleshed out story will be a bit lacking. The game does a lot well, but it has some glaring problems that are, frankly, unforgivable.  Here's the positives first:  1.) The soundtrack is killer. I got the game at a deep discount and the soundtrack alone is well worth what I paid for. It has a great combination of '60s rock, R&B, and pop hits (amongst others). It's a lot of fun to outrun police to the tune of ""Palisades Park"" by Freddy Cannon or have a shootout in a quarry to the tune of ""Folsom Prison Blues"" by Johnny Cash. The developers knew how to use music effectively and did it very well.  2.) The map is quite large. This is somewhat a positive AND a negative as it takes a while to get anywhere. However, the ""GPS"" system works quite well and it's very easy to get around with the help of the minimap. This leads to...  3.) The UI is (generally) well designed. When driving you have a rear view mirror and can easily spin the camera around to see what's going on behind you. The speedometer and tacometer are unobtrusive, if a bit useless. The minimap is great. While on foot, it's easy to see how much ammo you are carrying and your health/armor levels. I also never had any signifigant issues with using something I didn't intend to. The game makes it very clear what item it is you are going to do an action to. There are minor issues when two objects are placed too close to each other, but those are typically insignificant. The game also utilizes several different hotkeys to do different things, so you are never in any real danger of picking up a dead body instead of a dropped weapon.  4.) The vehicles generally behaved realistically. As someone who has driven several vehicles from the mid to late 1960s, I can confirm that they are generally just as sluggish and heavy as they are in the game. In fact, I would say the vehicles in the game perform better than their real-life counterparts.  5.) I personally enjoyed the way the game handled the full cutscenes. The jumps in time were handled well and I really liked watching them. They told the story from a Discovery channel esque ""real crime"" drama taking place in the 2010s. It was unique and I liked the idea.  Now we get to the cons. Some of these are excusable and could potentially have been fixed by patches. Some are inherent flaws in the game that cannot be fixed.  1.) The graphics are generally poor and unoptimized. I tend to ignore graphics so long as they don't royally suck. These are not great. You can tell this is a poorly done console port. This could potentially be excused if the gameplay was good, but that leads us to...  2.) The gameplay (after the first act) is dull and repetitious. The first act is done well. It hops around in time (like the cutscenes) and is scriped well. It's generally fun. Afterward, though, is a repetitious wreck. Basically, you shoot badguys and cause general havok in a specific area until the miniboss shows up. You kill him, do the shooting and havoking a second time until the second miniboss shows up. Kill him too. Then the district boss shows up. The boss levels are usually reasonably entertaining and it's clear THIS was where the real polish was done. Unfortunately you have to do this NINE TIMES. It's dull after the first few and the game doesn't really give you any good reason to want to do it again as all the districts are basically the same bunch of minigames with different settings. Even THIS would be excusable (somewhat) if the following wasn't true:  3.) The AI sucks chocolate salty balls. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst I've ever seen, but that's usually reserved for games that are broken. The AI does exactly what it's supposed to. Unfortunately, the AI is very very stupid. Case in point: run up to enemy location, hide around the wall from a bad guy, and whistle. It doesn't matter if you are on a construction site with a lot of civilian AI that's noisy as hell or a shack in the middle of the bayou; ONE SINGLE enemy will investigate. If you have two talking only ONE will investigate. If you run up to a group of five only ONE will investigate. They will ALWAYS investigate. Again, it doesn't matter where you are or if a whistle could conceivibly be a commonly heard sound. The AI will ALWAYS wander toward the sound like a sorority girl investigating a dark basement. They stroll toward you and practically BEG you to kill them. Rinse and repeat until someone finally sees you long enough for some arbitrary flag to fire and you are in unending combat.  4.) The police exist to do nothing but kill the PC. This is an extention of the prior but it needs an entry on its own. The police do not fight crime in New Bordeaux. They do not protect the innocent. They exist ONLY to kill a SINGLE PERSON: Lincoln Clay. If you get into a shootout with ANYONE and they respond, they will zero in on the PC like a AMRAAM. It doesn't matter who you're fighting or how many civilians are getting killed by the enemy's molotovs: if YOU are fighting they will try to kill YOU. There's also no system of justice either: shoot a civilian, get shot; shoot a car, get shot; shoot a mobster, get shot; break into a store, get shot; break into a telephone exchange, get shot; run over a pedestrian, get shot; lighly rearend a police car, get shot; walk too close to a cop, get shot. On the other hand, burning through a red light at 115 MPH, they don't bat an eye. Mafia I, which was released in 2002, had a VASTLY more sophisticated system of law and order. Let me repeat that: Mafia I, which is currently a FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD game, actually had a system where you had to follow the traffic laws and the cops wouldn't gun you down for a fender-bender. They also suffer from the ""GTA V effect"" and materialize from juuuust out of view and swarm you.  5.) After you finish off a ward, there's not really anything to do there. I can't fault Mafia III exclusively as this is generally a problem with open world games in general, but once you take over a ward there's not much point in ever setting foot there. It's interesting to see the businesses change when they change hands, but once you collect all the Playboys and Vargas drawings, there's not much reason to go back. This leads us to...  6.) The collectables are a tad-bit silly and really really pointless. I like vintage playboys and Vargas illustrations as much as the next man. However, this is because I am, in fact, a man. Enough said. However, this illustrates a further issue:  7.) There's not any particular ""advancement"" in the game. As far as I can tell, you are given all the clothing at the beginning of the game. This was rather disappointing to me as I hoped to unlock additional cosmetic features as I went along. This was not the case so I switched between looking like Laurence Fishburne in ""Apocalypse Now"" to Laurence Fishburne playing Malcom X to an extra from ""Shaft."" In addition, you have a large variety of weapons, that are pretty much ALL available at the beginning of the game, and are all pretty dull. The Colt 1911 was pretty much the same as the Browning 9mm which was pretty much the same as the Colt Python.  In conclusion (since I'm running low on space) the game is not really worth it IMO unless you enjoy doing the same thing over and over to really good music."
29524762,english,0,360430,"I loved Mafia 1 and Mafia 2... the gameplay in Mafia 3 was very lackluster. The game has been transformed to be a wannabe GTA, so if it's going to go there, it delivers poorly. It scratches the surface of gameplay elements we enjoy in similar-looking games like GTA, but with little freedom of choice and poor variety. I love the story idea but story alone is not enough to keep me playing until the end unless it really engages you with lead character development like in former Mafia titles. It's the same problem I have with recent Assassin's Creed games, although the AC games deliver tons of content but still manages to feel repetitive due to the side-quest nature of everything."
80666006,english,0,360430,"The story and characters are pretty good but once you've played the game for about an hour you've seen all it has to offer. Boring, repetitive and uninspired gameplay. You pick up fuses, wiretap a fuse box, maybe kill two targets and then take over a racket. That's the whole game."
45697992,english,1,360430,"[h1]Mafia lll[/h1]  Mafia lll has been a bit of a bumpy journey for me, good and bad, with mixed feelings. However, I feel the need to overall give this game a positive rating. I will go through the basics [i]without spoilers[/i] of the positive and negatives about this game.  [h1]Storyline/Cutscenes[/h1]  The setting takes places in a New Orleans fantasy during the Vietnam times, as you take place of a man named Lincoln Clay, who has returned from the war, and things turn nasty rather quickly. However, that's up to you to find out what happens.  The setting in this game is rather different than the other titles, this game does not much involved you much in the Mafia, however, you do deal with them still, just not like how it was like in the past.  The Cutscenes are good and bad at the same time. Some are just awesome, even with a gunfight with a sequence song playing in the background. However, some are just simple dialogue, where Lincoln stands still awkward, which is one of the drawbacks in the game because it's all the same when it happens. I'll get more into this at the end of my review.  Overall, the story is very good and engaging for me to continue playing the game. Each step of a territory taken with the people you are working with was one step closer to the climax. There will be a lot of gunfights, whether on foot and by car with police on your tail. The average time for me to finish the Campaign would have to be 20 hours, I did milk a lot with other side objectives and the DLC stories with my total of 40 hours.  [h1]Performance and Graphics[/h1]  Graphics are alright, but they do look like they aren't rendered correctly, and just look awful. I'm not picky with graphics, I mandatory Gameplay and Storylines more, especially for this type of game. However, sometimes the game does look damn beautiful, especially at night time. Textures would look weird, and the game just stutters bad, I MEAN BAD. IT EVEN RAINS WHEN ITS SUNNY OUT, CLEAR SKIES, IT TRIGGERS ME!   My system isn't the best, however, some people have been having issues, even with a system far better than mine. If you want a reference, I'm running High Settings with an FX 8320 and an RX 480 8GB with 16GB DDR3 average of 40-60, sometimes dipping lower with that terrible stuttering. Mafia lll is known to stutter a lot. I also had more massive stuttering occurs with a TV as a monitor when I got the game, however, it improved when I got a monitor. Again, it could be my system, however, the game has a lot of reports of lack of optimization, even on console.  Overall, if you can defeat the stutterings of eliminating it or dealing with it, you'll be fine.  [h1]The Progression and Side Activies[/h1]  Mafia lll is very, very, very repetitive, that was the one huge drawback I had about this game. It took me a long time to finish, however, taking breakers here and there, I was able to finish it eventually.   Basically here's how Mafia lll is in a nutshell:  > You go raid a place, shoot it up, steal money or break objects, interrogate this dude and repeat. > Or Chase this guy, kill him, and walk away.  You'll have certain targets to take down, which will be locked, you need to complete little strongholds or ""Operations"" in order to flush out the main person you need to take out. Again, repetitive.  Once you take down the Boss's or all Operations in a certain area or ""District"", you can choose who owns that, not going to spoil who, however.  After gaining more income, racking more to a certain District, you earn upgrades, such as guns, perks to help you such as reduce recoil, and health upgrades. You also get Hitman to assist you while in combat if needed. Cell phone jammers and car deliver, which vehicles also can be unlocked for an instant delivery. Yes, you can also upgrade your vehicles, however, nothing detailed, even less detailed than the last Mafia titles. However, I expect this honestly, I'm not too disappointed.  [U]Other Activies[/U]  You have other Activities, which include:  - Weed Operations (DLC Required: Faster Baby) - Hitman Jobs - Street Racing - Collectables such as Playboy's again - And a few more not mentioned...  Overall, the game does keep you occupied for a while, even without DLC, but Mafia lll is a game where it's all ""Fetch Quest"", which is again a huge drawback to me, and quite a few others.  [h1]My Final Summary[/h1]  [u]Simplified Pro's and Cons:[/u]  The Pros: - A very good story that was engaging to me. - A very good era, cars, location, music, it's all perfect. - Decent amount of activities - DLC's are decent as well if you have a chance to pick them up. - Awesome takedowns, I have to admit they never get old to do. - Alligators that eat you - Lincoln Clay a bad A$$ mother trucker  The Cons: - Repetitive asf - Optimization and Graphical issues - Some bugs happening where it requires a re-loading - Recycled Animations, such as Interrogations - Rather lacking the ""Mafia"" part. - ""Fetch based"" missions  Overall, the game is decent, not the worst, the game is rough. The story is good, the time/era and everything about it is awesome to me, I'm sure some may agree where I'm coming from. If you're able to by-pass the issues and actually play the game for the story and tolerate, completing the repetitive missions, I personally would say it's worth it. The DLC's aren't bad either to try, they will add more gameplay and new explorable locations and new characters to meet, but those will be separate reviews.  Is it the best Mafia game? No, not in my opinion, however, it's still good and exceptional. Well, is this worth Full Price? No, I honestly would highly recommend $15 at least, even better you can snag it with DLC at that price. When the game launched on its first good sale, I got the game and it's DLC for only $17!  Either way, Lincoln Clay has been fun to play as through my journey playing Mafia lll, even though it took my awhile to complete the story, I feel satisfied on the ending, and meeting some old friends."
50100294,english,0,360430,"When this game first came out, all I kept reading was how buggy it was. I chose not to get it, which was a shame because I was such a fan of the Mafia series to date, but I am not the type of person who can spend launch prices on a game and overlook bugs. So, instead, I waited. For a long, long... long... time. And I hate to say everyone, it was not in any way worth the wait.  I wanted to like this game. The characters all seemed really intriguing right from the start, and I was liking the environment a lot. But it took less than four hours of game-play to realize if I wasn't stuck in a repetitive task it was solely because the game had decided to thrust me into another unbearably long cut-scene, often right in the middle of combat. A few hours later, I found myself hitting an unskippable cut-scene, getting up, making my way downstairs, making a cup of tea, putting on the TV, and getting lost in a show entirely forgetting I was even playing this game only to come back to find my character standing there like a fool.  I need to be fair in this review and say I haven't finished it yet. But the reality is, I don't want to. I have no desire to boot it up anymore, I have no interest in launching into the game to drive to a location, whistle a few times, stealth kill everyone without any challenge, and then wait 25 minutes while the game tries to teach me a lesson about how messed up the US government used to be. It's just.. so...... boring."
94254649,english,1,360430,"This game gets hated on for it's repetitiveness, and rightfully so... But the game has a charm I can't quite figure out."
191556987,english,0,360430,"The current top review kinda says it all. This game should be in a neutral category. I usually keep refraining from writing reviews, but had to do it.   Although the setting is awesome and the racial tension is suspense, the gameplay and gameworld are lackluster. I like side missions, however you always have to drive through the ENTIRE map do complete them in Mafia 3. Which is not a problem in a game like GTA but here... To drive 5-10min in a barren landscape with heavy pop-in is just so.. boring.  The story starts off violently good. You get a reason, you get a narrative etc. But after two hours it just repeats itself. Drive to District A, kill everyone and capture the District. Drive to B, do the same all over again.  I don't leave games unplayed. Today I did."
77743457,english,0,360430,Bad optimization... the game got even worse after update to Definitive Edition
139797223,english,1,360430,Despite the fact that this game isnt popular with MAFIA fans (they hate this part actually) I pretty much enjoyed this part  1.One of the best soundtracks 2.1970's magnificant atmosphere 3.Face mimics and nice cutscenes  i would say its a OK Game  7.5/10
188164700,english,1,360430,"I enjoyed this game back in the days after its release and Im enjoying it even more now. Here is why. Previous two Mafia games were heavily story driven since you had one story mission after another. This one is closer to the classic ""GTA"" open world formula with many side missions to do (if you want).  I don't mind when games get repetitive if the gameplay itself is fun. And boy Im having fun with this one! The action, animations and ragdoll physics are so much fun that after finishing one firefight I can't wait to start another. One of my most favourite things are melee finishers. Simply get close to your enemy and press Q key and Lincoln  will perform a finisher depending on which weapon you are carrying. It was the exact same way (even the Q key) in 2005 Punisher game. You can also try stealthy approach or later in the game you can just call in a hitman squad and enjoy the firefight from afar. The choice is yours.  Story is actually very good and especially the acting. You just don't see a cutscene after every finished mission like in the previous games. Story narrative reminds me mostly of Guy Ritchie's gangster movies with little bit of Martin Scorsese mixed into it but at some points you also feel like being in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood since it takes place in the same time period and even contains  some songs that were later used in that movie.  Which brings me to the soundtrack - it's simply amazing. What can I say, one classic song after another. You will not want to turn off the radio station!  What about our main character Lincoln Clay? Im so happy that once more we can have some ""walking tank"" type of character. He is basically like Jack Reacher mixed with the Punisher. For a person like me who grew up on Arnold Schwarzenegger movies it's just another plus. And like a mentioned before the fighting and everything around it is just so much fun. Some people say that the open world is empty and there's not much to do except the side missions. To be fair it wasn't much different in previous games. Map basically served only to get from point A to point B to complete the story mission. In this you actually have things to do, which gives you more money, make things easier for you (like if you eliminate enemy enforcers they won't be bothering you later in the game) and your decisions even have influence on the story since there are several different ways how you can progress. Like in all previous instalments here as well was environment created with great attention to detail that makes you want to just walk around and breathe in the atmosphere. What makes the environment feel alive are the npcs. They have many different dialogs and even reacting on what's happening in the story as the game progress.  At one point after Sammy's bar gets repaired you can stop by to have a drink there which is a nice touch since I always liked to be able to immerse myself into the game doing all those little unnecessary things like being able to eat or drink and stuff like that. There is also one nice little detail some of us appreciate and which is usually overlooked in most pc games and that's the walking button. You can just switch between walk and run.  In case of technical issues - Im only having one. Which is that sometimes when you start the game it for some reason crashes back to desktop after the opening logos. Little annoying but all I have to do is just to start the game again and all over sudden it works just fine. I heard that switching the compatibility to Windows 7 solves the problem but I didn't bother to test it. Other than that game works just fine on max details. Not a single crash during the gameplay. My pc is almost as old as the game, which is Ryzen 5 1600, 16gb ram and GeForce 1060 (and Windows 10). Game can look gorgeous at times but I suggest turning off the depth of field and motion blur to make it look less blurry.  So If you like this genre I really think that you should give it a try. Im not afraid to say that this game is very underrated. It is on 75% sale very often and for that price you really can't go wrong.  You can pray on the way up! - Lincoln Clay  Update: I completely forgot that later in the game you can grow weed and even make your own strains! 10/10!"
187472933,english,0,360430,"The beginning was probably the best part of the game, it had story, action, deep moments and character development. Then AFTER the prolouge you go shoot a guy, rob a place and maybe even blow up a warehouse, sounds fun right? Now do that for every single god damn boss in the game :) There is also many bugs, light issues, crashes and even talking to a guy to start a mission won't work"
25915563,english,0,360430,"TL/DR: save yourself some time and money if you're new to the mafia franchise and buy mafia 2.  *UPDATED* for those interested review follows:  ♥♥♥♥ textures (muddy,grainy, blurry with some SERIOUSLY low res roads walls and general environment) that look like they were ripped straight out of Prototype (a game from 2008 WTF 2K?),   story is basically shadow of mordor set in new orleans (Same premise same gameplay BUT NOW WITH GUNS AND CARS! Boss mechanics and story points are basically ripped sraight from Shadow of Mordor along with the whole story being near identical... but being set in 1960's america) standard revenge storyline low stress,   I've noticed a whole lot of people commenting on the story of the game and how ""brave"" the developers were to take on a troubled era in American history (rampant racism being the main trouble) and while I might not have been alive in the 1960's (I'm 20) i do feel compelled to comment on the use of racism in this game: It appears that the use of racism is purely there as fluff to distract from the fact that the character interaction is really non-existent and very poorly written (probably in an attempt to make you feel something that the character fail to evoke) with completely forgettable characters being thrust forward and never actually developed or fleshed out. You can read more about them in the in game bio screens but from a pure storytelling perspective they are basically flat hollow mission givers with no real reason to care about them or Lincoln's straight Shadow of Mordor campaign or even Lincoln himself! I personally couldn't tell you a damn thing about any of the characters I met during my 5/6 hours with the game and that's a real shame.  rinse and repeat missions (There's so ♥♥♥♥ING MANY of these they got boring and repetitive extremely quickly), often recycling the same layouts and environments for different ""missions"" even enemy placements have very little variation,  crap controls (mouse acceleration with no off switch? c'mon guys that's just lazy/no working key rebind system? ♥♥♥♥ sake),   *FIXED* 30FPS lock out of the box (I know its been said like a million times but it matters),   HOWEVER this now presents the issue pertaining to maintaining a consistent 60fps this game running on my system on high reaches 40fps with the fps locked to 60 NOW i would like to take the time to outline the system that this game is running on:  Intel Core i7 5960X @ 4.5 Ghz 16 GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum at 2400 Mhz 2 EVGA GTX 980 ti's 6GB in SLI (the system req's call for a single 290X or 780 from 2013...) Samsung 850 Evo Pro 1TB All sitting on a ASUS Rampage V Extreme All custom watercooled  this system should eat this game up and spit it the ♥♥♥♥ out 3 times over ESPECIALLY as it runs Witcher 3 on ultra at a solid 60FPS without breaking a sweat, this brings the issue up of just poor optimisation for the PC platform and explains why they didn't put full 60 on from the start. PC was an afterthought, a cliff note, a ""oh ♥♥♥♥ we forgot do that"" moment and thats not right we bought the game same as everyone else treat us with at least a little ♥♥♥♥ing respect you did willfully take our money.   no SLI support,   menu's are a joke, blurry aliased text (if you play at a res higher than 1080p) CLEARLY designed for controllers not a mouse and keyboard (as in it has no mouse input at all apart from in maybe the new game section but still displays the cursor),  if you want to play in 21:9 good luck dealing with all the artifacting that comes with it (lighting bugs, discolouration, interface designs e.g the low health blood that appears only covers a 16:9 space...) including a rave party at the edges of the screen whenever you go indoors (spoiler alert you might have to do that quite a bit),   texture pop in is a MAJOR issue with this game along with a HIDEOUS draw distance that means things get properly rendered when they're 10 ft away (by rendered i of course mean that the textures just pop into existence extremely noticeably)   enemies take 1/2 to a full mag to kill if not shot in the head and even then its not a sure thing (the ♥♥♥♥ am I fighting luke cage? I was playing the game on medium btw mother ♥♥♥♥ers take 7 shots in the chest and keep walking)  the police system that was in mafia 2 has been stripped down to cops shoot on sight if you run a red light (what happened to the fine/arrest/shoot/wanted system?)  cover system works well if not a little temperamental on occasion  shooting felt fine but i found myself constantly running out of ammo due to the aforementioned Luke Cage esque enemies  sneak felt like beating up on quadriplegic kids because the AI is legit totally incapable of seeing you crouched in front of them  driving is either PEDAL TO THE METAL or FULL STOP there is no in between and you'll spend most of your time wrestling for control of the car (the game then has the cheek to offer you ""simulation driving"" to make is harder... what were they thinking...)  the standard formula of go here kill this was a common theme... wait ... the only theme that ran though this game and the story only gave context (sometimes it's really paper thin) as to why you are doing what your doing  the game also has these kind-of not cutscenes but cutscenes where you and the person you're meeting with stand awkwardly and wooden with dialogue playing overtop it (this happens WAY more than it should) normally preceeding you going to a place and shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of it like 90% of the other missions that Clay will be undertaking  lastly the options menu is a disaster the graphics settings seem to do nothing to the look of the game having swapped from high to low and low to high the only real difference I could see was the ambient occlusion was missing on the low preset but texture difference is basically non existant (Im starting to think that low and high are the same thing in the config file)  huge disappointment was a game that i was really looking forward to... :(  UPDATE: Steam won't refund me my money so i guess it's only fair that IF (< big if) any of this ♥♥♥♥ gets fixed i will update this review accordingly"
138356843,english,0,360430,"Gameplay wise this game is literally just 35+ hours of doing the same exact thing over and over again. Story wise, it’s decent but just doesn’t feel like a Mafia game, it feels more like a spin-off."
25900757,english,0,360430,"This game isnt exactly a game of the year in my opinion, but ill make a list below of positives and negatives. Remember, these are only my opinions.  [h1]Positive[/h1] [list]     [*]Story seems quite interesting     [*]Gunplay is really fun     [*]Map seems okay     [*]I really like the trash talk of AI     [*]Some animations are really good, almost amazing.     [*]Being able to drive up with a pink beetle, murder enemy enforcer then driving away with pink beetle while they are shootin at you. [/list]  [h1]Negative[/h1] [list]     [*]Driving feels like you are driving on ice and all cars feel like supercars     [*]I really hate games nowdays that make the game challenging by making enemies bullet sponges.  Once I shot one guy 4 times in the upperbody and he didnt die...     [*]Lack of customization. Remember when you could buy clothing in Mafia II? Or customize your car? Well not anymore. You can upgrade your car's performance and thats about it.     [*]Icons floating and showing where weapons, cash and every other collectible things are.     [*] It is really easy. Havent died once yet.. When you are close to dying just run behind cover or pump some adrenaline into you and you are good to go.     [*]Car damage models are horrible.     [*]Cars sound like beefed vacuumcleaners.     [*]Lincoln having that stupid superpower that is plaguing every game nowdays. Seeing trough walls and enemies glowing bright red.      [*]Lincoln doesnt have any animations or ragdoll when he is hit by a car. If a car hits you, you will slide with the car untill you slide off front of the car. [/list] Overall it feels too arcady for me. Only thing that I play it for now is the story. The game itself spoils a lot of the story but I want to see what happens.  I will play it but wont enjoy it as much as Mafia II"
77013818,english,0,360430,"There is not a single reason to call this game ""Mafia"". There are no families, loyalty, fancy clothes, cars or betrayal. There is no proper story, and the game is very repetitive. You go some place, kill everyone, deal damage and kill the boss, thats all. The open world is so dead, AI is very stupid, both the henchman and normal people driving around the city. Car mechanics are very bad, there is no car damage at all. Graphics are bad, blurry. To be honest, this game has the best licenced I've heard for a while, its like they spent all the money for the music, instead of developing the game."
36538437,english,0,360430,"Some pros and cons after few hours in game.  Pros: - Characters, interesting and with deep backstories - Sound is excellent - Location has so much to offer - Open world without loading screens - Interesting gameplay mechanics - Inspired by the blaxploitation movies for sure  Cons: - Boring AF - Bugs everywhere - It's not a MAFIA story, it's just a ""generic revenge story"" with mobs - territories and mafia wars are a simple copy-paste from The Godfather 2 game - You can't collect cars, or houses or clothes but the game wants you to become the richest gangster in the USA - 'whistle', ""who's there?"", kill the guy in stealth mode, go on with other 5000 henchmen  It's not a full no no, it's a ""meh, what a wasted opportunity"""
64130379,english,0,360430,"The first 2 hours in this game is amazing, it feels like it could win the GOTY title because of its masterful storytelling and character shaping, I enjoyed it very much and felt like I was watching a nice movie.  But the game got the mixed reviews for a reason. It quickly becomes repetitive after you're allowed to free roam in the city. Literally every mission you do is to go to a spot to kill & interrogate certain targets and then receive further information and go to the next spot doing the exact same thing until you finally liberate all the districts for your 3 underbosses which is pretty much everything this game has to offer, it really feels like a chore to do and many people hate it because of that.   But the game starts to get a little bit more interesting again after I liberated the first 3 districts. At least now there are races I can do and I get to modify my cars, it's fun because the driving (and the shooting) in this game feels pretty good. But srsly I dunno what they were thinking, the races are not available at first, you have to grind through the first 10+ hours of the game in order to be able to race. I believe the majority of the players just quit before they even know there are races in the game.  Overall I think this game could've been so much better, the demo back in 2015 looks so good that it's hard not to be sold on the game, I dunno what happened later that could make the game so different from what it looked like in the demo, maybe the lack of money? It's such a shame."

Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales.  This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me."

It had an actual story, interesting characters, it was even funny at times, and I couldn't understand why the rating was so low. But then the prologue ended, and shit hit the ceiling. You suddenly have to do the exact same thing over and over again. Go there, kill this guy, move over there, kill this guy... over and over and over and over and over again. It's like the definition of insanity, and it's a pity, because the prologue was really promising. Still, the game has its moments (if you can survive the repetitive boredom), great characters and voice acting, and an awesome soundtrack (though even that starts to piss you off after a couple of hours listening to the same song). I'd rather not say anything about the graphics."

83600002,english,0,360430,"Mafia III: Definitive Edition is an action-adventure open-world game. You are Lincoln Clay, a former criminal and Vietnam veteran. You are forced to return to a life of crime to help your family settle problems with the local Mafia family. It does not take long and the Mafia betray and murder your family, so you are going on a quest for revenge. Over time Lincoln is slowly building a criminal empire.  On its release Mafia III was full of bugs, over time it was patched and was good in terms of performance but then came the Definitve Edition upgrade... Now the game is riddled with graphical bugs, sound bugs (ALT+TAB removed the sounds for me), cut scenes are sometimes not working, some characters which should have opened a door for me to proceed stucked and I had to reload the checkpoint, and the performance overall is worse compared to the former version. The graphics are good. The music is also good and fits to the time, however there could be more songs in the radio (you can listen to radio channels, like in GTA). The characters and the story are uninteresting from my point of view. It does not feel like playing in the Mafia world. The game (especially in the later part) is pretty boring and annoying. The missions are totally repetetive (interrogate a person, destroy that and that and kill a special guy...repeat). So, I actually wished that the game was shorter, as it was a torture to do the same stuff again and again. Mafia III: Definitive Edition is a disapointment.

Mafia 3 is not even good as Mafia II but still OK game. Storyline is so simple about revenge, gameplay and missions seems boring sometimes, graphic details are good but sometimes not as beautiful as it should be."
149999173,english,0,360430,"A Funny Story   The place named New Bordeaux in the game is Saint Denis in Red Dead Redemption 2, and this is one of the reasons why RDR2 was postponed. The name of the city in the game was originally going to be New Bordeaux, but they changed it to Saint Denis.  Because the name of this city name was already used in Mafia 3 and since Rockstar did not want to use this name, they decided to completely change the name of the city.  Some of the new additions are nice, but overdoing it and straying from the main path of the series must have killed the game, and also the optimization is still a disgrace.  But unfortunately, since there are some small good details, I can never praise such a game because this game is completely a hideout cleaning simulator and it makes you repeat the same thing over and over, it is literally a disgrace and very boring."
55049510,english,1,360430,"I really enjoyed Mafia 3, and this is coming from someone that has also played Mafia 2. There seems to be a lot of criticism towards this game, which is a shame because it's honestly not terrible. The gameplay is repetitive, sure. Plenty of features appear under-cooked and the world could've used some more activities. But these things really didn't bother me - for everything Mafia 3 does wrong, it makes up for it with a stellar soundtrack, vibrant setting, good characters and overall decent storytelling. It's not on Mafia 2 levels by any means, but it isn't nearly as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. I thought Lincoln was a fine protagonist, he suits the ""revenge story"" avenger-role well - and has some of the most memorable appearances in cutscenes.  Speaking of cutscenes, they're beautifully directed and could almost stand on their own as a short film series of sorts. Each set-piece is brutal and memorable. The documentary bits with Father James were great, as were Lincoln's meetings with Donovan. Plenty of cinematic symbolism and great camera angles interspursed with historical imagery. Sure, they're pre-rendered CGI, but I still loved them regardless. M3's motion capture is excellent too, adding to the emotional impact in cutscenes.  If you're going to get this game for one reason, get it for the side content, which is where M3 is at its best I think. It has an original score, which is excellent, and a varied radio selection with plenty of iconic artists from the period ranging from blues, soul, country, and psychedelic/garage rock. I also really enjoyed the collectibles, they evoke Mafia 3's setting well and are fun to read through. The inclusion of character bios was also appreciated; the amount of written content in M3 is honestly immense. Smaller content like the handwritten notes you'd find in racket hideouts also really added to the atmosphere. Lincoln's journal gives you a further insight into his experiences throughout the plot.  Speaking of rackets, I actually really enjoyed this mechanic. As you progress through the story and take over districts, it actually feels like you're tearing away at a rival criminal enterprise and are taking over from the inside. The racket missions are nothing to write home about, but still provide a way to make extra money after the main story. Each safehouse is detailed and distinctive, and populated with NPCs, providing a place to bunker down if you're being pursued by the police and supplying you with extra adrenaline shots and body armor. Cash also serves a purpose in gameplay, and you'll want to store it in your safe as soon as possible. If you die without depositing your cash, you will lose some of it. This ensures you aren't careless with your supplies and gives a sense of urgency. It's best to deposit all of your cash before tackling some of the more difficult enemy safehouses.  I also thought the ""marker"" and services system was great because it means you have a reason to complete side missions for each underboss and remain loyal. You'll want to complete these early in the game and save up your service markers, because you will certainly be needing them - like the ability to halt police pursuits, hijack the phone lines so witnesses can't call for the police, and call for hitmen to aid you in combat. Each racket has a clear and defined difficulty curve as you progress through the story - I never once had to adjust the difficulty setting, which I've had to deal with in plenty of other games with ""artificial"" rises in difficulty where it starts to feel cheap. This was never an issue for me in M3.  [h1]TL;DR - Recommended,[/h1] get this game (perhaps on a sale though). I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it, despite its flaws."
25930497,english,1,360430,"Game is 30fps, yes but one of the smoothest 30fps i've experienced in a PC game. The open world is as basic as it gets, but who is here for the open world aspect really? The combat is the games best feature and its pretty satisfying compare to other open world game. The gunplay is already better than your GTAV gunplay. Theres complaints about the enemies A.I, which ive experienced some dumb moments. Enemies all reacting the same and make the same bad decisions, even breaking aggressive approaches in combat while in a gun fight, to go into stealth A.I animation with my character right in front of clear view.   Honestly the game feels like a early access game. I found out that the devs will be adding the option to change characters clothes after the game launch? sign of a rushed game? I've so far small glitches. The graphics are hit and miss, but its decent.   The story is top-notch.   As much as i want my 60fps, i can't deny that this game isnt fully playable. i've had similar bad experience with batman arkham knights and even witcher 3 at launch. The experience for these games got better as the patches rolled in, so i expect the same for this.   The game is pretty playable and worth owning, be it now or later. Its just going to take some patch work, as with many games on the pc, to reach full potential.  PS: I think the devs made some pretty bad mistake with this game. I wish i could of lend some ideas for the game. game has lost potential."
91458320,english,0,360430,"The game was fine before they added the 2K launcher. Now when you click to start game, you get a launcher than supposedly contacts 2K servers, and checks something (no permission from the user requested).  So you click to get launcher, click to start game, wonder about what the launcher (which wasn't necessary before) is doing in the background, and then click to exit game, and exit the launcher.  At what point did the devs in that company sit around a table and decide that this was what the game needed? I'd recommend their company gets some serious devs. The type that slim down the crap and maximise the gaming experience.  Uninstalled. Shame. Bought it a few months ago, and the game was largely fine, if occasionally buggy. If this is them sorting it, the code must have been seriously messed up, and the new devs were even more useless. Hope you read this devs. Be ashamed of yourselves.  DO NOT BUY."

The graphics and narration scenes along with the gameplay and storyline had me reeled in. But after about 4 hours of gameplay, the special missions that made it so fun were gone. Now it's a bunch of go and kill or interrogate ""Jerry"" with no purpose behind it. This game had a great start and it feels unfinished and rushed to be honest. Go spend your money elsewhere."

[*]Incredibly repetitive gameplay     [*]Needlessly difficult achievements, since certain counters reset at every restart of the game     [*]Missing details that were present in Mafia I and II, which made the game much more immersive (e.g. police chasing you if you drive too fast) [/list] I think I could go on a bit longer.  And the worst of it, all of these issues appear to have already been present in the original Mafia III game, and nobody bothered to fix any of it in the Definitive Edition.  The idea of the game is not bad in terms of its story, but the way this game is designed is just incredibly boring and annoying. Huge downgrade from the 2 previous games if you ask me. It hurts to say it, since I really liked the Mafia series so far, but I just can't recommend this game to anyone."
70437460,english,0,360430,"The game itself is good, but tedious. Drive, talk to somebody, drive to the place they asked and shoot they guy they asked, then repeat. Also, the PC port is horrendous. Will the game randomly change resolution? Will it freeze and crash on startup? You never know, and neither does the game."
101094548,english,1,360430,"Having played the other Mafia games, I personally really enjoy this one. Is it my favourite? Not necessarily. However, I really loved the story and I found myself very attached to the characters. I found that they were all pretty unique, and I was thoroughly pleased to see Vito make an appearance. I will someday replay the game to see how it plays out with the other characters being in charge, but for now I'm satisfied.  I understand the frustration behind doing virtually the same task for each district, which is killing mob bosses and or interrogating them, destroying rackets, etc. At one point it was annoying but I did realise that it did have a significance to the story of the game, to some extent. They could've made that part more interesting, maybe have some unique scenarios for the different districts, and they could've also used different player models! I found it strange that the same henchmen that I killed were suddenly revived and working for the racket I just secured... strange. With the definitive edition I found that there were a few graphical glitches that took away from the immersion of driving aesthetically pleasing muscle cars whilst listening to 60s rock. Some cut scenes occasionally caused the game to freeze, which became a nuisance at times.  I would still recommend this to someone who hasn't played it, and I agree that it isn't for everyone, but I really like the liberty of completing different missions instead of only doing the main story, and just senselessly killing racists in freeroam. It definitely doesn't follow the traditional Mafia game progression but I can still appreciate the length of the story. If you're looking for something that resembles the previous Mafia games you may be disappointed. I think it's still worth a try, especially at its discounted price."

26027640,english,0,360430,"I've played through the game twice, A majority of my playing time is offline thus my hours aren't reflecting actual time in-game.  Good game but still feels as though we're being guided along the rails. This feels like a step back from Mafia 2. No clothes shops, no car workshops, no gas stations. Graphics were pretty blah out of the box, but after the patch that unlocked FPS and a ReShade preset, the game looks pretty good on a 1070 GTX. It ran consistently, based on the Steam overlay, at 56-57 FPS.  Pros:  -Little details - reactions to PC, witnesses calling in crimes, etc. The city feels alive.  -Environmental/Weather system (people use umbrellas when it's raining, streets get wet when it rains, and they gradually dry after rains)  -Story is very good  -Voice acting is exceptional  Cons:  -Weather system - sometimes it rained for days at a time, and weather changed far too abruptly at times.   -Side missions to increase racket income are repetitive and tedious. This is where a lot of time in the game will be spent as objectives are clear on the other side of the map from you.  -Enemy and Police AI needs some serious attention. Enemies were completely inept unless it was a scripted event. As far as police: No speeding tickets, I could ram into cars all day in front of police but if I accidentally bumped a civilian a 5 state all points bulletin happened.   -Motorist AI is horrendous. I experienced huge traffic jams in some areas of the city which made some missions impossible to complete.  -Buggy:  Had dual Cassandras and Burkes when I did the last of their personal missions, boats spawing on land, cars I needed to steal blowing up for no apparent reason before I could get to them. Disappearing icons - being told to go talk to so and so (while doing racket earning missions) and not being able to as the icons didn't appear on the map. My ""GPS"" path displayed would bug out occasionally turning into some super wide path that was impossible to follow, and many more.  -Unless you're a completionist, there's zero replay value. As stated above, racket earnings missions are extremely tedious and that alone is reason for me not to want to touch this game again.  -Locations get reused. ""Hey kill a pimp here.."" 30 minutes later, hey the boss is so dumb he went back to the same location the pimp was at. Kill him there."" With so many locations possible, this is just pure laziness.  -Different endings but really doesn't feel like it means much, because there's nothing after the little ending spiels. What happened to ""open world games"" letting the player continue playing after the main story is finished? This game could be so much more..  -DLC: First DLC, through free, offered outfits that should have shipped with the game.  tl;dr Good game if you're a ""one and done"" player. If you're looking for replay value I'd wait and see what future patches and/or DLC offer. As of now I can't recommend the game. It's buggy, should have never shipped with a 30 fps lock for PC players, and feels more hollow than it's predecessor.   *review edited to reflect release of first DLC*"

97149182,english,0,360430,"Fix for launcher issue:  Under steam right click on the game and go to Mafia 3 > Properties In the launch options at the bottom of the window, add the following command ensuring the location is correct:  ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mafia III\Mafia3DefinitiveEdition.exe"" %command%  Keep the quotations etc. just copy and paste so the exe file launches with %command% and it works. I'll keep my review as it was, below and update if/when I complete the game (assuming no other hitches)  I was enjoying the game, it looks great, story is good and it's an enjoyable setting, although gameplay loop is a little repetitive.  After 5 hours of play time, I cannot get past the launcher. Steam says its running, 2k launcher opens, but when I click on play it shows its running, and within seconds it stops and nothing loads. After a quick search, it seems like this is a common problem and reinstalling visual c++ redistributable didnt fix it, so I guess i'm done with the game. Shame as I was looking forward to finishing it and until now I had looked past the negative reviews and was enjoying it.   Basically, dont waste your time with it: ssems 2k have had this problem for some time and still have not resolved it so I dont hold hope that they will do now (Aug 2021)."
177702181,english,0,360430,"Good story, beautiful game. But, it has too many annoying bugs and glitches even years after released. I had to repeat some missions due to story not continuing certain points especially when chasing Greco with Vito, stupid cars also got destroyed too fast. The mission design is also repetitive that you better use a mod to reduce those tasks. Also, no fast travel in this open world, especially when I want to get back to the herb house for money. Finally, it really needs a manual save to load when you make mistakes or something. It could've been great, but 2K and Hangar 13 fcked it up with their laziness to fix it. The negative reviews are well deserved."
92753278,english,0,360430,"I first bought this game about 1.5 year ago, back when it was still just your regular Mafia 3 and not the illustrious Mafia 3: Definitive Edition. I actually liked it more than most - yeah, it was repetitive and some of the design choices I found just baffling, but still... it was fun enough to keep me going. Until, that is, I ran into a vicious little gamebreaking bug that caused my game to freeze on an infinite loadscreen.   Got frustrated, got over it, uninstalled the game, thinking I might give it another shot should they ever patch it up.   So, yeah, it's been a year and a half. Did they fix it?  Nope.   Real fuckin' definitve, guys."
134945692,english,0,360430,"One of the rare times where I wish Steam had a neutral recommendation. I think the story is a great idea on paper and the actual cutscenes, radio tunes and voice acting is pretty good. I love the idea of a mob revenge story set during the civil rights era where you play as a guy taking back his city, racket by racket, to avenge those close to him who were killed by the Italian mafia. It's way different than the first two games in tone, now you have more than just an opposing mob and the police force after you, you have actual racist, hate groups, Haitians and corrupt politicians as well. It feels serious, yet I cannot say the gameplay does the story and tone justice. Like everyone has said at this point, it is REPETITIVE. The majority of these missions play out exactly like this: drive to a district to talk to an NPC about a nearby racket that an enemy has conjured up, go to the same three mission types in the district and complete them till the game says you caused enough damage in funds to that racket, then go back to that same NPC and they will give you the exact location of the person who ran that racket, then go back to one of the mission areas you already completed and kill that guy, you take control over the racket, mission completed. Do that about fifteen or so times to take over the entire county and maybe you'll get a fun mission or two. There is optional missions, but these play out the same way, deliver this vehicle and kill this guy, literally all of them! And the thing is, the actual shooting and driving is fine, but it's just so boring seeing the same death animations, the same buildings, the same enemies over and over! Don't get me wrong, there is fun to be had, these repetitive missions weren't boring at first. It was just when I realized after a few hours of taking over rackets, that was almost the entire game! I wanted variety just like the first two games had. There was driving missions, sneaking missions, missions where you had to exclusively go in guns blazing and maybe a few that combined these elements in one big mission. I will also admit that these games didn't go out on the open world aspect, but it was for the better, because look at Mafia 3's version. I would be surprised if anyone actually liked this one over the previous two games. The actual story missions are decent, they have great cutscenes and I love the interactions between characters. Actually going inside a different building or area was a breath of fresh air. It was awesome seeing Vito again and working alongside him throughout the game. The problem is, they come way too far in between the racketeering junk. A big smack in the face? The DLCs have better mission designs! ""Faster, Baby!"" is the best one because you can destroy an entire county with this bada** vehicle and create your own weed strains, it's cool and the story for it is action packed all the way. Final thoughts: Mafia 3 is a disappointment and basically junk food. It's every mediocre open world game, Frankenstein stitched together with an interesting story and a 60's setting."
182893924,english,0,360430,"Mafia III is a game where you go from point A to point B to shoot a lot of guys before going back to point A to talk to a person to go shoot some more guys, usually ending in a mildly interesting set piece mission.  It's been done a thousand times before, and it's not what people come to play the Mafia series for."
161988765,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 has both positive and negative aspects. A game that everyone had great hopes for.  ✅Soundtrack - the music is perfectly matched to the game, which takes place in 1968, ✅the story of the main character - memorable, allowing you to feel the role of a person who only wants revenge, ✅supporting characters - their presentation and manner of being in the game add an interesting atmosphere, ✅ prologue and story missions - a very interesting and engaging prologue that allows you to feel the atmosphere and story missions done at a very high level, ✅shooting system - we have pistols, rifles, snipers, shotguns and several unique weapons at our disposal. Perfect refinement of shotgun shooting, you can feel that you have a strong weapon.   ➖side missions - repetitive, interesting at the beginning, but after a few hours of gameplay boring and tiring, ➖ damage to vehicles - after hitting another vehicle at high speed, there is not much damage, but after hitting bushes or a fire hydrant, our vehicle is no longer suitable for driving, ➖NPCs - we are often lost by enemies, fighting them in some locations is very simple, there is no challenge at all, ➖police - I miss tickets for speeding or road collisions, the police in Mafi 3 are practically useless."
166578693,english,0,360430,"Honestly it's more of a meh for me. The story is interesting and funny, but is overshadowed by the repetitive game-play, go here kill this guy, than go kill these group of guys and get a main mission about killing this main guy. That is the entire game-play cycle, start to finish. The endings are honestly lackluster, and leave a lot to be desired.   I would recommend you pick it up in sale, third party, or at least buy the trilogy which would net you more bang for your buck. A cool concept and great story weighed down by horrible game-play."

122396465,english,0,360430,"I finally managed to play this game, and finish it as well. Although I must admit I had fun playing it, I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone who does not know the Mafia game lore. If you have not played the previous games, this game is not for you, and if you played them, the ocassional nostalgia is what keeps you going. What I mean by that are the following positives of this game: + The story of the game is interesting, the protagonist is very well picked and introduced.  + You meet Vito Scaletta, the protagonist of Mafia 2, and if you're lucky, you might meet more Mafia 2 characters + Since I played the Definitive edition I had access to all DLCs which were interesting both story and content-wise +Stealth in this game is amazing, whether it's the silencer or takedowns, also throwing knives as dlc content were an awesome addition + The soundtrack is very good. I think that this pretty much sums up the positive aspects of the game for me personally, so let's move on to the negatives:  - As soon as I started the game, I had to try multiple options in the settings for the game to be playable. This game has been released long enough, there should've been some kind of a patch already to fix this, because playing on lowest settings is really hard to look at an unable to play with. - The game crashed rarely, but it crashed indeed.  - GPS has a mind of its own. If the mission allows multiple targets as a choice and I pick the closest one, I expect the gps to stay focused on that point without changing it to a further one. Why should I go from Point Verdun all the way to the Bayou if what I'm looking for can also be found in Point Verdun?  - More customization options, but worse customization options.  - The game is very much repetitive. If I didn't have the DLCs to change it up a bit, I would get bored much easier and quicker, which I eventually did after I finished the DLCs.   This game is actually not that bad, it has a hidden potential, but it also has many many things that need to be fixed. It is playable, it is mildly enjoyable, but it is mostly repetitive and unstable."
165231026,english,1,360430,"I get why people like it less than the other Mafia games, as it's very dissimilar. It's more of a Grand Theft Auto than anything else. The mission are repetitive indeed, and the enemy NPC's are basically walking practice dummies, but it is what it is - 50+ hours of casual fun. Loved the setting, rarely have I seen a city so well reproduced. The story itself, the diverse cast of side characters and backgrounds, and the music, were all excellent. I loved it, might not be everyone's cup of tea but I've enjoyed it just as much as I've enjoyed GTA games back in the day."
79765478,english,1,360430,"It plays like it came out in 2009 vs. 2016, but I'd recommend a play through anyway.  You have 2 choices of play style: Sneak or shoot em' out. If you sneak, there is a huge flaw in game mechanics. Each enemy will ""search"" for you and follow the exact same path the last one did allowing you to essentially stand there and knife them one by one until the whole place is empty. Boring, right? If you don't stand there, the enemies are still on this one path of searching and it just messes the game up. I suggest just shooting em. Go in with guns for the most part.   Story is great and the cut scenes don't drag out, however, it does become a sort of grind after several hours. Reminds me of GTA - drive over here, kill this person, drive back. Drive here.. etc etc.   Still recommend on sale as a time-consuming open world game."
118420123,english,0,360430,"I actually like this game but I can't recommend because it is very poorly optimized for PC and runs like garbage. The story is decent and the game play is ok but does get highly repetitive. Play this one on console if you have to, it's a much better experience"
25911615,english,0,360430,"Updated: This is not an acceptable game for 2016. The amount of glitches, repetitiveness, and lack of other missions, and jobs to do after you complete the story is poor. Mafia 3 tried hard to bring back the Mafia series, but it crashed and burned. I had so much hope for this game, but it turned out to be another No Man's Sky of 2016.  Original Post Below: This great video by CrowbCat shows the many things wrong with Mafia III PC version. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  This is what happens when you give a good game series to a different developer who has no idea on how to make proper video games. I had so high hopes for this game, but I was let down once again by the gaming industry.  This game is so awful. When I decided to play on PC, it was because I have a choice. I could choose my hardware, my software, my resolution, my framerate, and my graphics, but what Hangar 13 did is unacceptable. They locked the game to 30FPS, and their reason for that is: ""The team has been hard at work ensuring that Mafia III’s performance is consistent across all platforms, and right now the game runs at a solid 30 frames-per-second.""   That's the most bullshit I have ever heard in one sentence. Mafia III for PC is a console port. The game has so many problems when it comes to reflections, lighting, and no SLI support. The antialiasing just blurs the game to make the edges look better, the PC controls are horrendous, and the game is being upscaled from 720p. It's so damn hard to focus on the story aspect when the screen is tearing, the graphics are glitching out, things pop in at ridiculous distance, but wait, they are releasing a patch to make the game run over 60FPS, and fix the issues. Too late, you already screwed up the game's launch, and what you have done will not be forgotten. They did release the patch to unlock the framerate, but since they never optimized the game good, it still runs like shit. This was my birthday present, and it's the worst fucking birthday present I have ever gotten. Hangar 13 didn't deliver on their promise on putting time, and effort into their PC version. You had 5 fucking years to sort all this shit out, but you didn't. Nice job Hangar 13, you made a sequel to Mafia II worse.  Don't buy this game."
179728001,english,0,360430,"[i]As a first time player.[/i]  Mafia III nails the 1960s vibe with a detailed city and an incredible soundtrack that immerses you in its world. The first few hours are cinematic and gripping, but the excitement quickly fades.  I hate writing reviews without finishing games, but this one is boring af. It doesn’t make you feel like you’re part of the Mafia, instead dragging you into repetitive side quests that block progress to the main story. Cool unlocks, are locked behind tedious grind sessions. And without a fast travel system, getting around the massive city becomes a tedious time sink.  A promising start derailed by frustrating design choices."
182762819,english,0,360430,"Its just rinse and repeat. All the missions are the exact same thing with zero variation. The first few hours were so strong and I bet the story is amazing, but they extended the game 20 too long which is very evident from the idiotic mission design. Its just time wasting. Guess, Ill watch the cutscenes on Youtube as there is no way i'm spending 30 hours or so doing the exact same thing over and over again, Its insane."

148865293,english,0,360430,"A lazy-made game with a few interesting mechanics, but almost everything works with bugs or problems. Optimization, in my opinion, is pretty good, such as graphics.  Positive elements, noted by me:  - ""fatalities"" - lethla\non-lethal, depending on walking\running and weapon in your hands. Looks smooth and brutal. - Some characters are really interesting. - DLC missions are the best ones in the entire game (lol), excluding the prologue. There are more, but they are inconspicuous.  Should say special hate for critical bugs: - Cars' tires can't live longer than 20 seconds in chases. I mean all 4 tires will be broken after 20 seconds of any chase and enemies don't even need to shoot. Can you imagine how it makes impossible any chases? Can't even say how it is ridiculous. - Pedestrians-kamikadze. I think 80% of pedestrians choose the wrong direction to dodge your car and jump right under your tires. Funny? No, because there are cops (see previous bug). And because your car reacts to it inadequately.  Any words about seamless grind are unnecessary. Just avoid it in every possible way (I used cheats). Also, I liked music."

25900160,english,0,360430,"Nevermind the 30 FPS. (Fixed in patch 1.01)  - No saving, only one constantly overwriting checkpoint system. Want to re-play a mission or go for different decision? Well, you better start the game all the way from the start again then. - Contains a ton of incredibly lazy and boring, unskippable cutscenes where Clay talks with one of the minor story characters. All of them shot from exactly same camera angle, which never moves, and neither do the characters. They give no info related to the main story and did I mention they are unskippable. - Hold [DEL] as a default keybind. (Default keybindings have been improved in patch 1.01) - Game fails to detect native screen resolution. Was set 1600 x 900 on my 1920 x 1080 screen. - In-game options can't handle using Steam overlay. Enabling and then disabling Steam overlay while options menu is on closes the option menu, even if you are in middle of making changes. - Rolling menus, yes, you must wait for the menu to roll past Kill list, Assets, Journal tabs to get to Options. - All weapon stats in percentages, including ammo capacity. Freaking love these revolvers with 15% and semi auto pistols with 31% ammo capacity. - Mouse sensitivity settings are a mess. Mouse sensitivity in menus is extremely high, bringing sensitivity down to usable levels in menus brings in-game sensitivity to unusably low. Menu mouse behaviour also suffers from mouse de-acceleration. - The game has a backlighting profile for Logitech RGB keyboards, which only makes things worse. Just three red vertical stripes, does not illuminate keys that are actually bound for gameplay functions. - Lock opening QTE gets repetitive and old really fast. - Looks horrible because everything on screen is softened/blurred so heavily. For example faces at about 20 meter distance are blurred into solid brown blobs. No sharpness anywhere. No combination of graphics settings seems to fix this. - Death and money mechanics. When you die, instead of ""loading last save"" you lose 50% of your money and you continue with whatever ammunition you had when dying. Respawned with 5 ammo on the pistol and 3 on SMG. -> Go buy more ammo before getting back to action. - Camera positions when driving are way too low. There are near, medium and far camera positions, but none of them actually are set high enough to be properly able to see in front of you. This also adds to the bad looking graphics when ground textures are viewed from a flattened angle. - Deadlocked traffic jams that break ""follow that car"" missions. - Badly executed subtitles where long blocks of text are often cut in middle of sentences and the timings are off.   Mafia III manages to implement usability problems I've never even seen before. It is incredible that they have managed to put effort into making things worse from usability point of view.

137642489,english,0,360430,The game is really bad. The district mechanics are very repetitive and thus boring. The game is more reminiscent of a Splinter Cell or Assassins Creed with repetitive tasks. The graphics are not to my taste either. The city is not very original. Everything looks kind of the same and the driving is very arcadey.
70246957,english,1,360430,I really enjoy the game. Have played thru it numerous times. Just started back thru it again.

191119581,english,0,360430,"If there were a ""[b]Neutral[/b]"" option on Steam, I would put this game in that category. Unfortunately, I have to choose between ""[b]Recommended[/b]"" and ""[b]Not Recommended[/b],"" and that's tough because my experience with this game was a mix bag of enjoyment but it also boring me to death.  Mafia 3 is a huge departure from Mafia 1 and 2. Those games had that signature ""Mafia feel"", you were deeply embedded in the mob, experiencing a gripping and linear, story-driven experience that captured the old-school gangster vibe. Mafia 3? Not so much. While you have ties to the mob, you’re not part of it in the same way. Instead, the game shifts gears and leans heavily toward an open-world, GTA-style/Ubisoft formula. This game isn’t inherently bad, but it does cause the game to lose part of what made the Mafia series so unique. The story is really good imo! It’s dark, gritty, and unforgettable! One of the strongest aspects of this game.  Unfortunately, the gameplay is a hufe let down. The missions are painfully repetitive. Taking over districts quickly becomes a chore. You’ll find yourself doing the same types of objectives over and over, and it drags the experience down. Combine that with frequent crashes! I had to restart the game multiple times just to get it running and it can be frustrating.  In the end, [b]Mafia 3 is a good game, but it’s not a good Mafia game[/b]. If you go in expecting something like Mafia 1 or 2, you might be disappointed. But if you give it a chance as its own thing, there’s some enjoyment to be found. Just be prepared for the rough edges."
122590783,english,0,360430,2k Launcher. Hate leaving reviews that don't talk about game but I can no longer play it thanks to launcher. This is my fruitless attempt to give myself some form of relief by punishing them in my small insignificant way.
29925489,english,0,360430,"From pre-release trailers this game looked to be like a more expansive version of the amazing Mafia II, but no.   Pros: +The story, like Mafia II's is very well written. +The facial animations in cutscenes are the only thing the game truly exceeds at.  Cons: -Gameplays is needlessly dull and repetitive. You know UbiSoft towers? That optional ""content"" that was basically padded on to every Ubi open world game from 2012-15? That's this entire game essentially, yet somehow worse. -Speaking of repetitive, you literally go back to the exact same areas and do the exact same things in very short periods of time. -Something about the gunplay feels off and so does the driving. -Even on hard, the enemy AI is useless.  -The lack of content that wasn't there at launch despite being shown in trailers like changeable clothes just highlights how much of an unfinished mess this was. -Despite updates to add new features and slightly improve performance, this game still full of glitches and crashes on a more than capable machine.  -In general, the game looks awful. Its far more bland than the colourful screenshots used in advertisements and the games lighting in infamously abysmal. -Despite the well written story, there is so much padding between key story missions that I'd forget what was happening.    So yeah, this isn't good. Don't buy it. Not even if it's cheap. It's a sub-par bore-fest."
109933836,english,0,360430,"Yet another game where a Mixed review, instead of Recommended/Not Recommended, would be more appropriate.  Where the game shines is its story, cutscenes and voice acting. The first ~2 hours are amazing, with the cutscenes and gameplay elements interwoven to create this incredibly engaging storytelling experience… and then it drops you into the open world, which I will write about a bit later.  The animations within the cutscenes are just incredible. The lip synching, face animations etc. are the best I have seen so far. The textures are incredibly high quality as well. This makes me wish they just focused on the story in a linear fashion like in the previous Mafia games, instead of doing what they ultimately did. Outside of cutscenes the game looks good, though there are some weird looking instances of draw distance behaving erratically, same for glass and mirror reflections.  Story wise it’s engaging, interesting, presented in a pseudo-documentary with interviews with an aged cast of the game. The interview parts are thrown in periodically throughout the duration of the plot, without ever overstaying their welcome, but being frequent enough as not to let the player forget about them.  Main plot missions are fairly original, definitely more appealing than the open world, with some fantastic set pieces. I won’t spoil anything but, again, this proves they should have spent their time on making the game linear.  All of the above constitutes around 20% of the whole game. The remaining 80% is doing open world tasks: 1.	Go to district 2.	Talk with quest giver about taking over an enemy racket 3.	Do $X of damage to the enemy property by stealing money, killing enforcers, or burning assets within the district 4.	Once the $X of damage has been reached, return to the quest giver 5.	Get the mission to kill or recruit the racket owner in a building you most likely have already visited doing the $X of damage part of the mission 6.	Kill or recruit the racket owner Do all of the above 17 more times. Yes, you read that right. Seventeen. 9 districts, 2 rackets for each. No matter how good the combat is, how satisfying, vicious and brutal the takedowns are, how many different approaches you have to some of the tasks, you are essentially doing the same stuff again and again. This literally kills Mafia 3. This is the main reason this game has Mixed reviews here on Steam. I never had any technical issues, but that does not matter, since I have to kill the 25th damn enforcer and burn the 132nd box of assets on my way to kill the 13th racket owner.  Another issue I have is how over the top it is compared to other Mafia games. The protagonist, Lincoln, is a great example of it. Instead of being a regular human being like Tommy or Vito, Lincoln is a Vietnam war veteran seeking vengeance for the deaths of his family, who stands at 6 foot 3 inches and looks like he’s 250 pounds of pure muscle. He is able to run head first into a gun fight, eviscerating enemies with his combat knife left and right. If he gets hurt, he can just jam an adrenaline syringe into his arm and continue his rampage largely unimpeded, unless he encounters guys with shotguns. Lincoln is not a Mafia character, he is literally the Punisher. Why is the Punisher the protagonist of a Mafia game?  The DLCs are on the level of the main plot missions, so they’re good, but each of them is only around 2 hours long. They also are over the top, more like GTA than Mafia.  Ultimately, I cannot recommend it, because if you want to enjoy the story elements, you will require a TON of patience. I know I spent much time on it, but I wanted to know if there is any gameplay variation at any point in the game. There is not."
35854721,english,0,360430,"Not worth the $75.  $20-30 would be more reasonable, although it feels as though the developers were forced to release the game before it was complete.  Being a hardcore fan of the series, especially the second game, I was really expecting something special for the third (and possibly final?) game in the series.   Something about this game reeks of clashes between designers/developers. I feel almost as though there was a group of talented designers and developers with experience working on this game, trying to add quality where they could, but ultimately held back by the poor choices of other designers and developers.  Mafia III runs on an updated version of the engine that powered Mafia II. This feels evident in a subtle way; the dynamics and movement reflect that of the second game in the series.  You play the role of Lincoln Clay, an absolute monster of an ex-soldier who is out for blood at the neck of the most powerful crime boss in the city of New Orleans. Along the way, you build up your own team of lieutenants, complete missions and take over the city region-by-region.  THE GAMEPLAY is good in general, but it is executed and applied poorly. Prior games applied the beautifully crafted experience where you would meet up with fellow gang members and discuss details, work out what your goal was, and then work your way through a set of unique obstacles to each mission such as sneaking into warehouses or following cars to remote locations, sometimes with sabotage from the other team.  In Mafia III, each mission consists of a 'cutscene' in which Lincoln stands in front of some generic random person in the exact same way, and both talk about what you're going to do. Almost every single mission (around 98%) are identical in gameplay, and simply take place at different locations. They usually consist of ""Drive to this gang area, interrogate and/or kill the boss, and trash the place while you're at it. This is the games weakest point, and it becomes repetitive within half an hour of beginning missions as you predict what comes next. The cutscenes are re-used over and over for every single mission, with Lincoln simply standing over an enemy and holding a knife to his throat, then either knocking him out or killing him.  THE ENVIRONMENT of New Orleans is masterfully crafted. I was personally excited to experience the ""French Ward"", based on the French Quarter of New Orleans in reality. Each area is detailed with gorgeous buildings, vivid lights and a whole group of beautifully subtle features that make the world feel 'real'. Walking past houses, you might walk right up to a random front door and hear muffled music inside.  There is one flaw however, there is absolutely nothing to do in New Orleans! You cannot eat at bars, find new clothes, steal from weapons shops, do any kind of interesting activity (bowling, use strip clubs etc).  THE CARS seem to handle pretty much how you'd imagine cars from the 1960s would. Big, boxy designs of the late 60s barrel around corners with horrendous understeering which in itself, actually becomes a fun mechanic; you must navigate your environment carefully.  However, you cannot own your own vehicles in this game like the previous ones. There is no car that is special to you, you must simply steal one, or request a lieutenants man to bring you one of a tiny handful of custom selected cars .  THE WEAPONS have absolutely no guts. Instead of massive revolvers that punch holes in enemies and machine guns that rip things to shreds, each weapon feels like a cap gun shooting bb pellets. The sound design is clear but poorly suited to each weapon, and the gunplay segments are repetitive. Enemies shoot back blindly with no co-ordination or tactics. One thing that did irk me is the inclusion of weapons from the 1980s when the game is allegedly set in 1968.  Something Mafia II did well was allow you a sense of progression in the world. Vito had to work his way up (often for the rug to be yanked back out from under him) and it was apparent through different houses, cars, amounts of money etc. In Mafia III, you actually own no more or less at the end of the game than you do at the start with the exception of territory. There is no acquired sets of clothes, no arsenal of weapons, no garage of cars.  For MAFIA II fans; The game does give a definite, but extremely quick closure to Mafia II, but I would recommend simply searching youtube for 'Mafia III Joe Barbaro' to find out what happened. Vito has changed a fair bit since his time in Empire bay. His way of speaking and his accent are different, now resembling the fast-talking chicago-type gangster rather than the logical Vito once represented in the previous game. He's become extremely aggressive, fast-talking, and seemingly bitter with everything.  + Very authentic New Orleans Environment  + Atmosphere is incredible, can be very beautiful sometimes.  + Incredible Soundtrack  + Interesting lieutenant mechanics, being able to call in favours from others and try to keep everyone happy with owning a piece of the city each is a challenge.  + Driving can actually be quite fun, steering and maneuvering is quite satisfying.  - Story is stretched out and predictable  - Extremely repetitive gameplay  - Poor weaponplay  - Buggy, low framerate from time to time, repeated crashes.  - Inaccurate for the period (ie weapons from the 1980s in a game set in 1968, cars from the 70s in 1968 etc)"

26073749,english,0,360430,"There's not a single good thing that I can say about this game.  The story is supposed to be good but it just isn't! An orphan came back from the war and fights racist criminals who killed his homies. That's it. That their story. I don't know about you, but I didn't expect this lackluster from a Mafia title. And the developers have told the story and shown most of the cutscenes on their YouTube channel anyway. Gameplay is unbelievably repetitive, everything feels the same, like running in circles. Or rather walking very slowly. There's usually just a single animation for each action and it gets very annoying watching it over and over and over and over ... again. Driving cars is not enjoyable in this game and you'll be driving a lot. I was quite disappointed that there's no cockpit view. I mean we've seen it in promo videos how Clay switches the gears and tunes his radio but there's none of that in the game. Also customization options for cars are more limited compared to Mafia II and became available long after the launch. NPCs react unrealistically to hero's actions. I broke into a closed empty club at night and there was just one girl dancing non-stop paying no attention what-so-ever to me until I shot her. Bystanders run straight towards the player to call the police and enemies can't see Clay right in front of them in stealth. Graphics are insultingly bad. Textures are a blurry mess, sky is the worst I've seen in any game. It can turn bright orange in the middle of the night and it changes in such a weird way that you question the state of mind of programmers responsible for that all the time. How did they manage that game looks worse than games from ten years ago is beyond me. Soundtrack which I've already heard in a hundred other Vietnam themed games and movies is great. But it was created half a century ago by people who have nothing to do with Hangar 13. And last but not least. The centerfold girls are the same ones that were in the previous game... It's not that costly to do a new photoshoot of girls in 60s interiors. Overall game feels like a lazy cash grab. I'm very disappointed."

59026047,english,1,360430,"A CRIMINALLY underrated game. I've been playing this game with all the DLC and I gotta say it's has been an amazing experience. I know Mafia 3 is a pretty divisive games amongst fans and regular players, but for me personally? I love it and it's right up my alley.  CONS: 1. Repetitive gameplay loop - Now, I'll clarify this: the gameplay loop never bothered me too much. I loved the combat and driving mechanics, so it never grinded my gears like with other players. I do understand that this can be a breaking point for some folks. 2. BUGS - Now, I played Mafia 3 when all the patches were implemented. Still, I got 2 crashes when finishing a mission and there were some bugs that popped up that really annoyed me. Example: I finished a simple objective in a mission and when a cutscene script was supposed to kick in, I was just standing in place and couldn't move at all. Thankfully, I was able to fix it with ease by loading a checkpoint. Still, stuff like that can be very annoying and can put people out of the experience easily.  PROS: 1. Great story & Excellent Characters - If there is one thing most people can agree on about Mafia 3, it is that the story, writing, and characters are very well done. I actually gave a crap about all the characters and wanted to see where the story was gonna go next. One thing that Mafia 3 does better than most of it's competitors is that it actually has compelling villains with understandable motives - hell, some even have RELATABLE motives. Along with that, the game accomplishes to not absolve them and make them sympathetic. They're still terrible people, but it doesn't mean they're aren't human. Mafia 3's story and characters are definite highlight. 2. Combat - The combat in Mafia 3 is super satisfying. Going in guns blazing or sneaking in like a predator are both options that can be done with no qualms or setbacks. Gun sounds have a satisfying kick and the feedback from enemies in terms of death and injury are very brutal and strong. Headshots have a crispy pop and the general combat mechanics ride a nice line between over-the-top violence and realism. 3. Driving - Now I ain't no NASCAR driver or car expert, but the driving in Mafia 3 is fucking awesome. You really feel the weight of the vehicle you're driving. The sequences where you're chasing someone, or are being chased are butt clenching-ly tense and exciting. The police chases in this game are actually intense! Oh, and the racing is a very neat 4. Mocap and animations - The mocap in Mafia 3 is some of the best I've seen in a while. A definite highlight is Father James, who has one of the most expressive faces in gaming history. When there was actual emotion coming from a character's face, I felt it - down to the individual wrinkles and all. 5. Presentation - Mafia 3's best strength BY FAR is it's interpretation of the 60s during the ending of Vietnam Era and Civil Rights movement. You can feel Vietnam and the racial tensions all over the game. There are moments in the game where key events in that time period are mentioned and even play a small part in the story and gameplay. Hell, the way they tied how the police works with the time period is excellent. If you cause havoc in one of the poorer and predominantly Black districts, police are less likely to respond to your actions. However, if you start shit in the more wealthy districts like Downtown and the French Ward, the police are gonna be on your ass just like that. 6. Soundtrack - The original soundtrack for Mafia 3 has become one of my faves in recent memory, but the real star of the game is the licensed soundtrack. This game makes amazing use of songs like ""Paint it Black"" and ""Just a Little Bit"". It elevates certain scenes and makes them feel ecstatic. 7. DLC - I'm not gonna spoil any of the DLC, but all I'll say is this: BUY THE DELUXE EDITION. The DLC expansions are all great and adds some very much needed variation to the game. It turns the game into a worthy purchase, in my humble opinion.  All in all, I love Mafia 3 and think it's a great sequel to Mafia 2 (Which I also loved). The story, characters, writing, presentation - along with the pretty good combat - sealed the deal for me, personally. However, I do know that it went away with some loved mechanics from previous games and the gameplay loop can be deal-breaker for some players. So what I'll say is that you should definitely wait for this game to be on sale or when it permanently becomes cheap. Buy the deluxe edition to get the full experience with the DLC. Thank you for reading my review."
161384394,english,1,360430,"I couldn't care less about what many people say about this game having repetitive levels or bugs. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this game.  The story depicted a compelling tale of revenge.  The characters were excellently chosen, and the game featured some awesome cars, interesting cutscenes, and a fantastic open world.  The DLCs were good overall, except for one that was bad.  This game had some weaknesses but it was worth my time.  Mafia 1 and 2 might be better, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of this one. 8/10"

132170021,english,0,360430,"It feels harsh to post a negative review after 244 (alleged) hours playing and enjoying it at times. Underneath the janky graphical style is a SOLID ""conquer  the territory"" game that has great missions, good visuals, a well-developed city, a big map, constantly lots to do. Or there would be if the game would just get out of its own way.  Probably the hands-down W.O.R.S.T. port of a console game to PC that I have ever played. Transitions, such as cut-scenes, seem to crash the game pretty regularly, even after all the years of patches.  The map seems open world, but really, it's not. The freedom to face enemies your own way is seriously limited by a top-down 2D design for the tactical map (what you move around in) that says, ""No, you may not climb those rocks to get cover"", ""No, you may not go through some bushes, that's a boundary"", ""No, you may not smash that window and get cover inside that building, use a door like normal people!"" and so on.  It's pretty clear this game was developed to a seriously limited budget. Which is a shame, because the developers had some serious chops, some solid ideas are in it, they've had to cut corners, but they've tried to bring their vision to bear. But, in the end, those limitations lead us to a game that feels very much like Mafia 1 design/graphics/limitations, a game from 2002, in a 2017 game.  So, it's a sad emoji ""No"" vote from me. I think if you can bear with the crap, play it -- I still try to -- but just go in eyes-open: knowing what you're getting yourself into."
28806210,english,0,360430,"PROS: - First 3 hours of gameplay are really great and enjoyable. - America's 60s - New Orleans...ehm..Bordeaux - America's 60s - Soundtrack! - America's 60s - Cars!  CONS: - Pretty much everything else. (Story. Missions. AI. Repetitiveness of game mechanics. You name it.)  Let me be perfectly clear. It's NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game. Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were. You simply can't remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it. Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get. There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities.  Result: Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team  do it properly. Unfortunately, Hangar 13 doesn't seem to have a clue about what original Mafia games really were about. If you really like America's 60s its worth a shot, though."
83163229,english,1,360430,"An amazing story that unfortunately gets dragged down by its tedious, repetitive game design. I truly enjoyed Lincoln as a protagonist, he's a layered character with nice voice acting. The game definitely is not shy to deal with mature subject matter, deals with alot of subjects that might make a few people uncomfortable. The base gameplay is enjoyable but feels off from time to time. definitely not the most refined shooting in an open world game that I've played. Brutal combat takedowns are absolutely enjoyable to pull off. Stealth is bare bones but it works. I do recommend its story, and its solid dlc."

68335044,english,1,360430,"Mafia III (2016) | April 5, 2020 | [★★]  If anything, I think the game is worth checking out for the story alone. It’s unfortunate that the gameplay is so much of a slog that some players may not think the story is worth the trouble. However, if you have the time, the extra coin, and love mob stories, this tale has a satisfying end."
140943024,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 got a bit of a bad rap when it was released, and (at the time of writing) still has 'Mixed' reviews.   This is a little unfair, while the criticisms levelled at the game at launch (buggy, samey combat, poor performance) may be true to some degree, the Definitive edition, with all the extra DLC it brings, means that the game is rarely boring.  Mechanically, the game is much like any other GTA-clone - more open world than Mafia 2 (and much more than the original), but still without an excess of side missions (indeed most combat encounters are either story missions, or in order to unlock the next story mission).  The game has a clearly defined story, but each region of the city must be 'worked' to force the capo of the region to come into the open.  That is typically achieved by finding and disrupting the street level crimes in the racket (the gun runners, the drug dealers etc.) and interrogating low level enforcers until you have forced the head of the racket into the open.  Dispose of both rackets in a region, and the capo is exposed for a mission. The missions themselves are often great, some intelligent set-pieces, and pretty good gun-play.  The grind work however is a little more boring (hence the initial complaints).  All the mechanics are fine, it's just annoying going around the city's whorehouses to gun down pimps, only to be sent back to one of those same whorehouses to dispose of the racket boss.  Fortunately, those locations are great, and no two regions share the same rackets (though there are similarities of course), and the formal game missions are top notch.   The game actually starts with a stand-out mission - a bank robbery gone wrong, which climaxes in a boat race under the city to the thundering theme of 'Born to be wild'.   However, the games first mis-step for me, was at the end of this escape, as we ploughed the boat up and over a ramp the camera pulled away and I roared 'Born to be Wi-i-i-ild'... The game did not however force the climax of the music here (whether by accident or by design).  It's a silly thing, and yet rather than an epic (if cliché) end to the chase, instead the main flow of the song continued and i felt deflated.   The game never again manages to blend the music and stylings so well, and since i heard the song multiple times in the future, maybe it was purely coincidence, but what an opportunity was missed.  The soundtrack overall is great, there's some obvious classics missing, but the period accurate music selection is wide enough, and good enough, that it is highly reminiscent of GTA Vice City before they started dicking around to avoid renewing the licensing - I fear that when Mafia 3 inevitably gets the same treatment, it will steal much of the games charm (but fortunately that is not true yet).  The remaining sound design, particularly voice acting, is excellent, and really sets the tone for the 70's in the deep south of America.  Racism is on display nearly everywhere through the game (though oddly not too much from pedestrians), and is obviously a central tenet of the story and dialogue, but it's played well, enough to make you uncomfortable, and remain sympathetic to the protagonist.  Mafia 3 stands out from others in the genre, by making you give the regions you liberate to allies, who in turn grant bonuses to you - a gunshop, extra health, someone to collect money from you (when you die, you respawn at a safe house but lose half the cash you have in your pocket - so this is a huge perk) etc.   There's also 2 distinct car upgrade routes.   Firstly, for completing side missions for your allies, and secondly at the garage.    The game explains this terribly, but the garage upgrades are purely cosmetic and utterly pointless, while the ones from your allies are worthwhile.  There is a racing series (which i suspect is from a DLC) which this becomes critical for, but these upgrades can also be useful for just generally getting around the city.  The city itself is a wonderful place, a huge bayou area, and then 7 or 8 distinct city areas, each with clear architectural styles, and unique feels.   It's definitely one of the best cities I've seen in an open world game like this, and while it's not so fun to just drive around once you've done the story, it's definitely part of the character of the game itself (and surprisingly memorable to navigate too).  Overall, I do recommend Mafia 3.  While the first game holds a special place in my heart (how many other games have the cops pull you over for doing 35 in a 30...), and I felt more comfortable in the world of the second game, it's a testament to the world building of 3 that while it's not a comfortable world to inhabit, particularly as Lincoln Clay, but that I wanted to see what would happen, both to the city, and to Lincoln. For the other launch criticisms of poor performance and crashes, I had no such issues, the game was routinely locked at my screen refresh of 120fps except for brief moments maybe 2 or 3 times a playsession when the game was buffering in another part of the city.  Perhaps with less RAM, or a slower GPU it might struggle, but I suspect it's been heavily optimised since launch."
76147294,english,0,360430,"[b]Mediocre at best.[/b]   This game was never finished to the fullest. And after re-release of ""Definitive Edition"" experience  got even worse across all platforms. I will get back  to that later.   Game looks amazing and stunning at times. Has great Soundtracks of the late 60s. All tho still not as big as GTA or Saints Row earlier releases. But thats ok.   Combat is pretty good along with the new finishing moves and rechargeable slow-mo ability that you can use on a go. Also you get a bigger choice in arsenal, and not just small arms but big heafty weapons too. Always a big plus in my book, just remember to farm some cash because  they arn't cheap. I guess inflation impacted all. I almost forgot, you can carry only 2 weapons at a time.   Plenty of nice cars to drive and race if you get to that point. However you can't save any random vehicle in ur garage [i]Psst you don't really have one anyway..[/i]    You can only call for the ones you own or unlocked, you select the car from the list and get it delivered to your location just as weapons van or money pick up. Yes there are no weapon shops anymore.   [i]Q: Can I upgrade my cars?..[/i] A: Yes but mostly for the looks, only gear transition makes any changes in performance. Rest has to be either earned or purchased (locked to progress of the story) [i]Q: really?[/i] A: Si.   [b]Districts[/b]  Ahh yes the new implementation to the game that didn't do  anything new. Idea that was pretty good in Saints Row 2 and fun to play in co-op and really bad in The Godfather 2. Here you take away 9 districts (6 if you look for choice) away from Bad Sal Marcanos hands and you call the shots on who gets what district to rule and what benefits you  receive from it all or how much of a cut you get from it... But not to fast you will have to do additional tedious fetch quests if you want to max your earn from EACH! district. OK?! Alrigh.   [b]Story[/b] It exists... Its the rest of the gameplay that dosn't hold the torch to  that story with isn't bad, but has no grip like the old ones.  The best moments are literally when you are after consiglieres. The rest is rinse and repeat Go there and find out what he knows. ok now go there and interrogate this or that guy.. ok ok noww gooo and kill all soldiers till Capo shows up! And you go on like that x 15-16 times. Oh FUN! Worth it!   [b]Now onto the things that made me sad and than mad.[/b]   [b]BUGS[/b] Bugs that prevent you from progressing story, solution? [i]Yes load last checkpoint, no biggy but annoying.[/i]   Random crashes and + achievement stat reset. (You can't view your ingame stats like in previous M2 that would be to much to ask for, so make notes) Game gets to call the shots on that one I'm afraid, and when it dose it resets your stats like: total money earned/spent, how many underbosses you flipped or killed, how many enemies you've killed with specific weapon, melee kills and distance travelled with super car... Awesome! Apparently they use to be fine before the ""Definitive joke"" release, but after it was a different story. I can confirm I have to work around them because  attempting speedrun is somewhat impossible with random  crashes. Be warned! game is unstable.    AI is more of an A than I when it comes to driving.  Doing 120mph on a road (Police dont mind) approaching crossing section, one tw4t! decides to slow down while  you are close by so you have minimal chance to avoid him... EVERY SINGLE TIME! Its like they see you coming and  become brain dead. Because F you man and your nice car.   Ohh and dont even get me started on the laughable ""damage model"" of the cars. none existent. Sounds ok to me.. some say. Yeah well until your hood opens up and you can't close it down like in the previous Mafia 2  [i]I've used the hood view while racing on the busy streets.[/i]        RED ALERT! RED ALERT!! SPOILERS AHEAD!  Hear me out. Ending of the Mafia 1 [spoiler]Story deepens, get immersive  Toma's Angelos wisdom words after being shot like a dog on his front yard. Heart breaking[/spoiler]   Ending of Mafia 2 [spoiler]Simple but still gripping, attaches you to characters Last words after completing final mission. [i]""Sorry kid.. ******* wasn't part of our deal""[/i] Jaw dropping and heart stopping moment.[/spoiler]   Ending of Mafia 3 [spoiler]Little connection to your underbosses Cutscenes says more about your actions, good last confrontation with Sal Marcon (3 ending)  [u]Only one of 'em is cool.[/u] Donovan steal the whole show! xD Aahahahahahah[/spoiler]   [spoiler]Seriously i want to know what the hell is Donovan going to do after his last action. Where is he going to run.... I want to know.[/spoiler]   DLC are alright I guess Well maybe except that last part with renovating  Sammy's place, what a joke.    [b]Summery[/b]   It feels like a new engine demo, with alot of ideas  thrown in together to see what sticks and what dosn't.  I'm all for innovations and risky ideas to change or  improve the experience, that is how we get good games  in the first place. But when the game tries to be different and fails at doing so, Nvm the fact that it has unfixed bugs or that it lacks in attention to detail in some departaments. But when the main attribute of the series (story) fails to make an impact... man something went wrong.   Its hard for me to recommend this guys, especially after  Definitive joke Edition release. And I'm a big fan. I will be honest.. NO! its just boring, no soule   However. 1968 can be best experienced here if your willing to close your eyes on few things here and there. apart from that treat it like a modern mainstream game.  Review note update 25/09/20  Tagging spoilers and sort out my bad grammar along with nonsense I've putted here and there. ^^   Thx for reading."

133873239,english,1,360430,I really enjoy the game. Have played thru it numerous times. Just started back thru it again. I am probably one of the oldest PC gamers still gaming at seventy two years young. If anyone is older I would like to hear about your gaming experience. Have been a gamer since the beginning of gaming...LOL
97967167,english,0,360430,"I have a pretty high tolerance for bad gameplay when the story is good, so I really believed I could finish this game in spite of its flaws. I was wrong. I heard the game is a buggy, repetitive mess with bad mechanics - but the Mafia 1 remake used the same engine and was actually really good, so I figured... how bad can it be? If the story is good (and that's the one thing the reviews seem to agree on), I'll get through it. I was wrong.  What broke me was not the unbelievably high number of bugs and glitches for a AAA game that's been out for 5 years, nor the fact that the graphics are embarassingly bad with the stupidly short draw distances and exaggerated pop-in, terrible lighting effects and just flat out boring visuals (GTA V was released 3 years earlier and looks a hundred times better). It wasn't the wonky gameplay, subpar driving mechanics ( + no fast travel), repetitive missions, god-awful AI, annoying intrusive and unnecessary HUD,  bad UI, or pointless chores like stashing your money after every big mission so you don't lose it when you die. I can live with all of that. It's extremely annoying, but I can handle it.  What broke me is something I didn't actually see other reviews mention at all - The terrible way the story is intergrated into the game: In Mafia 3, you don't get to go do story missions whenever you want to, potentially ignoring all of the repetitive side activities, like you would in other open world games. No. You go around doing repetitive side activities, and after you've done enough, you get rewarded with a little bit of story. The story, while good and carried well by really good voice acting, is basically bait. It's dangled in front of you like a prize to get you to do more crappy boring shit, and just when the tensions are high and you feel it getting interesting... hold it! Gotta grind for another 2 hours, then you'll get to see what happens next.  That's just inexcusable. I stopped when I finally got my gang together, and then unlocked 5 new neighborhoods to go do repetitive shit in before I can get a few more crumbs of story. The game even had the audacity at this point to tell me ""Hey, since this is the Definitive Edition, here's some DLC side content you can do as well!"" I just said to myself - ""Nope, I'm not doing this shit"", closed the game and uninstalled it.  This game is an absolute disaster. Don't buy it, and don't even play it if you got it for free. It's not worth you time."
40016118,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 Pros and Cons  Pros: -Music -Vito Scaletta returns -John Donovan -Fun gunplay  - Actual Story assassinations are fun and new -Explains why you can cut through enemies -Family -Different Endings -Cutscenes are very pretty -Story was alright but different than what you've seen before  Cons: -Lackluster missions -Terrible stealth system -Cars are very weird -Not an actual mafia -Cover mechanics are weird -Weird Issues with lighting - Had to restart missions at some points throughout the game for NPCS getting stuck on random things. - No Joe Barbaro   DLC: The DLC is very different than the main game, it actually offers fun levels leading to the end and you actually feel as if you are accomplishing something. Stones unturned was a very fun DlC and gave me a smile throughout the entire adventure. There is not very much to say about the DLCS  Overall as a fan of the trilogy I enjoyed the game very much, the repetitive missions were not as much of problem to me compared to others, depends on how you feel about grinding. The story was very different to me because Mafia 2 is one of my favourite games of all time and Mafia 3 certainly does not live up to it but it still has a lot to offer to a new-comer or an oldie.  7.5/10"
105752312,english,1,360430,"i didn't understand the hate for this game, but i recently realized the reason why.  mafia 1 and 2 are relatively short (between 10-15 hours), linear stories with little to no pause between chapters, and no great reason to venture beyond the given path. (now for the record, i also adore both 1 and 2 for what they are.)  but mafia 3 deviates away from that. it plops you into a big open world city where you are free to do what you please, when you please. there is little to no direction given for what you ""must"" do or go. added, the story is also about 4x the length of its predecessors.  [b]i sincerely think[/b] the reason this game gets the flak that it does is because those who enjoyed mafia 1 and 2 are people who primarily enjoy the more linear gaming experience. and there is nothing wrong with that! but because of it, mafia 3 can be very overwhelming if you don't know what you're getting into or have your expectations fixed on something closer to the other games.  because there is a LOT to do in mafia 3. and quite honestly, this was the experience i was hoping for all along from a mafia game. i LOVE fighting for rackets, assigning districts, and all of the characters are just excellent. i feel in control and invested, this city is gorgeously designed, and i love a good revenge story. people say the story is ""simple"" but, that sounds so dismissive of what a good story it really is. seriously, does it NEED to be complicated? it's not exactly like the previous two games were particularly complex, but their stories were also great!  as for ""grindy"" and ""repetitive"" gameplay: i only half-agree. primarily, seriously, ya'll gotta get fucking creative! if you're just going in guns blazing with the same loadout for every interaction, yeah, it's gonna get stale. but the game gives you ample options to mix it up. [i]so mix it up![/i]  [b]BUT[/b], as i mentioned above, if you're the type of gamer who only enjoys a more linear experience, i can see this becoming tedious.  but for me? i fucking love it. i haven't been so hyped for a game from story to characters in like over a year.  so to recap/t;ldr: [b]Mafia 3 is NOT a linear gaming experience. It is open world, free choice, and very long (when compared to the other mafia titles). Story and characters are excellent, but if its gaming style not what you are looking for, stick with Mafia 1 and 2.[/b]"
25936825,english,0,360430,"Well, I have been reading through most reviews, positives and negatives and none of them seems to match my fellings about this game, so I decided to write one myself. I'll List pros, cons and neutrals and give my conclusions at the end of the review. Maybe its just luck but I haven't experienced a single CTD and only very few fps drops (After the fps patch they seem to become more common, but still manageable) and one small freeze.  I'll update the review at each new patch or fix released.  Pros: + Catching story and interesting historical setting + Good voice acting and facial animations. + Great atmosphere and city. Makes you feel inside the game and the historical context + AMAZING soundtrack. 60's rock, blues, jazz and country all the way fitting perfectly with the overrall setting. + Interesting characters, rich dialogues and the plot seems consistent so far even if sometimes its feels rushed. + Impressive lightining effects even though there still some bugs and some people that dislike it. + Cinematic narrative. It feels like you are watching a documentary about your character life and impact on New Bordeaux crime scene.  Neutrals: . Driving Mechanic. I personally like it, as it seems like real driving but I guess a lot of people will not think like me. . Somewhat strange animations. (Getting into or out of cover, Lincoln running with a gun and pedestrians animations are particularly weird.) . A not-so-free world. Even though you can just hang around the city without any specific objective there isnt much to do outside the missions and collectables (It seems there will be patches to fix this, wich reinforces my final conclusion) . Racket System gets repetitive too soon. . Cluttered UI. I can go past it, but it's really annoying sometimes. . Textures are not high-ended and polished as one could expect from a 2016 AAA game but it doesn't mean they are ugly!  Cons: - Grainy and often foggy graphics. (The fps patch released on 10/08 adress this, it looks much better now but still an issue) - Step back from Mafia I and II. Shops, bars, clubs are useless even though they are marked on the map, policemen dont care if you are driving 120mph, cargoes dont get damaged etc. These small bits of realism that made the Mafia series unique are absent. - Very restricted field of view (remember GTA 3 and VC? That the map loading was so slow that you could go to someplace before it was even loaded?) (10/09 Update: Fps update adress this as well, it looks reasonable now) - Notable graphic quality drop from cutscenes to actual gameplay.  - FPS lock (30 fps in 2016? Seriously?!) (Even if now there is a patch for that it still a HUGE flaw for a pc game coming out with a 30fps lock) - Bizarre night and day cycle. There's no in-game clock (at least I haven't seem one) and day/night cycles looks totally random for me. - Bizarre control scheme (Why not use GTA scheme?) (I play on a controller btw, things seem shitier for keyboard users) - Very Dumb AI. Enemies and NPC's both. - Overral feeling that you are a playing a BETA and not a finished game. Especially because the next patches will bring things that should already be in the game (as outfit changing, street races, interactive shops etc)  Conclusions:  1) Mafia III is a consistent game with a lot of potencial. Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales. Actually I would give it a 6/10 but it has potencial to hit as high as 9/10 or higher.  2) This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me.  3) DONT PRE-PURCHASE!!! Pre-purchasing ANYTHING is just plain dumb. You are giving away your money in exchange for the promise of a product and NOT for the product itself. This is destructive to any kind of industry as the quality tends to drop as the profitability of that product is already guaranteed before the product even exists. And in my humble opinion this is exactly what happened with Mafia III. A game that was released rushedly and unfinished, with no concern to customer satisfaction as a healthy profit was already safe and sound way before the release date."
40153590,english,1,360430,"[u] M3[/u]  So; like most people, before buying this game I was kinda turned away from it from hearing about it's mixed reception.  I came in optimistic and I played it non-stop for an entire week.  So yeah, I really like this game. Speaking as a fan of the entire trilogy.  The first main game-tweak I noticed that made the game more fun to play compared to [b]M1 & M2[/b], was the open-world approach of; do anything, whenever you want. -- Both [b]M1 & M2[/b] have story missions that are often driving from one edge of the map to another for entire chapters. But the way this game handles 'city district takedowns' with 10+ objectives to go to in the zone, where you only need to clear 5-6 to progress in the story.  Also, the racket-takedown / infiltration parts are not nearly as shallow or repetitive as its reputation would have you believe. You get new weapons and tools, and there are numerous strategies to test and experiment with each time.  -- In addition to the many twists the game throws on that aspect during the mid-to-late game.  Looking at the statistics on, say, achievements, apparently between 1/5 or 1/4 people actually reached the ending of the game. Perhaps this is part in how those critizisms were overblown?  And on the big subject of the game's setting change from [b]M1 & M2[/b]: it's still a crime drama like the rest of the series.  With the characters I'll say, as a huge Mafia II fan and an MGS fan; Lincoln to Vito is the Raiden to Solid Snake. -- That's not a bad thing.  Also on the setting, the game-feel is different and more modernized, this also confused many fans. My best response to this is to take a qoute from [b]YouTuber ChuggaConroy[/b], when he played trough [b]Super Mario Sunshine[/b] and commented on how different it was to all other main-series games in that:   [h1]""I wouldn't say it's unpolished, it's just a different kind of polish""[/h1]   If you're an optimist, you'll most likely enjoy it.  -- Just remember to spend some time in the in-game settings before diving in, the 'kinda dark default lighting', the keyboard controls for movement, combat and driving.   I urge you not to be turned of by the reputation, there's a really good game under its rocky start."
28173471,english,0,360430,"As much as I wanted to like it, I simply cant. The starting story (the first 20 ish minutes of the game was the best parts, and for 15 of those minutes it's a cutescene and for the other 5 you're in a bank). The story dies off and is followed up by repetitive gameplay doing the same thing over and over again but with different looking enemies.  Step 1: Deal damage.  Step 2: Kill officers. Step 3: Kill distict bosses. Step 4: Make higher ups angry and then kill them (also they spawn in the same place, not even a new area).  Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 about 6 or more times and then call it a game.  Also it's great when the vehicles and ai glitch making it lag and having explosions everywhere. The ai of this game invented drifing 100% All in all not worth $60 in the slightest. More around $30 ish. Just play dishonered 1 or 2. They are much better."

I know that today, Mafia 3 is pretty heavily criticised and has a pretty bad reputation overall.  After beating the game all over again, I can say I do recommend it, but just barely and with a huge warning attached. I won't lie to you, this should have been the best Mafia ever made, its lost potential is found in every damn part of it. After playing it I can conclude that I suspect this game was a victim of rushed/rocky development. For every amazing or high quality aspect, there are some mind boggling omissions. Of course, we will never truly know what happened whilst this game was being made. All we have is the final product.  The story tries a lot of things. While I love the idea behind it all, it feels unfortunately rushed and improperly thought out just like many other elements of the game. You follow Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam War veteran and coloured man living in the fictional New Bordeaux in Southern America in the late 60's. Without spoiling anything, the game is an overarching revenge plot as Lincoln leads a war against the Italian Mob after they take everything away from him. The actual revenge plot is pretty compelling overall. The introduction is quite lengthy and definitely helps you learn many of the characters, making it hit even harder when everything comes crashing down. The game does a great job of making you absolutely hate these enemy characters. The main issue revolves around the theme of racism and the main villain himself. To discuss the themes, racism is extremely prominent in this game. Due to the time period and location presented, I expected racism to be pretty prominent. However, I don't think I am alone when I say this game is incredibly self indulgent in it. You will hear the n word probably almost a hundred times before the game is over. Initially its uncomfortable, but after you hear it a hundred times you become numb to it. Its pretty obvious that the story has undertones of coloured revenge on white people, seeing as you are a coloured man taking down an entire empire consisting of almost entirely racist white people. This isn't an issue on its own, it is however very transparent in pointing towards an agenda when it didn't need to be. The people you face in this game are already horrible people, you don't need to remind that they're racist every five seconds to motivate me to take them out. As for the villain, he is just plain hollow. He is kinda just a piece of shit and nothing else. His personality is that he is a racist, greedy psychopath and that's about it.  On a technical level, this game is a huge mixed bag. Characters can look extremely detailed, but on the other hand some side characters look like they were pulled from a ps2 sports game crowd. The weather effects look downright bad and the sky-boxes look atrocious for a modern game. Some buildings look highly detailed whilst others are flat and bland. The vehicles look really good across the board, however the damage modelling is basic and unimpressive. Some animations are highly polished, whilst others like the molotov throw look hilarious in comparison. I could go on and on, but all you have to do is watch some gameplay for yourself. Its crazy hard to get immersed when the visuals are pulling you in so many different directions.  Thankfully, the game is pretty great in the sound department. Most of the voice actors do a pretty good job overall. General sounds are of a quality standard and the guns sound punchy. The music in this game is also incredible. Its an awesome selection of classics from the 60's era and made driving around far more interesting with the awesome tracks blasting behind me. My only complaint in the music department, is as you switch vehicles you will hear tracks repeating quite often and there is a very tiny selection of radio stations in game.  Being totally honest, Mafia 3 has one of the most oddly designed gameplay loops I have ever experienced. The gameplay on its own summarises why I feel this game was rushed. This also represents where the majority of complaints towards the game originated from. The idea is simple, there are 9 districts total, each containing two rackets you must take over. You follow a simple formula. You do a bunch of small objectives until you do so much damage to a racket, you eliminate the person running it and then you rinse and repeat. Once you have taken the two rackets in a district, you take out the main head of the district, dole it out to one of your under bosses and then you do it all over again for every single other district. The game feels good to play, but the mission variety is seriously lacking. The melee is kinda piss poor, but the shooting mechanics themselves are great. You spend the majority of the game just taking out district after district with very few proper story missions spread throughout. As everyone else has already said, it is a literal grind and a lengthy one at that. You take districts, dole them out, kill more lieutenants and do it over and over.  Here is the warning, if you do not enjoy Mafia 3's raw gameplay, then there is nothing for you here, run the hell away. If the shooting and raw mechanics weren't so satisfying for me, I would not have pushed through, hell no. The driving controls crazy good and the shooting is very satisfying, especially with the late game weapons. However, the objects are repetitive as hell and do not improve over the course of the game.  I know it sounds like i'm ripping the game to pieces, but overall I'm just mixed as hell. The raw mechanics are fun, but the objectives are basic and uninspired. The game is visually inconsistent, but the cutscenes look incredible. The setting is well depicted and the music is awesome. There is a lot to love, and a lot to despise about Mafia 3.  The game was fairly stable for the most part. The game does find it pretty hard to maintain a stable 60 frames regardless of settings, however the game never dropped below the 40's on high settings so it wasn't a huge issue. The only really bad bugs I experienced had to do with alt-tabbing. Everytime without fail, if I alt-tabbed the game it would erase the sfx audio, cause severe stuttering and the cutscenes would freeze. It is important to note that many of the bugs I experienced in Mafia Definitive Edition are present in this game also, which is pretty garbage.  The game took me around 17 hours to beat, so it is quite lengthy, but a lot of that is a district grind that not everyone is going to find tolerable. If you can get the game cheap, I would recommend giving it a try. Its not a bad game, but its got a ton of flaws riding against it. I recommend it just barely, but with a lot of warnings attached. Its a shame, because this could have been something far better."

Overall i guess if youre a big fan of the first two mafia games, and Mafia III is on a pretty nice offer, go for it. I think im a bit more than halfway through the game and i gotta say, the more i play the more disappointed i get.

121165154,english,1,360430,"I don't know why I got so hooked on this one. It is by all means a mediocre open world game - not even close to the excellency of RDR2. But something stange happend (I'd experienced it with DAYS GONE too): I kept on playing and having fun. I liked the writing, I liked the protagonist. It was refreshing playing an african-american hero and he managed to be both likeable, earnest and a total badass. I thought the world-building was well done too: The city looked like a real, geographical place, not a jumble of motifs and the team managed to design some beautiful set-pieces for the main missions: While abandoned theme parks and insane asylums don't sound very original in the context of a videogame, here, they were realized with such an attention to detail that I really enjoyed exploring.  Speaking of the missions: These are hit and miss. Most of the main missions that don't involve your criminal day-to-day activities are great, like [spoiler] your fight against a demonic new-age cult or the hunt for a lost sowiet warhead [/spoiler], but the rest is VERY repetitive, lacks variety and can occasionaly get tedious. It never pur me off playing though, maybe because the developers pulled of some great driving physics and gunplay. I truly enjoyed the shootouts and I liked how they allowed you to seamlessly combine stealth and violence. Overall the gameplay mechanics worked really well for me - save for the bugs of which there still are quite a few. Fortunately, none are game-breaking, most aren't even that annoying.  Story-wise, I'd say, I'm kinda 80% satisfied. Haden Blackman, the man who wrote Mafia III, also writes comic books which I felt was both a gift and a curse, since most of the characters were deftly written and felt solid enough for video game characters, but they did sometimes veer into Whedon-esque quips which I disliked. The dialogues with the CIA agent were particularly annoying. There were occasionaly points where I felt the writing was somewhat construed in order to move the plot along but it wasn't too bad. If RDR2 is the prime example of how to write interesting dialogues and make your characters archetypical instead of stereotypical, then Mafia III was a solid effort with some obvious shortcomings. At least they managed to nail late 60s in southern USA (at least as far as I can tell): Some of the radio commentary where bigots complain about the government's fair housing act because they fear their neighborhoods becoming open to black folks were hard to listen to because they sounded so realistic and were excellently voiced, just like the rest of the game by the way. There's not one weak performance.  So that's the stuff I liked. The criticisms brought up by others are all valid. Mafia III is repetitive, it lacks variety. It didn't feel dull to me, though, and I'd recommend you give it a try if you can get it on sale."
51071109,english,0,360430,"Let's start this review off by saying I played Mafia 2 many years ago and I absolutely loved it. Till this day it's one of my favourite games of all time.  When I heard that Mafia 3 was coming out, I was over the moon and I pre-ordered it which in the end was a big mistake. The game looked promising at first and it had a chance of being something great but it wasn't. Immediately after Mafia 3 was released, I played it non stop for 7 hours and after that I never touched it again. It was dull, repetitive, unpolished and I was utterly disappointed.  Today, after 3 years I decided to give it another chance. I really wanted to like this game but after a couple hours in I remembered exactly why I stopped playing. The missions are repetitive and you will be doing the same shit over and over again in each district. There, of course, are some good things too. The combat system is brutal, the music is awesome and the story seems okay so far but unfortunately I can't bring myself to play this game any longer when there are so many amazing games out there. It's unfortunate this game is not what I hoped it would be."
184974002,english,1,360430,"I got to buy myself a copy of this game with all the stigma of it not being a ""good"" mafia game. First of all, I must agree it is not really a Mafia game. Whilst playing you realise quite quickly that in reality is about putting end to the whole mafia mentality and getting revenge for those who were lost. Those new allies who were found in the process stood by your side. It was never meant for you to be a part of Mafia, but to build something a little better in the wicked world of ours. Story was great I really enjoyed it. Characters had good screen time ( mainly the allies ). Sadly without much development excluding, Clay, Donovan, Father James, Vito and Sal. Others were good too but for me did not have that much impact on the whole world/story of the game. DLCs were great I enjoyed them all. The first one with witch hunt was amazing story, that gave more time for Lincoln to develop, The second one with Roxy, was more fun but had a great background and I really enjoyed working with The Voice ( voice acted by a my guy Lee from TWD The Game Series :3 ). The third one with donovan was quick but action packed shit show, that was enjoyable too. Gameplay was most of the time very good. Some game mechanics polished over time, but there is still some bugs that can influence your opinion on the game. Its the nitt picky stuff, I enjoyed the game as is.  And to those the game was boring and too long of the same I strongly disagree. Mainly beating small racket bosses and then killing Sals lieutenants. Yeah it had its moments, but I still enjoyed killing every single KKK member, getting rid of the greedy fucks that were ruining the lives of many people. A literal ONE MAN ARMY!!  I can say I did all the SQ too, and it made the game whole. Just one thing is missing from this game. FAST TRAVEL MAN. The driving mainly for SQ was sometimes BORING :D.  8.5/10. Good job Hangar 13. Love from Slovakia."

This story is about Lincoln Clay, a US Army veteran deployed during the Vietnam War as part of an elite unit. Back from the conflict, his involvement with the mafia families soon backfires: a deal gone wrong is all it takes to set Lincoln on a quest for revenge.

From the cars, dresses and mannerisms of people - everything just blends together very well in a consistent manner. A lot of the buildings of this very large city are even explorable, which is something the previous Mafia chapters didn't have. The devs also made a bold move in depicting racism and discrimination with an uncensored form.  [b]2.[/b] Shootouts and fights are daily routine in a city plagued by gang wars and power struggles. Lincoln, on his bloody path, will face hundreds of enemies - so the combat better be damn good, and it indeed is. Weapon hits on foes have a good weight, for instance it's not rare to see enemies fly away after being hit by a shotgun, or contorting on the ground mortally wounded, before expiring. This realism does extend also to melee and takedown moves, which are quite a show too. Most weapon classes indeed play out and feel diverse, each with a specific style.  [b]3.[/b] The soundtrack encompassing and eventually emphasizing critical story events is well picked. Radio stations constantly broadcast a stream of iconic hits from the times, along with news and other chatter. Solid.  [h3]Cons[/h3] [b]1.[/b] By far, the biggest issue of Mafia III is the extreme tediousness of its tasks. Be it main missions, side activities or secondary quests, the majority of them falls into a very narrow set of archetypes that becomes stale very quickly. ""Go there, kill everyone, interrogate someone / steal something, go back to base."" Rinse and repeat for the whole game, i'm not even exaggerating one bit. There are some exceptions to this, but they're few and far in-between, way too far.  [b]2.[/b] Hundreds upon hundreds of collectible bits are scattered throughout the city, ranging from CDs to components and other stuff. They are often tedious to get, serve no purpose exception made for Components, and become a constant drag composed of ""get out of your car, get the shiny bit, go back into the car"", this for hundreds and hundreds of time on end. That's not all: main missions force players to first clear certain sets of side activities that always follow the same archetypes, thus further bloating the content.  [b]3.[/b] On paper, Mafia III has a lot of tools, upgrades and weapons to unlock at the Vendor and through raising the influence of Lincoln's associates. However, this progression never feels like it makes any major change: newly acquired weapons or upgrades (which involve significant grind) are never game changers as they feel marginally better at best, so the base combat / driving / exploring feel will not be changed much, nor the variety of approaches expanded by these upgrades.  [b]4.[/b] Enemy AI is dumb as bricks. Seriously. They will mindlessly expose themselves and try to snipe Lincoln with a pistol from miles away, while the protagonist uses a sniper rifle, for example. Enemies will often be oblivious or have very slow reaction times to Lincoln in stealth, which proves overpowered most of the time. This on the highest difficulty even.   [b]5.[/b] Graphics quality is very inconsistent even in this ""Definitive"" version. Some textures or models will be low quality, while others definitely up to par, seemingly without reasons. Draw distance will literally make cars or even buildings appear from thin air at random no matter the settings, while lighting effects have weird afterglows and ""trails"" in many situations, which is immersion breaking. In addition optimization is trash, with random FPS drops at times on a high-end machine.  [h1]Gameplay Breakdown[/h1]  [b]Exploration[/b] Is performed either on foot or by vehicle, there is no fast travel so everything has to be reached manually. New Bordeaux is a massive city littered with hundreds of collectibles, that have to be revealed by Wiretapping junction boxes (shown on the global map), provided Lincoln has enough Components to do so, which are scattered around. There is no worthwhile exploration to do apart from seeking and using Wiretaps to reveal everything in a map chunk, then repeat the process over and over.  [b]Combat[/b] Plays out in third-person shooter fashion, with the protagonist being able to carry two weapons at a time, belonging to different categories such as Shotguns, Pistols and so on. Most weapons either have to be found or unlocked at a trader for hefty sums, same goes for gadgets such as grenades or other contraptions. Stealth is a valid approach to most situations as well, being Lincoln a trained veteran, which can take down any enemy in melee combat - silently. Vehicle combat is also a thing, with the ability of shooting and throwing explosives from most cars, useful during chases.  [b]Management[/b] Consists in progressively conquering parts of the city, subtracting resources such as drug traffics from the mafia families and taking them under Lincoln's control. Several associates will progressively be unlocked for story reasons, each will manage the activities the protagonist assigns them, in turn unlocking specific rewards from a unique list each of them has. Many side missions needs to be completed to fully fortify an Underboss' position and unlock everything they have to offer as reward.  [b]Quests[/b] Are divided into Main, Secondary and Tasks. Usually the main ones progress the story, while others fortify the position of an Underboss or give Lincoln personal gains such as money or other rewards. They are unlocked on the global map as the mains story proceeds.

34240370,english,0,360430,"**Pros**  -Beautifully rendered city environment -Great soundtrack -Offers a variety of tactical choices in combat  **Cons**  -Shooting gallery AI -Dull and repetitive missions -Weak plot  Mafia III is like a selfish lover - it starts fast, climaxes early, and then rolls over and goes to sleep. After starting by throwing you into the action and quickly progressing to the game's dramatic turning point, it never gives you any compelling reasons to keep playing. Lincoln's quest for revenge after his betrayal is boring, implausible, and mind-numbingly repetitive.  The missions have little to no variety: kill, coerce, and destroy, in unchallenging and uncreative ways. There's no emotional urgency or tactical challenge to any of the laundry list of tasks that Lincoln is obligated to complete in order to advance the plot. They feel like delaying tactics to avoid progressing directly to the game's final showdown, instead of elements of a tightly woven narrative.  That's really a shame, because the game has a lot of promising elements that could have been made into an extremely compelling story. The atmosphere of social and racial tension that forms the backdrop of the game is portrayed in a pretty nuanced and thoughtful way (Dixie Mafia and voodoo dolls aside). People on the street freely share their opinions of the social and cultural upheavals of the late 60s, and their observations are generally authentic to the period. The talk radio programs also do a good job of exploring the polarization that existed during the period. And the sights and sounds of New Bordeaux are truly immersive. There are beachgoers, Mardi Gras revelers, heroin addicts, and a whole array of small touches that makes it feel as if you're truly moving through an inhabited city. Unfortunately, the story line fails to do its setting justice.  If Lincoln had been forced to conceal his identity and gather information on his own, slowly revealing the elements of the conspiracy that led to his betrayal, the game's narrative tension would've been much higher and the missions would've been more satisfying. Instead, the game introduces an old CIA buddy who's just completely out of place and irritatingly cartoonish. His sole purpose is to chain smoke and give out information that advances the plot through exposition instead of action. He may as well have been named MacGuffin. The only contribution his presence makes to the game is unearned information, deathly boring cutscenes of congressional testimony, bad acting, and goofy wiretap sidequests. It's an idea that should've been cut out the game entirely.  -GAME MECHANICS-  On normal settings, the AI will occasionally try to flush you out and flank you, but for the most part enemies will generously comply with staying in one spot and repeatedly sticking out their heads for you to blow off. Enemies will also offer themselves up like lambs to the slaughter when Lincoln ambushes from cover, repeatedly walking into the same trap despite the five foot high pile of bodies in front of it. Lincoln also has the ability to pick up and move bodies out of sight, in order to remain undetected. The cover mechanic is a bit wonky, making it difficult to move quickly from cover to cover, or to pick the intended cover in the first place, but given the AIs general incompetence, it's not that much of an issue. The ambush from cover mechanic is one of the more satisfying tools in the game, but as I mentioned earlier, it can be exploited because the AI will never avoid sending waves of enemies to the same ambush spot.  Despite the array of tools that Lincoln can be outfitted with, from molotov cocktails to proximity mines, combat overall is pitifully generic and unchallenging. The wide variety of heights, interiors, objects and landscapes that the game renders so meticulously are never fully exploited. Every encounter is a shooting gallery.  Shooting, driving, running and climbing all work pretty well. Bullet time is available, but the action was never intense enough that I even thought about using it. There's also a so-called ""intel view"" that gives you x-ray vision, and makes no logical sense.  -GRAPHICS-  New Bordeaux is beautifully rendered, with a wide variety of landscapes and neighborhoods on a sprawling game map. Many have complained about the game's poor optimization, but it runs well and looks stunning on my rig. YMMV.  -FINAL THOUGHTS-  Despite its lofty aspirations and beautifully-rendered setting, Mafia III's story and gameplay just never finds its footing, and it winds up lost in the bayou swamps. 5/10  System Specs: Win 10 64 bit | EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB GPU | Core i5 7600K @ 3.8 GHz CPU | ASRock Z270 Pro4 mobo | Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3200 16 GB RAM | PNY CS2030 480 GB NVMe SSD | WD Blue 7200 RPM 1TB HDD"
118606968,english,1,360430,"I know I might be a bit late, because the game came out around mid 2020, but I just had to make this review...  I don't even know where to start.  I'll start off by saying that this game is, for me, at least, the best Mafia game out of the three. With: a really big, open world, a lot of fun optional chapters, three FREE DLC stories that are really fun, and quite long, and an AMAZING story. This makes the game the best one out of the three.  Of course, as much as the game is amazing, it is not perfect. It does have bugs, some repetitive quests, but, that is quite small compared to everything else! I've spent a little over 74 hours on the game, and those were well spent hours. The bugs do not happen too often, but, they sometimes force you to load to your last checkpoint, which takes only about 10 seconds to do.  The story is... a masterpiece. Now... I know that some missions are repetitive, but the story as one of its kind, is amazing. A lot of heartbreaking, twisted, fun, hyper, sad, emotional, etc... moments, make the story a solid 10/10.  The optional chapters are also indeed very fun and interesting! They're not necessary, of course, hence why they're called ""optional"" chapters, but, they really build up a story for certain characters! Believe it or not, if you want to know the real story of some characters, you MUST finish the optional chapters. Optional chapters gave me even more amazing experience, and I would have hated myself if I did not finish them.  Story aside, let me talk about the graphics, physics, guns, cars, voice actors, soundtrack, etc...  The graphics are really good! It really gave a ""cherry on the top"" vibe, because it really is so beautiful. Not too great, not too bad. Right where the sweet spot is! A PC with average components will be able to run the game on max settings at 1080p with no problems!  The physics are also good! Sure, there are a few bugs here and there (e.g. if you turn on Aim Assist, at some points, it'll be more unhelpful, than helpful, but that's not always the case! Also, Aim Assist is recommended if you're playing with a controller, because the general sensitivity for a controller is kinda too fast for some certain guns.) Other than that, the physics are how they should be! Really well done, if you look over those small bugs.  There is a wide selection of guns. I personally loved using a simple pistol! I've felt most comfortable with it. My secondary weapon was an AK-47. Definitely helped me through all the ""Kill 'Em All"" moments, in which, a lot of enemies spawned. As I've stated, if you're using a controller, some guns may be a little harder to use than they should, but, Aim Assist should fix that (partly!)  I am not a guy that's into cars that much, but, this game made it so fun for me to just spend time driving around the map. My favourite type of cars was the Exotic section. Especially the fast, red one at the very bottom! They're very easy to control, and the modification for the cars is also great! (Note: To unlock all the modifications, and cars, you must complete optional quests, hint hint ;))  Each and every character had an amazing voice actor! The accent, the voice, the tone, it all suited amazingly for every single character! My personal character, and voice actor from the game, was Donovan! He is a complete savage, a really funny guy, and also very based!   Oh how I loved the soundtrack in the game. Excluding the radio, the music in cutscenes, certain chapters, etc... It was really amazing! Each and every soundtrack fit the chapter you were going through, so it really pumps up the hype when you're doing your thing!   Also another very big plus that I'd love to mention is the NPCs (enemies). They're indeed very realistic! (e.g. if you shoot somewhere, alert the enemies, move without being seen, the enemies will go past you to look at the location where you've fired shots from! This is a really great detail, and I don't think that a lot of games do this. Most games just send the enemies to where you currently are, even if you were not spotted. It also helps with taking down enemies faster!   Thank you for sticking with me in this review! I was really happy to write it, because, this game is indeed very special to me. Thank you 2K Games for making this masterpiece."
48337899,english,1,360430,"[h1] Is Mafia 3 a good continuation of the Mafia game series?	[/h1]  I started playing Mafia 3 right after my first playthroughs of Mafia and Mafia 2. I didn't have high expectations because I heard bad things about the game from some of my friends who played the game before. They were disappointed. They are big fans of Mafia games but they didn't like the last game at all. I spent 77 hours in the game finishing every single main and side mission and in my opinion it's a great game. It's just not a very good Mafia game as we know them from before.   Mafia 3 is different. I would compare it more to Watch Dogs or Watch Dogs 2. You no longer have a linear story. You have a huge open world and you have so much freedom in there - couple of main and side missions you can choose from and also you can start playing all 3 DLCs before you finish the game because they are part of the open world as well.  [h1] Story [/h1]  The main protagonist in Mafia 3 is a black man called Lincoln Clay. I can't say I felt much for him. He seems to be a very calm and emotionless person. He is a cool and tough guy, but that didn't make it easier for me to really care for him. He is like an empty shell.  Lincoln's story is a story of revenge. In my opinion the main plot is quite interesting and exciting. It might not seem like it at first, because there are many fillers in between the story parts. I always enjoyed those special final missions of each district which moved the story forward. Sometimes you get to know a bit about what's going to happen before it even happens because parts of the story are video tapes from the future where certain people talk about big and scandalous happenings in the city.  My most favourite character in the game was probably John Donovan, ex C.I.A. agent and close friend of Lincoln. Donovan became his trusted source supplying him with intelligence and advanced government technology. Donovan is a funny guy. Everytime there was a cutscene where Lincoln and Donovan met, Donovan made me laugh so much. He is cool, charismatic and self-confident.   Good news! There are some characters from Mafia 2 in the game so you can definitely look forward to seeing them again. They are the connection to Mafia series. Without them it would feel even less like a third Mafia game in the series.  [h1] DLCs [/h1]  The DLCs in Mafia 3 are simply amazing! I think that they should be part of the main game, but they are not, so please be sure to buy them as well if you decide to buy the game.  The main game can get a bit repetitive sometimes with all the open world activities so DLCs are a great way to add some variety. You should not wait until you finish the game to play them. You should play them before whenever you feel like you need something different. The stories are very special and the developers made some nice environments for it.  DLCs will unlock new equipments for you to use even in the main game afterwards and the ""Faster, baby!"" DLC will help you to earn some extra money which you might need for weapons or upgrades especially early in the game when your income is not that great.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  Your goal is to take over disctricts in the game. There are 9 of them and each district contains two rackets (criminal operations). Each racket will give you several objectives - kill, steal, destroy, interrogate, tail a vehicle. For example it could be an auto theft racket or a prostitution racket. But the gameplay is the same in all those rackets. When you take over both rackets in the disctrict you will unlock the main mission which will move the story forward and which has more special objectives and environments.  Once you take over a racket you can increase its earns to max by doing a very boring mission - delivering a truck with some supplies. I did not like those missions at all. The trucks are so slow and usually very far away.  Other boring missions were the loyalty missions for your underbosses. You want them to be loyal to you to get the best outcome for the game ending but their loyalty missions are so boring and repetitive and there are 6 of them for each of your underbosses. 6 of the same boring missions... 3 times! I wish the loyalty missions were at least as good as the Mafia 3 DLCs. They could have had a deep story. It could have been done so much better! So much potential there considering that one of your underbosses is someone from Mafia 2! Aaaargh :(  There is racing in the game but I haven't tried it apart from one DLC race. My game was often freezing while driving so that would be no fun racing with those fps issues. And there didn't seem to be a benefit for me to do it anyway. I could unlock a new car and some car upgrades, but I didn't feel the need for it. I already had all I needed for my crazy driving style ;)   Jokes aside, the driving in Mafia 3 felt pretty good. All controls were very responsive. I experienced the terrible driving in Watch Dogs so I was very pleased that it was not like that in Mafia 3. I like that the police in this game doesn't try to stop you for breaking the rules. You really have to kill someone with your car in front of them to make them care. And you can listen to the amazing soundtracks of the late 60s era while driving! They are so great!  [h1] Weapons and equipment  [/h1]  There were too many guns in the game for my taste. I could only carry two at the same time so I didn't get to try many of them. I usually just picked those with silencers and used them all the time. There is also so much equipment you can carry - proximity mines, grenades,  molotovs, screaming zemis, c4s, sniper supports and throwing knives.  Most of the time I was trying to do stealth takedowns and not alert all enemies if possible. I was playing the game on the hardest difficulty which makes you dead in a second or two without a cover. And enemies are smart sometimes, they know when you are reloading and they try to rush to your place where you are hiding and kill you before you finish your reload. Healing is possible by using adrenaline shots and your health doesn't regenerate without those healing items (at least not on hard difficulty).  I've never learned to use brutal takedowns, I always found it too risky to fight a person using fists when all the enemies around have guns and can kill me in a second. The tutorial says that enemies will be in shock after you perform a brutal takedown on one of them, but I never got the timing right and I died quickly so I stopped trying. Honestly there are so many ways how you can easily kill your enemies so why to bother with some quick time event brutal takedowns???  [h1] Glitches [/h1]  Mafia 3 is full of glitches. Many times mission NPCs would not talk to me if I entered the room and pressed E to talk to them right away. I would just have to reload my last checkpoint and try again. Then it worked.  I completely lost my main missions after finishing the Stones Unturned DLC. It was such a scary moment. I almost lost 70 hours of my playthrough and I would definitely not start over... I tried to reload the checkpoint to fix it and the game just kept loading forever. I got even more scared. So I restarted the game completely and it was back. Ufffff! They should have fixed things like that.  I decided to share one of the glitches with you here in the Steam review. I was healing myself in this clip at the same time I somehow died so I became a zombie and the enemies couldn't take me down but I couldn't move or shoot. --->[h1]  [url=https://clips.twitch.tv/AlluringGiftedFriseeGingerPower] Mafia 3 ""The Man of Steel"" glitch - Twitch Clip [/url]  [/h1]  [h1] Final Verdict [/h1]  Mafia 3 is not a perfect game. But everyone who loves open world games like Watch Dogs, Sleeping Dogs or even GTA games will love this one as well. If you are a fan of the first two Mafia games and you are not afraid to experience something a bit different, go for it. I think that you will not be disappointed!"
78391840,english,1,360430,"Seems this game's two main criticisms were the repetetive gameplay and bugs.  Well, I didn't encounter any gamebreaking bugs so far and maybe one or two smaller ones in my 11hrs of gameplay.  Repetition... I can understand it for the main story. I'm not too far in, but there are some recurring gameplay elements. Thing is, the gameplay itself is quite fun, so it hasn't bothered me yet.  My only other complaint would be the save checkpoints which are sometimes a bit too harsh.  So with that out of the way: here's what I think of the game.  It's goddamn great.  The story, characters, voice and motion acting are tremendous.  Especially the DLC that's included in this version, are amazing.  You can start playing once you're a bit into the story, but the stories and atmosphere are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. Plus, these missions are more linear like the old Mafia games.  In my opinion, this game is a hidden gem. Hidden because of the bad reviews it probably rightfully deserved when it launched, but now this is truly a diamond of a game.  Against all my expectations, this may be my favorite Mafia game yet.  Let's see if it remains so once I finish it, but so far so good."
107343023,english,0,360430,"The game is essentially the same mission in different locations over and over and over again. For an open world game, nothing is fleshed out and there really isn't anything to do but drive around."
69893871,english,0,360430,"all the bugs, glitches, graphical issues and overall poor quality muddy visuals from the original are in this 'Definitive edition'. it's baffling that a re-released 'remastered definitive edition' of a game can contain every single problem from the original release and introduce some new ones along with it. how embarrassing."
30935101,english,0,360430,"Ok, I need to preface this by stating the following:  1.) I was born in the early '80s. 2.) My parents were Yankees. 3.) I'm whiter than cottage cheese.  To that end I have no real idea if the racism in this game is accurate or a caricature, honestly. I suspect it's somewhere in the middle.  I both enjoyed and was frustrated by this game. It's not really a clear thumbs-up thumbs-down vote. A lot of people will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. There's a lot to do, a lot to see, and a lot to collect. However, those of us, myself included, who want a fleshed out story will be a bit lacking. The game does a lot well, but it has some glaring problems that are, frankly, unforgivable.  Here's the positives first:  1.) The soundtrack is killer. I got the game at a deep discount and the soundtrack alone is well worth what I paid for. It has a great combination of '60s rock, R&B, and pop hits (amongst others). It's a lot of fun to outrun police to the tune of ""Palisades Park"" by Freddy Cannon or have a shootout in a quarry to the tune of ""Folsom Prison Blues"" by Johnny Cash. The developers knew how to use music effectively and did it very well.  2.) The map is quite large. This is somewhat a positive AND a negative as it takes a while to get anywhere. However, the ""GPS"" system works quite well and it's very easy to get around with the help of the minimap. This leads to...  3.) The UI is (generally) well designed. When driving you have a rear view mirror and can easily spin the camera around to see what's going on behind you. The speedometer and tacometer are unobtrusive, if a bit useless. The minimap is great. While on foot, it's easy to see how much ammo you are carrying and your health/armor levels. I also never had any signifigant issues with using something I didn't intend to. The game makes it very clear what item it is you are going to do an action to. There are minor issues when two objects are placed too close to each other, but those are typically insignificant. The game also utilizes several different hotkeys to do different things, so you are never in any real danger of picking up a dead body instead of a dropped weapon.  4.) The vehicles generally behaved realistically. As someone who has driven several vehicles from the mid to late 1960s, I can confirm that they are generally just as sluggish and heavy as they are in the game. In fact, I would say the vehicles in the game perform better than their real-life counterparts.  5.) I personally enjoyed the way the game handled the full cutscenes. The jumps in time were handled well and I really liked watching them. They told the story from a Discovery channel esque ""real crime"" drama taking place in the 2010s. It was unique and I liked the idea.  Now we get to the cons. Some of these are excusable and could potentially have been fixed by patches. Some are inherent flaws in the game that cannot be fixed.  1.) The graphics are generally poor and unoptimized. I tend to ignore graphics so long as they don't royally suck. These are not great. You can tell this is a poorly done console port. This could potentially be excused if the gameplay was good, but that leads us to...  2.) The gameplay (after the first act) is dull and repetitious. The first act is done well. It hops around in time (like the cutscenes) and is scriped well. It's generally fun. Afterward, though, is a repetitious wreck. Basically, you shoot badguys and cause general havok in a specific area until the miniboss shows up. You kill him, do the shooting and havoking a second time until the second miniboss shows up. Kill him too. Then the district boss shows up. The boss levels are usually reasonably entertaining and it's clear THIS was where the real polish was done. Unfortunately you have to do this NINE TIMES. It's dull after the first few and the game doesn't really give you any good reason to want to do it again as all the districts are basically the same bunch of minigames with different settings. Even THIS would be excusable (somewhat) if the following wasn't true:  3.) The AI sucks chocolate salty balls. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst I've ever seen, but that's usually reserved for games that are broken. The AI does exactly what it's supposed to. Unfortunately, the AI is very very stupid. Case in point: run up to enemy location, hide around the wall from a bad guy, and whistle. It doesn't matter if you are on a construction site with a lot of civilian AI that's noisy as hell or a shack in the middle of the bayou; ONE SINGLE enemy will investigate. If you have two talking only ONE will investigate. If you run up to a group of five only ONE will investigate. They will ALWAYS investigate. Again, it doesn't matter where you are or if a whistle could conceivibly be a commonly heard sound. The AI will ALWAYS wander toward the sound like a sorority girl investigating a dark basement. They stroll toward you and practically BEG you to kill them. Rinse and repeat until someone finally sees you long enough for some arbitrary flag to fire and you are in unending combat.  4.) The police exist to do nothing but kill the PC. This is an extention of the prior but it needs an entry on its own. The police do not fight crime in New Bordeaux. They do not protect the innocent. They exist ONLY to kill a SINGLE PERSON: Lincoln Clay. If you get into a shootout with ANYONE and they respond, they will zero in on the PC like a AMRAAM. It doesn't matter who you're fighting or how many civilians are getting killed by the enemy's molotovs: if YOU are fighting they will try to kill YOU. There's also no system of justice either: shoot a civilian, get shot; shoot a car, get shot; shoot a mobster, get shot; break into a store, get shot; break into a telephone exchange, get shot; run over a pedestrian, get shot; lighly rearend a police car, get shot; walk too close to a cop, get shot. On the other hand, burning through a red light at 115 MPH, they don't bat an eye. Mafia I, which was released in 2002, had a VASTLY more sophisticated system of law and order. Let me repeat that: Mafia I, which is currently a FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD game, actually had a system where you had to follow the traffic laws and the cops wouldn't gun you down for a fender-bender. They also suffer from the ""GTA V effect"" and materialize from juuuust out of view and swarm you.  5.) After you finish off a ward, there's not really anything to do there. I can't fault Mafia III exclusively as this is generally a problem with open world games in general, but once you take over a ward there's not much point in ever setting foot there. It's interesting to see the businesses change when they change hands, but once you collect all the Playboys and Vargas drawings, there's not much reason to go back. This leads us to...  6.) The collectables are a tad-bit silly and really really pointless. I like vintage playboys and Vargas illustrations as much as the next man. However, this is because I am, in fact, a man. Enough said. However, this illustrates a further issue:  7.) There's not any particular ""advancement"" in the game. As far as I can tell, you are given all the clothing at the beginning of the game. This was rather disappointing to me as I hoped to unlock additional cosmetic features as I went along. This was not the case so I switched between looking like Laurence Fishburne in ""Apocalypse Now"" to Laurence Fishburne playing Malcom X to an extra from ""Shaft."" In addition, you have a large variety of weapons, that are pretty much ALL available at the beginning of the game, and are all pretty dull. The Colt 1911 was pretty much the same as the Browning 9mm which was pretty much the same as the Colt Python.  In conclusion (since I'm running low on space) the game is not really worth it IMO unless you enjoy doing the same thing over and over to really good music."
29524762,english,0,360430,"I loved Mafia 1 and Mafia 2... the gameplay in Mafia 3 was very lackluster. The game has been transformed to be a wannabe GTA, so if it's going to go there, it delivers poorly. It scratches the surface of gameplay elements we enjoy in similar-looking games like GTA, but with little freedom of choice and poor variety. I love the story idea but story alone is not enough to keep me playing until the end unless it really engages you with lead character development like in former Mafia titles. It's the same problem I have with recent Assassin's Creed games, although the AC games deliver tons of content but still manages to feel repetitive due to the side-quest nature of everything."
80666006,english,0,360430,"The story and characters are pretty good but once you've played the game for about an hour you've seen all it has to offer. Boring, repetitive and uninspired gameplay. You pick up fuses, wiretap a fuse box, maybe kill two targets and then take over a racket. That's the whole game."
45697992,english,1,360430,"[h1]Mafia lll[/h1]  Mafia lll has been a bit of a bumpy journey for me, good and bad, with mixed feelings. However, I feel the need to overall give this game a positive rating. I will go through the basics [i]without spoilers[/i] of the positive and negatives about this game.  [h1]Storyline/Cutscenes[/h1]  The setting takes places in a New Orleans fantasy during the Vietnam times, as you take place of a man named Lincoln Clay, who has returned from the war, and things turn nasty rather quickly. However, that's up to you to find out what happens.  The setting in this game is rather different than the other titles, this game does not much involved you much in the Mafia, however, you do deal with them still, just not like how it was like in the past.  The Cutscenes are good and bad at the same time. Some are just awesome, even with a gunfight with a sequence song playing in the background. However, some are just simple dialogue, where Lincoln stands still awkward, which is one of the drawbacks in the game because it's all the same when it happens. I'll get more into this at the end of my review.  Overall, the story is very good and engaging for me to continue playing the game. Each step of a territory taken with the people you are working with was one step closer to the climax. There will be a lot of gunfights, whether on foot and by car with police on your tail. The average time for me to finish the Campaign would have to be 20 hours, I did milk a lot with other side objectives and the DLC stories with my total of 40 hours.  [h1]Performance and Graphics[/h1]  Graphics are alright, but they do look like they aren't rendered correctly, and just look awful. I'm not picky with graphics, I mandatory Gameplay and Storylines more, especially for this type of game. However, sometimes the game does look damn beautiful, especially at night time. Textures would look weird, and the game just stutters bad, I MEAN BAD. IT EVEN RAINS WHEN ITS SUNNY OUT, CLEAR SKIES, IT TRIGGERS ME!   My system isn't the best, however, some people have been having issues, even with a system far better than mine. If you want a reference, I'm running High Settings with an FX 8320 and an RX 480 8GB with 16GB DDR3 average of 40-60, sometimes dipping lower with that terrible stuttering. Mafia lll is known to stutter a lot. I also had more massive stuttering occurs with a TV as a monitor when I got the game, however, it improved when I got a monitor. Again, it could be my system, however, the game has a lot of reports of lack of optimization, even on console.  Overall, if you can defeat the stutterings of eliminating it or dealing with it, you'll be fine.  [h1]The Progression and Side Activies[/h1]  Mafia lll is very, very, very repetitive, that was the one huge drawback I had about this game. It took me a long time to finish, however, taking breakers here and there, I was able to finish it eventually.   Basically here's how Mafia lll is in a nutshell:  > You go raid a place, shoot it up, steal money or break objects, interrogate this dude and repeat. > Or Chase this guy, kill him, and walk away.  You'll have certain targets to take down, which will be locked, you need to complete little strongholds or ""Operations"" in order to flush out the main person you need to take out. Again, repetitive.  Once you take down the Boss's or all Operations in a certain area or ""District"", you can choose who owns that, not going to spoil who, however.  After gaining more income, racking more to a certain District, you earn upgrades, such as guns, perks to help you such as reduce recoil, and health upgrades. You also get Hitman to assist you while in combat if needed. Cell phone jammers and car deliver, which vehicles also can be unlocked for an instant delivery. Yes, you can also upgrade your vehicles, however, nothing detailed, even less detailed than the last Mafia titles. However, I expect this honestly, I'm not too disappointed.  [U]Other Activies[/U]  You have other Activities, which include:  - Weed Operations (DLC Required: Faster Baby) - Hitman Jobs - Street Racing - Collectables such as Playboy's again - And a few more not mentioned...  Overall, the game does keep you occupied for a while, even without DLC, but Mafia lll is a game where it's all ""Fetch Quest"", which is again a huge drawback to me, and quite a few others.  [h1]My Final Summary[/h1]  [u]Simplified Pro's and Cons:[/u]  The Pros: - A very good story that was engaging to me. - A very good era, cars, location, music, it's all perfect. - Decent amount of activities - DLC's are decent as well if you have a chance to pick them up. - Awesome takedowns, I have to admit they never get old to do. - Alligators that eat you - Lincoln Clay a bad A$$ mother trucker  The Cons: - Repetitive asf - Optimization and Graphical issues - Some bugs happening where it requires a re-loading - Recycled Animations, such as Interrogations - Rather lacking the ""Mafia"" part. - ""Fetch based"" missions  Overall, the game is decent, not the worst, the game is rough. The story is good, the time/era and everything about it is awesome to me, I'm sure some may agree where I'm coming from. If you're able to by-pass the issues and actually play the game for the story and tolerate, completing the repetitive missions, I personally would say it's worth it. The DLC's aren't bad either to try, they will add more gameplay and new explorable locations and new characters to meet, but those will be separate reviews.  Is it the best Mafia game? No, not in my opinion, however, it's still good and exceptional. Well, is this worth Full Price? No, I honestly would highly recommend $15 at least, even better you can snag it with DLC at that price. When the game launched on its first good sale, I got the game and it's DLC for only $17!  Either way, Lincoln Clay has been fun to play as through my journey playing Mafia lll, even though it took my awhile to complete the story, I feel satisfied on the ending, and meeting some old friends."
50100294,english,0,360430,"When this game first came out, all I kept reading was how buggy it was. I chose not to get it, which was a shame because I was such a fan of the Mafia series to date, but I am not the type of person who can spend launch prices on a game and overlook bugs. So, instead, I waited. For a long, long... long... time. And I hate to say everyone, it was not in any way worth the wait.  I wanted to like this game. The characters all seemed really intriguing right from the start, and I was liking the environment a lot. But it took less than four hours of game-play to realize if I wasn't stuck in a repetitive task it was solely because the game had decided to thrust me into another unbearably long cut-scene, often right in the middle of combat. A few hours later, I found myself hitting an unskippable cut-scene, getting up, making my way downstairs, making a cup of tea, putting on the TV, and getting lost in a show entirely forgetting I was even playing this game only to come back to find my character standing there like a fool.  I need to be fair in this review and say I haven't finished it yet. But the reality is, I don't want to. I have no desire to boot it up anymore, I have no interest in launching into the game to drive to a location, whistle a few times, stealth kill everyone without any challenge, and then wait 25 minutes while the game tries to teach me a lesson about how messed up the US government used to be. It's just.. so...... boring."
94254649,english,1,360430,"This game gets hated on for it's repetitiveness, and rightfully so... But the game has a charm I can't quite figure out."
191556987,english,0,360430,"The current top review kinda says it all. This game should be in a neutral category. I usually keep refraining from writing reviews, but had to do it.   Although the setting is awesome and the racial tension is suspense, the gameplay and gameworld are lackluster. I like side missions, however you always have to drive through the ENTIRE map do complete them in Mafia 3. Which is not a problem in a game like GTA but here... To drive 5-10min in a barren landscape with heavy pop-in is just so.. boring.  The story starts off violently good. You get a reason, you get a narrative etc. But after two hours it just repeats itself. Drive to District A, kill everyone and capture the District. Drive to B, do the same all over again.  I don't leave games unplayed. Today I did."
77743457,english,0,360430,Bad optimization... the game got even worse after update to Definitive Edition
139797223,english,1,360430,Despite the fact that this game isnt popular with MAFIA fans (they hate this part actually) I pretty much enjoyed this part  1.One of the best soundtracks 2.1970's magnificant atmosphere 3.Face mimics and nice cutscenes  i would say its a OK Game  7.5/10
188164700,english,1,360430,"I enjoyed this game back in the days after its release and Im enjoying it even more now. Here is why. Previous two Mafia games were heavily story driven since you had one story mission after another. This one is closer to the classic ""GTA"" open world formula with many side missions to do (if you want).  I don't mind when games get repetitive if the gameplay itself is fun. And boy Im having fun with this one! The action, animations and ragdoll physics are so much fun that after finishing one firefight I can't wait to start another. One of my most favourite things are melee finishers. Simply get close to your enemy and press Q key and Lincoln  will perform a finisher depending on which weapon you are carrying. It was the exact same way (even the Q key) in 2005 Punisher game. You can also try stealthy approach or later in the game you can just call in a hitman squad and enjoy the firefight from afar. The choice is yours.  Story is actually very good and especially the acting. You just don't see a cutscene after every finished mission like in the previous games. Story narrative reminds me mostly of Guy Ritchie's gangster movies with little bit of Martin Scorsese mixed into it but at some points you also feel like being in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood since it takes place in the same time period and even contains  some songs that were later used in that movie.  Which brings me to the soundtrack - it's simply amazing. What can I say, one classic song after another. You will not want to turn off the radio station!  What about our main character Lincoln Clay? Im so happy that once more we can have some ""walking tank"" type of character. He is basically like Jack Reacher mixed with the Punisher. For a person like me who grew up on Arnold Schwarzenegger movies it's just another plus. And like a mentioned before the fighting and everything around it is just so much fun. Some people say that the open world is empty and there's not much to do except the side missions. To be fair it wasn't much different in previous games. Map basically served only to get from point A to point B to complete the story mission. In this you actually have things to do, which gives you more money, make things easier for you (like if you eliminate enemy enforcers they won't be bothering you later in the game) and your decisions even have influence on the story since there are several different ways how you can progress. Like in all previous instalments here as well was environment created with great attention to detail that makes you want to just walk around and breathe in the atmosphere. What makes the environment feel alive are the npcs. They have many different dialogs and even reacting on what's happening in the story as the game progress.  At one point after Sammy's bar gets repaired you can stop by to have a drink there which is a nice touch since I always liked to be able to immerse myself into the game doing all those little unnecessary things like being able to eat or drink and stuff like that. There is also one nice little detail some of us appreciate and which is usually overlooked in most pc games and that's the walking button. You can just switch between walk and run.  In case of technical issues - Im only having one. Which is that sometimes when you start the game it for some reason crashes back to desktop after the opening logos. Little annoying but all I have to do is just to start the game again and all over sudden it works just fine. I heard that switching the compatibility to Windows 7 solves the problem but I didn't bother to test it. Other than that game works just fine on max details. Not a single crash during the gameplay. My pc is almost as old as the game, which is Ryzen 5 1600, 16gb ram and GeForce 1060 (and Windows 10). Game can look gorgeous at times but I suggest turning off the depth of field and motion blur to make it look less blurry.  So If you like this genre I really think that you should give it a try. Im not afraid to say that this game is very underrated. It is on 75% sale very often and for that price you really can't go wrong.  You can pray on the way up! - Lincoln Clay  Update: I completely forgot that later in the game you can grow weed and even make your own strains! 10/10!"
187472933,english,0,360430,"The beginning was probably the best part of the game, it had story, action, deep moments and character development. Then AFTER the prolouge you go shoot a guy, rob a place and maybe even blow up a warehouse, sounds fun right? Now do that for every single god damn boss in the game :) There is also many bugs, light issues, crashes and even talking to a guy to start a mission won't work"
25915563,english,0,360430,"TL/DR: save yourself some time and money if you're new to the mafia franchise and buy mafia 2.  *UPDATED* for those interested review follows:  ♥♥♥♥ textures (muddy,grainy, blurry with some SERIOUSLY low res roads walls and general environment) that look like they were ripped straight out of Prototype (a game from 2008 WTF 2K?),   story is basically shadow of mordor set in new orleans (Same premise same gameplay BUT NOW WITH GUNS AND CARS! Boss mechanics and story points are basically ripped sraight from Shadow of Mordor along with the whole story being near identical... but being set in 1960's america) standard revenge storyline low stress,   I've noticed a whole lot of people commenting on the story of the game and how ""brave"" the developers were to take on a troubled era in American history (rampant racism being the main trouble) and while I might not have been alive in the 1960's (I'm 20) i do feel compelled to comment on the use of racism in this game: It appears that the use of racism is purely there as fluff to distract from the fact that the character interaction is really non-existent and very poorly written (probably in an attempt to make you feel something that the character fail to evoke) with completely forgettable characters being thrust forward and never actually developed or fleshed out. You can read more about them in the in game bio screens but from a pure storytelling perspective they are basically flat hollow mission givers with no real reason to care about them or Lincoln's straight Shadow of Mordor campaign or even Lincoln himself! I personally couldn't tell you a damn thing about any of the characters I met during my 5/6 hours with the game and that's a real shame.  rinse and repeat missions (There's so ♥♥♥♥ING MANY of these they got boring and repetitive extremely quickly), often recycling the same layouts and environments for different ""missions"" even enemy placements have very little variation,  crap controls (mouse acceleration with no off switch? c'mon guys that's just lazy/no working key rebind system? ♥♥♥♥ sake),   *FIXED* 30FPS lock out of the box (I know its been said like a million times but it matters),   HOWEVER this now presents the issue pertaining to maintaining a consistent 60fps this game running on my system on high reaches 40fps with the fps locked to 60 NOW i would like to take the time to outline the system that this game is running on:  Intel Core i7 5960X @ 4.5 Ghz 16 GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum at 2400 Mhz 2 EVGA GTX 980 ti's 6GB in SLI (the system req's call for a single 290X or 780 from 2013...) Samsung 850 Evo Pro 1TB All sitting on a ASUS Rampage V Extreme All custom watercooled  this system should eat this game up and spit it the ♥♥♥♥ out 3 times over ESPECIALLY as it runs Witcher 3 on ultra at a solid 60FPS without breaking a sweat, this brings the issue up of just poor optimisation for the PC platform and explains why they didn't put full 60 on from the start. PC was an afterthought, a cliff note, a ""oh ♥♥♥♥ we forgot do that"" moment and thats not right we bought the game same as everyone else treat us with at least a little ♥♥♥♥ing respect you did willfully take our money.   no SLI support,   menu's are a joke, blurry aliased text (if you play at a res higher than 1080p) CLEARLY designed for controllers not a mouse and keyboard (as in it has no mouse input at all apart from in maybe the new game section but still displays the cursor),  if you want to play in 21:9 good luck dealing with all the artifacting that comes with it (lighting bugs, discolouration, interface designs e.g the low health blood that appears only covers a 16:9 space...) including a rave party at the edges of the screen whenever you go indoors (spoiler alert you might have to do that quite a bit),   texture pop in is a MAJOR issue with this game along with a HIDEOUS draw distance that means things get properly rendered when they're 10 ft away (by rendered i of course mean that the textures just pop into existence extremely noticeably)   enemies take 1/2 to a full mag to kill if not shot in the head and even then its not a sure thing (the ♥♥♥♥ am I fighting luke cage? I was playing the game on medium btw mother ♥♥♥♥ers take 7 shots in the chest and keep walking)  the police system that was in mafia 2 has been stripped down to cops shoot on sight if you run a red light (what happened to the fine/arrest/shoot/wanted system?)  cover system works well if not a little temperamental on occasion  shooting felt fine but i found myself constantly running out of ammo due to the aforementioned Luke Cage esque enemies  sneak felt like beating up on quadriplegic kids because the AI is legit totally incapable of seeing you crouched in front of them  driving is either PEDAL TO THE METAL or FULL STOP there is no in between and you'll spend most of your time wrestling for control of the car (the game then has the cheek to offer you ""simulation driving"" to make is harder... what were they thinking...)  the standard formula of go here kill this was a common theme... wait ... the only theme that ran though this game and the story only gave context (sometimes it's really paper thin) as to why you are doing what your doing  the game also has these kind-of not cutscenes but cutscenes where you and the person you're meeting with stand awkwardly and wooden with dialogue playing overtop it (this happens WAY more than it should) normally preceeding you going to a place and shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of it like 90% of the other missions that Clay will be undertaking  lastly the options menu is a disaster the graphics settings seem to do nothing to the look of the game having swapped from high to low and low to high the only real difference I could see was the ambient occlusion was missing on the low preset but texture difference is basically non existant (Im starting to think that low and high are the same thing in the config file)  huge disappointment was a game that i was really looking forward to... :(  UPDATE: Steam won't refund me my money so i guess it's only fair that IF (< big if) any of this ♥♥♥♥ gets fixed i will update this review accordingly"

25900757,english,0,360430,"This game isnt exactly a game of the year in my opinion, but ill make a list below of positives and negatives. Remember, these are only my opinions.  [h1]Positive[/h1] [list]     [*]Story seems quite interesting     [*]Gunplay is really fun     [*]Map seems okay     [*]I really like the trash talk of AI     [*]Some animations are really good, almost amazing.     [*]Being able to drive up with a pink beetle, murder enemy enforcer then driving away with pink beetle while they are shootin at you. [/list]  [h1]Negative[/h1] [list]     [*]Driving feels like you are driving on ice and all cars feel like supercars     [*]I really hate games nowdays that make the game challenging by making enemies bullet sponges.  Once I shot one guy 4 times in the upperbody and he didnt die...     [*]Lack of customization. Remember when you could buy clothing in Mafia II? Or customize your car? Well not anymore. You can upgrade your car's performance and thats about it.     [*]Icons floating and showing where weapons, cash and every other collectible things are.     [*] It is really easy. Havent died once yet.. When you are close to dying just run behind cover or pump some adrenaline into you and you are good to go.     [*]Car damage models are horrible.     [*]Cars sound like beefed vacuumcleaners.     [*]Lincoln having that stupid superpower that is plaguing every game nowdays. Seeing trough walls and enemies glowing bright red.      [*]Lincoln doesnt have any animations or ragdoll when he is hit by a car. If a car hits you, you will slide with the car untill you slide off front of the car. [/list] Overall it feels too arcady for me. Only thing that I play it for now is the story. The game itself spoils a lot of the story but I want to see what happens.  I will play it but wont enjoy it as much as Mafia II"
77013818,english,0,360430,"There is not a single reason to call this game ""Mafia"". There are no families, loyalty, fancy clothes, cars or betrayal. There is no proper story, and the game is very repetitive. You go some place, kill everyone, deal damage and kill the boss, thats all. The open world is so dead, AI is very stupid, both the henchman and normal people driving around the city. Car mechanics are very bad, there is no car damage at all. Graphics are bad, blurry. To be honest, this game has the best licenced I've heard for a while, its like they spent all the money for the music, instead of developing the game."

Pros: - Characters, interesting and with deep backstories - Sound is excellent - Location has so much to offer - Open world without loading screens - Interesting gameplay mechanics - Inspired by the blaxploitation movies for sure  Cons: - Boring AF - Bugs everywhere - It's not a MAFIA story, it's just a ""generic revenge story"" with mobs - territories and mafia wars are a simple copy-paste from The Godfather 2 game - You can't collect cars, or houses or clothes but the game wants you to become the richest gangster in the USA - 'whistle', ""who's there?"", kill the guy in stealth mode, go on with other 5000 henchmen  It's not a full no no, it's a ""meh, what a wasted opportunity"""
64130379,english,0,360430,"The first 2 hours in this game is amazing, it feels like it could win the GOTY title because of its masterful storytelling and character shaping, I enjoyed it very much and felt like I was watching a nice movie.  But the game got the mixed reviews for a reason. It quickly becomes repetitive after you're allowed to free roam in the city. Literally every mission you do is to go to a spot to kill & interrogate certain targets and then receive further information and go to the next spot doing the exact same thing until you finally liberate all the districts for your 3 underbosses which is pretty much everything this game has to offer, it really feels like a chore to do and many people hate it because of that.   But the game starts to get a little bit more interesting again after I liberated the first 3 districts. At least now there are races I can do and I get to modify my cars, it's fun because the driving (and the shooting) in this game feels pretty good. But srsly I dunno what they were thinking, the races are not available at first, you have to grind through the first 10+ hours of the game in order to be able to race. I believe the majority of the players just quit before they even know there are races in the game.  Overall I think this game could've been so much better, the demo back in 2015 looks so good that it's hard not to be sold on the game, I dunno what happened later that could make the game so different from what it looked like in the demo, maybe the lack of money? It's such a shame."

Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales.  This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me."
26251295,english,0,360430,"horrible fucking game, a system of ""go kill this dude, ta da!"" in a storyline that boils down to a ""one man army takes over da mafia woo!!!!!""  nothing to do with the original 2 mafia games (which are MUCH better, don't think they're as bad as this), nor the same charm, gameplay, or anything good about them.

It had an actual story, interesting characters, it was even funny at times, and I couldn't understand why the rating was so low. But then the prologue ended, and shit hit the ceiling. You suddenly have to do the exact same thing over and over again. Go there, kill this guy, move over there, kill this guy... over and over and over and over and over again. It's like the definition of insanity, and it's a pity, because the prologue was really promising. Still, the game has its moments (if you can survive the repetitive boredom), great characters and voice acting, and an awesome soundtrack (though even that starts to piss you off after a couple of hours listening to the same song). I'd rather not say anything about the graphics."

It's so sad to see a Mafia game end up a disappointment like this since this game had a lot of potential and could've been so much more. I would not recommend this game at full price, it's a joke to pay 60 bucks for such a repetitive and boring gameplay that will keep you entertained for 2-3 hours at the most.

83600002,english,0,360430,"Mafia III: Definitive Edition is an action-adventure open-world game. You are Lincoln Clay, a former criminal and Vietnam veteran. You are forced to return to a life of crime to help your family settle problems with the local Mafia family. It does not take long and the Mafia betray and murder your family, so you are going on a quest for revenge. Over time Lincoln is slowly building a criminal empire.  On its release Mafia III was full of bugs, over time it was patched and was good in terms of performance but then came the Definitve Edition upgrade... Now the game is riddled with graphical bugs, sound bugs (ALT+TAB removed the sounds for me), cut scenes are sometimes not working, some characters which should have opened a door for me to proceed stucked and I had to reload the checkpoint, and the performance overall is worse compared to the former version. The graphics are good. The music is also good and fits to the time, however there could be more songs in the radio (you can listen to radio channels, like in GTA). The characters and the story are uninteresting from my point of view. It does not feel like playing in the Mafia world. The game (especially in the later part) is pretty boring and annoying. The missions are totally repetetive (interrogate a person, destroy that and that and kill a special guy...repeat). So, I actually wished that the game was shorter, as it was a torture to do the same stuff again and again. Mafia III: Definitive Edition is a disapointment. I recommend Mafia II or GTA series, but this game is not worth 29,99 € at all.

149999173,english,0,360430,"A Funny Story   The place named New Bordeaux in the game is Saint Denis in Red Dead Redemption 2, and this is one of the reasons why RDR2 was postponed. The name of the city in the game was originally going to be New Bordeaux, but they changed it to Saint Denis.  Because the name of this city name was already used in Mafia 3 and since Rockstar did not want to use this name, they decided to completely change the name of the city.  Some of the new additions are nice, but overdoing it and straying from the main path of the series must have killed the game, and also the optimization is still a disgrace.  But unfortunately, since there are some small good details, I can never praise such a game because this game is completely a hideout cleaning simulator and it makes you repeat the same thing over and over, it is literally a disgrace and very boring."
55049510,english,1,360430,"I really enjoyed Mafia 3, and this is coming from someone that has also played Mafia 2. There seems to be a lot of criticism towards this game, which is a shame because it's honestly not terrible. The gameplay is repetitive, sure. Plenty of features appear under-cooked and the world could've used some more activities. But these things really didn't bother me - for everything Mafia 3 does wrong, it makes up for it with a stellar soundtrack, vibrant setting, good characters and overall decent storytelling. It's not on Mafia 2 levels by any means, but it isn't nearly as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. I thought Lincoln was a fine protagonist, he suits the ""revenge story"" avenger-role well - and has some of the most memorable appearances in cutscenes.  Speaking of cutscenes, they're beautifully directed and could almost stand on their own as a short film series of sorts. Each set-piece is brutal and memorable. The documentary bits with Father James were great, as were Lincoln's meetings with Donovan. Plenty of cinematic symbolism and great camera angles interspursed with historical imagery. Sure, they're pre-rendered CGI, but I still loved them regardless. M3's motion capture is excellent too, adding to the emotional impact in cutscenes.  If you're going to get this game for one reason, get it for the side content, which is where M3 is at its best I think. It has an original score, which is excellent, and a varied radio selection with plenty of iconic artists from the period ranging from blues, soul, country, and psychedelic/garage rock. I also really enjoyed the collectibles, they evoke Mafia 3's setting well and are fun to read through. The inclusion of character bios was also appreciated; the amount of written content in M3 is honestly immense. Smaller content like the handwritten notes you'd find in racket hideouts also really added to the atmosphere. Lincoln's journal gives you a further insight into his experiences throughout the plot.  Speaking of rackets, I actually really enjoyed this mechanic. As you progress through the story and take over districts, it actually feels like you're tearing away at a rival criminal enterprise and are taking over from the inside. The racket missions are nothing to write home about, but still provide a way to make extra money after the main story. Each safehouse is detailed and distinctive, and populated with NPCs, providing a place to bunker down if you're being pursued by the police and supplying you with extra adrenaline shots and body armor. Cash also serves a purpose in gameplay, and you'll want to store it in your safe as soon as possible. If you die without depositing your cash, you will lose some of it. This ensures you aren't careless with your supplies and gives a sense of urgency. It's best to deposit all of your cash before tackling some of the more difficult enemy safehouses.  I also thought the ""marker"" and services system was great because it means you have a reason to complete side missions for each underboss and remain loyal. You'll want to complete these early in the game and save up your service markers, because you will certainly be needing them - like the ability to halt police pursuits, hijack the phone lines so witnesses can't call for the police, and call for hitmen to aid you in combat. Each racket has a clear and defined difficulty curve as you progress through the story - I never once had to adjust the difficulty setting, which I've had to deal with in plenty of other games with ""artificial"" rises in difficulty where it starts to feel cheap. This was never an issue for me in M3.  [h1]TL;DR - Recommended,[/h1] get this game (perhaps on a sale though). I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it, despite its flaws."
25930497,english,1,360430,"Game is 30fps, yes but one of the smoothest 30fps i've experienced in a PC game. The open world is as basic as it gets, but who is here for the open world aspect really? The combat is the games best feature and its pretty satisfying compare to other open world game. The gunplay is already better than your GTAV gunplay. Theres complaints about the enemies A.I, which ive experienced some dumb moments. Enemies all reacting the same and make the same bad decisions, even breaking aggressive approaches in combat while in a gun fight, to go into stealth A.I animation with my character right in front of clear view.   Honestly the game feels like a early access game. I found out that the devs will be adding the option to change characters clothes after the game launch? sign of a rushed game? I've so far small glitches. The graphics are hit and miss, but its decent.   The story is top-notch.   As much as i want my 60fps, i can't deny that this game isnt fully playable. i've had similar bad experience with batman arkham knights and even witcher 3 at launch. The experience for these games got better as the patches rolled in, so i expect the same for this.   The game is pretty playable and worth owning, be it now or later. Its just going to take some patch work, as with many games on the pc, to reach full potential.  PS: I think the devs made some pretty bad mistake with this game.

91458320,english,0,360430,"The game was fine before they added the 2K launcher. Now when you click to start game, you get a launcher than supposedly contacts 2K servers, and checks something (no permission from the user requested).  So you click to get launcher, click to start game, wonder about what the launcher (which wasn't necessary before) is doing in the background, and then click to exit game, and exit the launcher.  At what point did the devs in that company sit around a table and decide that this was what the game needed? I'd recommend their company gets some serious devs. The type that slim down the crap and maximise the gaming experience.  Uninstalled. Shame. Bought it a few months ago, and the game was largely fine, if occasionally buggy. If this is them sorting it, the code must have been seriously messed up, and the new devs were even more useless.

101094548,english,1,360430,"Having played the other Mafia games, I personally really enjoy this one. Is it my favourite? Not necessarily. However, I really loved the story and I found myself very attached to the characters. I found that they were all pretty unique, and I was thoroughly pleased to see Vito make an appearance. I will someday replay the game to see how it plays out with the other characters being in charge, but for now I'm satisfied.  I understand the frustration behind doing virtually the same task for each district, which is killing mob bosses and or interrogating them, destroying rackets, etc. At one point it was annoying but I did realise that it did have a significance to the story of the game, to some extent. They could've made that part more interesting, maybe have some unique scenarios for the different districts, and they could've also used different player models! I found it strange that the same henchmen that I killed were suddenly revived and working for the racket I just secured... strange. With the definitive edition I found that there were a few graphical glitches that took away from the immersion of driving aesthetically pleasing muscle cars whilst listening to 60s rock. Some cut scenes occasionally caused the game to freeze, which became a nuisance at times.  I would still recommend this to someone who hasn't played it, and I agree that it isn't for everyone, but I really like the liberty of completing different missions instead of only doing the main story, and just senselessly killing racists in freeroam. It definitely doesn't follow the traditional Mafia game progression but I can still appreciate the length of the story. If you're looking for something that resembles the previous Mafia games you may be disappointed. I think it's still worth a try, especially at its discounted price."

26027640,english,0,360430,"I've played through the game twice, A majority of my playing time is offline thus my hours aren't reflecting actual time in-game.  Good game but still feels as though we're being guided along the rails. This feels like a step back from Mafia 2. No clothes shops, no car workshops, no gas stations. Graphics were pretty blah out of the box, but after the patch that unlocked FPS and a ReShade preset, the game looks pretty good on a 1070 GTX. It ran consistently, based on the Steam overlay, at 56-57 FPS.  Pros:  -Little details - reactions to PC, witnesses calling in crimes, etc. The city feels alive.  -Environmental/Weather system (people use umbrellas when it's raining, streets get wet when it rains, and they gradually dry after rains)  -Story is very good  -Voice acting is exceptional  Cons:  -Weather system - sometimes it rained for days at a time, and weather changed far too abruptly at times.   -Side missions to increase racket income are repetitive and tedious. This is where a lot of time in the game will be spent as objectives are clear on the other side of the map from you.  -Enemy and Police AI needs some serious attention. Enemies were completely inept unless it was a scripted event. As far as police: No speeding tickets, I could ram into cars all day in front of police but if I accidentally bumped a civilian a 5 state all points bulletin happened.   -Motorist AI is horrendous. I experienced huge traffic jams in some areas of the city which made some missions impossible to complete.  -Buggy:  Had dual Cassandras and Burkes when I did the last of their personal missions, boats spawing on land, cars I needed to steal blowing up for no apparent reason before I could get to them. Disappearing icons - being told to go talk to so and so (while doing racket earning missions) and not being able to as the icons didn't appear on the map. My ""GPS"" path displayed would bug out occasionally turning into some super wide path that was impossible to follow, and many more.  -Unless you're a completionist, there's zero replay value. As stated above, racket earnings missions are extremely tedious and that alone is reason for me not to want to touch this game again.  -Locations get reused. ""Hey kill a pimp here.."" 30 minutes later, hey the boss is so dumb he went back to the same location the pimp was at. Kill him there."" With so many locations possible, this is just pure laziness.  -Different endings but really doesn't feel like it means much, because there's nothing after the little ending spiels. What happened to ""open world games"" letting the player continue playing after the main story is finished? This game could be so much more..  -DLC: First DLC, through free, offered outfits that should have shipped with the game.  tl;dr Good game if you're a ""one and done"" player. If you're looking for replay value I'd wait and see what future patches and/or DLC offer. As of now I can't recommend the game. It's buggy, should have never shipped with a 30 fps lock for PC players, and feels more hollow than it's predecessor.   *review edited to reflect release of first DLC*"
69697800,english,0,360430,"Was really digging this game and made it about halfway through. Then the latest update happened for the Definitive Edition. Now the game is unplayable. Choppy, laggy, no textures, etc. It says my computer doesn't have the specs to run it, even though there was never a single problem in the entire 32 hours I played before the update. Don't buy this game unless they fix it and make it playable again. Would appreciate a response from the developer/publisher, because a lot of people are having the exact same problems I am."

[h1]The good parts[/h1] - The story is interesting with a unique way of telling it - Gameplay has really improved over Mafia II - Cutscenes and animations are top notch - Soundtrack is awesome - World design is great, all the artists did a really good job on this - Graphics can look amazing at some times  [h1]The not so good parts[/h1] - AI is dumb, even on hardest difficulty you will find the game easy - Driving is easier than in Mafia II but it is a lot more awkward (even in the simulation mode) - Missions do get repetitive but not as much as people say - Open world aspect of the game is still lacking, there are still no things to do apart from main story and 3 generic side missions - Graphics can also look like PS2 game some times - Glitches and crashes do happen but will probably be fixed in the future  [h1]The only reason I recommend this game is because I did enjoy all 30+hrs on my first playthrough. The game is not bad at all, it just isn't as good as it could have been.[/h1]"
97149182,english,0,360430,"Fix for launcher issue:  Under steam right click on the game and go to Mafia 3 > Properties In the launch options at the bottom of the window, add the following command ensuring the location is correct:  ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mafia III\Mafia3DefinitiveEdition.exe"" %command%  Keep the quotations etc. just copy and paste so the exe file launches with %command% and it works. I'll keep my review as it was, below and update if/when I complete the game (assuming no other hitches)  I was enjoying the game, it looks great, story is good and it's an enjoyable setting, although gameplay loop is a little repetitive.  After 5 hours of play time, I cannot get past the launcher. Steam says its running, 2k launcher opens, but when I click on play it shows its running, and within seconds it stops and nothing loads. After a quick search, it seems like this is a common problem and reinstalling visual c++ redistributable didnt fix it, so I guess i'm done with the game. Shame as I was looking forward to finishing it and until now I had looked past the negative reviews and was enjoying it.   Basically, dont waste your time with it: ssems 2k have had this problem for some time and still have not resolved it so I dont hold hope that they will do now (Aug 2021)."
177702181,english,0,360430,"Good story, beautiful game. But, it has too many annoying bugs and glitches even years after released. I had to repeat some missions due to story not continuing certain points especially when chasing Greco with Vito, stupid cars also got destroyed too fast. The mission design is also repetitive that you better use a mod to reduce those tasks. Also, no fast travel in this open world, especially when I want to get back to the herb house for money. Finally, it really needs a manual save to load when you make mistakes or something. It could've been great, but 2K and Hangar 13 fcked it up with their laziness to fix it. The negative reviews are well deserved."
92753278,english,0,360430,"I first bought this game about 1.5 year ago, back when it was still just your regular Mafia 3 and not the illustrious Mafia 3: Definitive Edition. I actually liked it more than most - yeah, it was repetitive and some of the design choices I found just baffling, but still... it was fun enough to keep me going. Until, that is, I ran into a vicious little gamebreaking bug that caused my game to freeze on an infinite loadscreen.   Got frustrated, got over it, uninstalled the game, thinking I might give it another shot should they ever patch it up.   So, yeah, it's been a year and a half. Did they fix it?  Nope.   Real fuckin' definitve, guys."
134945692,english,0,360430,"One of the rare times where I wish Steam had a neutral recommendation. I think the story is a great idea on paper and the actual cutscenes, radio tunes and voice acting is pretty good. I love the idea of a mob revenge story set during the civil rights era where you play as a guy taking back his city, racket by racket, to avenge those close to him who were killed by the Italian mafia. It's way different than the first two games in tone, now you have more than just an opposing mob and the police force after you, you have actual racist, hate groups, Haitians and corrupt politicians as well. It feels serious, yet I cannot say the gameplay does the story and tone justice. Like everyone has said at this point, it is REPETITIVE. The majority of these missions play out exactly like this: drive to a district to talk to an NPC about a nearby racket that an enemy has conjured up, go to the same three mission types in the district and complete them till the game says you caused enough damage in funds to that racket, then go back to that same NPC and they will give you the exact location of the person who ran that racket, then go back to one of the mission areas you already completed and kill that guy, you take control over the racket, mission completed. Do that about fifteen or so times to take over the entire county and maybe you'll get a fun mission or two. There is optional missions, but these play out the same way, deliver this vehicle and kill this guy, literally all of them! And the thing is, the actual shooting and driving is fine, but it's just so boring seeing the same death animations, the same buildings, the same enemies over and over! Don't get me wrong, there is fun to be had, these repetitive missions weren't boring at first. It was just when I realized after a few hours of taking over rackets, that was almost the entire game! I wanted variety just like the first two games had. There was driving missions, sneaking missions, missions where you had to exclusively go in guns blazing and maybe a few that combined these elements in one big mission. I will also admit that these games didn't go out on the open world aspect, but it was for the better, because look at Mafia 3's version. I would be surprised if anyone actually liked this one over the previous two games. The actual story missions are decent, they have great cutscenes and I love the interactions between characters. Actually going inside a different building or area was a breath of fresh air. It was awesome seeing Vito again and working alongside him throughout the game. The problem is, they come way too far in between the racketeering junk. A big smack in the face? The DLCs have better mission designs! ""Faster, Baby!"" is the best one because you can destroy an entire county with this bada** vehicle and create your own weed strains, it's cool and the story for it is action packed all the way. Final thoughts: Mafia 3 is a disappointment and basically junk food. It's every mediocre open world game, Frankenstein stitched together with an interesting story and a 60's setting."
182893924,english,0,360430,"Mafia III is a game where you go from point A to point B to shoot a lot of guys before going back to point A to talk to a person to go shoot some more guys, usually ending in a mildly interesting set piece mission.  It's been done a thousand times before, and it's not what people come to play the Mafia series for."
161988765,english,1,360430,"Mafia 3 has both positive and negative aspects. A game that everyone had great hopes for.  ✅Soundtrack - the music is perfectly matched to the game, which takes place in 1968, ✅the story of the main character - memorable, allowing you to feel the role of a person who only wants revenge, ✅supporting characters - their presentation and manner of being in the game add an interesting atmosphere, ✅ prologue and story missions - a very interesting and engaging prologue that allows you to feel the atmosphere and story missions done at a very high level, ✅shooting system - we have pistols, rifles, snipers, shotguns and several unique weapons at our disposal. Perfect refinement of shotgun shooting, you can feel that you have a strong weapon.   ➖side missions - repetitive, interesting at the beginning, but after a few hours of gameplay boring and tiring, ➖ damage to vehicles - after hitting another vehicle at high speed, there is not much damage, but after hitting bushes or a fire hydrant, our vehicle is no longer suitable for driving, ➖NPCs - we are often lost by enemies, fighting them in some locations is very simple, there is no challenge at all, ➖police - I miss tickets for speeding or road collisions, the police in Mafi 3 are practically useless."
166578693,english,0,360430,"Honestly it's more of a meh for me. The story is interesting and funny, but is overshadowed by the repetitive game-play, go here kill this guy, than go kill these group of guys and get a main mission about killing this main guy. That is the entire game-play cycle, start to finish. The endings are honestly lackluster, and leave a lot to be desired.   I would recommend you pick it up in sale, third party, or at least buy the trilogy which would net you more bang for your buck. A cool concept and great story weighed down by horrible game-play."
92491256,english,1,360430,This game is good game with good and bad points I want say bad points in first place and explain how much this game is underrated Bad points are  1)fps drops and few bugs(i didnt see any crashes in my exprience) 2) repetitive missions if u want just finish story in fastest time(just play dlcs and side missions beside main missions till dont tired from main missions) 3)poor graphic and textures Good points: 1)amazing story and characters with great acting that u cant forget them for long time 2)musics 3)driving system 4)ending missions and enjoyable dlcs 5)variety of weapons and ways u can finish missions I cant understand this much of hating for this great game.i think 8/10 can be good score for this game

Including the DLCs this game is a FUN TIME above everything else, enthusing, controversial and brutal, anyone who says otherwise is a liar. - 10/10"
122396465,english,0,360430,"I finally managed to play this game, and finish it as well. Although I must admit I had fun playing it, I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone who does not know the Mafia game lore. If you have not played the previous games, this game is not for you, and if you played them, the ocassional nostalgia is what keeps you going. What I mean by that are the following positives of this game: + The story of the game is interesting, the protagonist is very well picked and introduced.  + You meet Vito Scaletta, the protagonist of Mafia 2, and if you're lucky, you might meet more Mafia 2 characters + Since I played the Definitive edition I had access to all DLCs which were interesting both story and content-wise +Stealth in this game is amazing, whether it's the silencer or takedowns, also throwing knives as dlc content were an awesome addition + The soundtrack is very good. I think that this pretty much sums up the positive aspects of the game for me personally, so let's move on to the negatives:  - As soon as I started the game, I had to try multiple options in the settings for the game to be playable. This game has been released long enough, there should've been some kind of a patch already to fix this, because playing on lowest settings is really hard to look at an unable to play with. - The game crashed rarely, but it crashed indeed.  - GPS has a mind of its own. If the mission allows multiple targets as a choice and I pick the closest one, I expect the gps to stay focused on that point without changing it to a further one. Why should I go from Point Verdun all the way to the Bayou if what I'm looking for can also be found in Point Verdun?  - More customization options, but worse customization options.  - The game is very much repetitive. If I didn't have the DLCs to change it up a bit, I would get bored much easier and quicker, which I eventually did after I finished the DLCs.   This game is actually not that bad, it has a hidden potential, but it also has many many things that need to be fixed. It is playable, it is mildly enjoyable, but it is mostly repetitive and unstable."
165231026,english,1,360430,"I get why people like it less than the other Mafia games, as it's very dissimilar. It's more of a Grand Theft Auto than anything else. The mission are repetitive indeed, and the enemy NPC's are basically walking practice dummies, but it is what it is - 50+ hours of casual fun. Loved the setting, rarely have I seen a city so well reproduced. The story itself, the diverse cast of side characters and backgrounds, and the music, were all excellent. I loved it, might not be everyone's cup of tea but I've enjoyed it just as much as I've enjoyed GTA games back in the day."
79765478,english,1,360430,"It plays like it came out in 2009 vs. 2016, but I'd recommend a play through anyway.  You have 2 choices of play style: Sneak or shoot em' out. If you sneak, there is a huge flaw in game mechanics. Each enemy will ""search"" for you and follow the exact same path the last one did allowing you to essentially stand there and knife them one by one until the whole place is empty. Boring, right? If you don't stand there, the enemies are still on this one path of searching and it just messes the game up. I suggest just shooting em. Go in with guns for the most part.   Story is great and the cut scenes don't drag out, however, it does become a sort of grind after several hours. Reminds me of GTA - drive over here, kill this person, drive back. Drive here.. etc etc.   Still recommend on sale as a time-consuming open world game."
118420123,english,0,360430,"I actually like this game but I can't recommend because it is very poorly optimized for PC and runs like garbage. The story is decent and the game play is ok but does get highly repetitive. Play this one on console if you have to, it's a much better experience"
25911615,english,0,360430,"Updated: This is not an acceptable game for 2016. The amount of glitches, repetitiveness, and lack of other missions, and jobs to do after you complete the story is poor. Mafia 3 tried hard to bring back the Mafia series, but it crashed and burned. I had so much hope for this game, but it turned out to be another No Man's Sky of 2016.  Original Post Below: This great video by CrowbCat shows the many things wrong with Mafia III PC version. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  This is what happens when you give a good game series to a different developer who has no idea on how to make proper video games. I had so high hopes for this game, but I was let down once again by the gaming industry.  This game is so awful. When I decided to play on PC, it was because I have a choice. I could choose my hardware, my software, my resolution, my framerate, and my graphics, but what Hangar 13 did is unacceptable. They locked the game to 30FPS, and their reason for that is: ""The team has been hard at work ensuring that Mafia III’s performance is consistent across all platforms, and right now the game runs at a solid 30 frames-per-second.""   That's the most bullshit I have ever heard in one sentence. Mafia III for PC is a console port. The game has so many problems when it comes to reflections, lighting, and no SLI support. The antialiasing just blurs the game to make the edges look better, the PC controls are horrendous, and the game is being upscaled from 720p. It's so damn hard to focus on the story aspect when the screen is tearing, the graphics are glitching out, things pop in at ridiculous distance, but wait, they are releasing a patch to make the game run over 60FPS, and fix the issues. Too late, you already screwed up the game's launch, and what you have done will not be forgotten. They did release the patch to unlock the framerate, but since they never optimized the game good, it still runs like shit. This was my birthday present, and it's the worst fucking birthday present I have ever gotten. Hangar 13 didn't deliver on their promise on putting time, and effort into their PC version. You had 5 fucking years to sort all this shit out, but you didn't. Nice job Hangar 13, you made a sequel to Mafia II worse.  Don't buy this game."
179728001,english,0,360430,"[i]As a first time player.[/i]  Mafia III nails the 1960s vibe with a detailed city and an incredible soundtrack that immerses you in its world. The first few hours are cinematic and gripping, but the excitement quickly fades.  I hate writing reviews without finishing games, but this one is boring af. It doesn’t make you feel like you’re part of the Mafia, instead dragging you into repetitive side quests that block progress to the main story. Cool unlocks, are locked behind tedious grind sessions. And without a fast travel system, getting around the massive city becomes a tedious time sink.  A promising start derailed by frustrating design choices."
182762819,english,0,360430,"Its just rinse and repeat. All the missions are the exact same thing with zero variation. The first few hours were so strong and I bet the story is amazing, but they extended the game 20 too long which is very evident from the idiotic mission design. Its just time wasting. Guess, Ill watch the cutscenes on Youtube as there is no way i'm spending 30 hours or so doing the exact same thing over and over again, Its insane."

Positive elements, noted by me:  - ""fatalities"" - lethla\non-lethal, depending on walking\running and weapon in your hands. Looks smooth and brutal. - Some characters are really interesting. - DLC missions are the best ones in the entire game (lol), excluding the prologue. There are more, but they are inconspicuous.  Should say special hate for critical bugs: - Cars' tires can't live longer than 20 seconds in chases. I mean all 4 tires will be broken after 20 seconds of any chase and enemies don't even need to shoot. Can you imagine how it makes impossible any chases? Can't even say how it is ridiculous. - Pedestrians-kamikadze. I think 80% of pedestrians choose the wrong direction to dodge your car and jump right under your tires. Funny? No, because there are cops (see previous bug). And because your car reacts to it inadequately.  Any words about seamless grind are unnecessary. Just avoid it in every possible way (I used cheats).

25900160,english,0,360430,"Nevermind the 30 FPS. (Fixed in patch 1.01)  - No saving, only one constantly overwriting checkpoint system. Want to re-play a mission or go for different decision? Well, you better start the game all the way from the start again then. - Contains a ton of incredibly lazy and boring, unskippable cutscenes where Clay talks with one of the minor story characters. All of them shot from exactly same camera angle, which never moves, and neither do the characters. They give no info related to the main story and did I mention they are unskippable. - Hold [DEL] as a default keybind. (Default keybindings have been improved in patch 1.01) - Game fails to detect native screen resolution. Was set 1600 x 900 on my 1920 x 1080 screen. - In-game options can't handle using Steam overlay. Enabling and then disabling Steam overlay while options menu is on closes the option menu, even if you are in middle of making changes. - Rolling menus, yes, you must wait for the menu to roll past Kill list, Assets, Journal tabs to get to Options. - All weapon stats in percentages, including ammo capacity. Freaking love these revolvers with 15% and semi auto pistols with 31% ammo capacity. - Mouse sensitivity settings are a mess. Mouse sensitivity in menus is extremely high, bringing sensitivity down to usable levels in menus brings in-game sensitivity to unusably low. Menu mouse behaviour also suffers from mouse de-acceleration. - The game has a backlighting profile for Logitech RGB keyboards, which only makes things worse. Just three red vertical stripes, does not illuminate keys that are actually bound for gameplay functions. - Lock opening QTE gets repetitive and old really fast. - Looks horrible because everything on screen is softened/blurred so heavily. For example faces at about 20 meter distance are blurred into solid brown blobs. No sharpness anywhere. No combination of graphics settings seems to fix this. - Death and money mechanics. When you die, instead of ""loading last save"" you lose 50% of your money and you continue with whatever ammunition you had when dying. Respawned with 5 ammo on the pistol and 3 on SMG. -> Go buy more ammo before getting back to action. - Camera positions when driving are way too low. There are near, medium and far camera positions, but none of them actually are set high enough to be properly able to see in front of you. This also adds to the bad looking graphics when ground textures are viewed from a flattened angle. - Deadlocked traffic jams that break ""follow that car"" missions. - Badly executed subtitles where long blocks of text are often cut in middle of sentences and the timings are off.   Mafia III manages to implement usability problems I've never even seen before. It is incredible that they have managed to put effort into making things worse from usability point of view.  Update: Nomimated for The “Failure to live up to expectations set by previous games in the series and made me regret having enough brand loyalty to pre-order it” Steam Award"
137642489,english,0,360430,The game is really bad. The district mechanics are very repetitive and thus boring. The game is more reminiscent of a Splinter Cell or Assassins Creed with repetitive tasks. The graphics are not to my taste either. The city is not very original. Everything looks kind of the same and the driving is very arcadey.
