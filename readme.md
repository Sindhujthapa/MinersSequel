## 0. Download data

* Check which [embeddings models](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html) are multilingual, and which languages are best suited for those models
* [Steam API](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/getreviews) for sentiment analysis (multiple languages, according to prior bullet)
  * List of games with total number of reviews [here](https://steamdb.info/stats/gameratings/?sort=reviews_desc)
* Look for sentiment datasets for additional testing (multiple languages, according to first bullet)

## 1. Basic Sentiment Classifier

* Logistic Regression
* Other Classifier models seen in class
* Based on Polarity scoring (check python libraries like [VADER](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/04-Sentiment-Analysis.html))

### 1.1 Benchmarks

* AUC, the other curve seen in class
* Learning curve (rate of learning depending on how many data we feed the model)

## 2. Embedding 

* Select some embedding models (english and multilingual)
* Train models with data (check last lecture code for this type of implementation)

### 2.1 Observations relevant for Krueger

* Does embedding capture sentiment? 
* If it does, can we compare between them (the embedding models) using the usual metrics?
* Can we train a embedding model with more than 1 language (spanish, french - check hierarchy of languages)

### 2.2 Benchmarks

* Same as 1.1
* Check what happens if: 
  1. Use English embedding with English data, 
  2. multilingual embedding with Spanish (other language) data, 
  3. multilingual with English

## Comparisons between 1 and 2

* Check how they compare with the Steam data
* Check how they do with data from other settings and how they compare
