182716635,english,1,105600,"I started playing Terraria since around Dec 2011-12 on the Xbox 360 and 2015 on Windows. and I've got to say, this game is one of the best games I've ever played. there are hundreds of ways that you can play the game, (some of which I've haven't even done yet!) Many Youtubers like Yrimir, stampylonghead and ChippyGaming made my childhood back in those days. I've kind of played this for so long, it's almost like an addiction. (a good one except.) To be honest, I wish I had money to buy the merch but I'm too broke. thanks for the memory’s, Re-Logic..."
178973002,english,1,105600,"Easily the best value for money game on Steam, and one of my all time favourites. This is the passion project of the developer and it shows with every update. No paid DLC, no microtransactions, just a good game. The game also has an active, endorsed modding community which just adds endless content."
178425411,english,1,105600,"difficult yet fun, goofy references, pretty cosmetics, great characters, wonderful building system, amazing combat, unique enemies, well-made events, perfect power balancing, cute pets, music as good as Undertale's and Hollow knights, active community, and most importantly, is not 2d Minecraft!"
172079747,english,1,105600,"The mods? Great. The gameplay? Great. The community? Questionable. The game? Worth the price."

186265741,english,1,105600,"I have over 2k hours in this game, and I think I can safely say it's infinitely replayable and incredibly enjoyable. Great bosses, fun stat progression, sandbox building, etc. Highly recommend."
189803352,english,1,105600,"What to say. What to say.   This game is the most beautiful, varied, challenging, and interesting game I have played.  I adore everything about this work from the art style to the comedic explosions of body parts that comprise most of the game's victories and deaths.    This game. It's incredible.   Hope you like it too."
177298579,english,1,105600,"A true labor of love and a shining icon of gaming, everyone on Earth should try Terraria at least once. The game has been a part of my life for over 10 years. It's a thrilling sandbox adventure with mostly linear progression, tons of content, and lots of replayability. They keep updating it every once in a while, and content-focused mods can elevate the experience even more. Like some games of its era, it can be a bit tough to get into without looking at the wiki a little bit. That's part of the experience, imo."

174828903,english,1,105600,"[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38888018-United-Critics/] Please follow [b]United Critics[/b] for quality reviews[/url]  [h2]Terraria Review[/h2]  [hr][/hr][h2] 👍/👎 Pros and Cons: [/h2][hr][/hr] [b] 👍Pros: [/b] [list] [*] I like the game's look. [*] The soundtrack is good. [*] The bosses are challenging. [*] The almost endless things to do in this game. [*] It takes a long time to complete the game. [/list] [b] 👎Cons: [/b] [list] [*] It’s very hard to learn at first. [*] Playing this game can easily leave you lost on how to move forward. [/list] [hr][/hr][h2] 🎮Gameplay: [/h2][hr][/hr] Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with a focus on exploration, building, crafting, combat, survival, and mining, which is playable both in singleplayer and multiplayer modes.   The player begins in a randomly generated world with only basic tools to progress. In order to craft better tools, the player will need to mine the starter ores, such as iron and tin. As you gather these resources, you can build a house to protect yourself and make better tools and armor to fight the monsters that spawn at night.  Also, you should be searching for life crystals if you want to increase your max health, and you should be searching for fallen stars if you want to increase your max mana. Mana is the ""ammo"" you need for your magic wands and items that need mana.  Once you have built a house, you need to build houses for the NPCs to live in. The NPCs can sell you useful items for the money you receive from defeating enemies. There is also a guide NPC who can give you hints on what to do. You can also find NPCs around the world who need help, and when you help them, they can move into your house.   It is time to explore the world and go deep into the mines to find better ores, but be aware because there are traps and strong enemies in the mines. If you don't have the appropriate pickaxe, you won't be able to mine all the ores at first. As well as the mines, you will have to go through the different biomes you will find in the game. Both are generated randomly.  Various world events may occur that make the enemies stronger, such as the blood moon, slime rain, etc. These events usually happen at night.   By destroying a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart, a meteor will fall in your world, which you can mine to craft some useful items.  You can do a lot in Terraria whether you're bored or not. You can start a building project or do side missions that NPCs give you, etc. The game does not require much grinding, but it takes a while to mine enough ores.  I think that much of the game should be discovered by the players themselves, so I'll leave you with just this and hope that you'll want to get into this awesome 2D game called Terraria.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌲Biomes: [/h2][hr][/hr] There are several different biomes in the game, including the snow biome, jungle, desert, and more. There are also biomes underground that have secrets to be discovered. I won't tell you much about the biomes since exploring is part of the game, but I will say that the biomes are well designed and interesting to explore. In the mines, you will find chests with loot that could be very useful.   [hr][/hr][h2] 📄🎩Bosses and some facts: [/h2][hr][/hr] I won't tell you about the boss's abilities and such, because I think you should discover that for yourself as you progress.   The bosses spawn when you have the right item and do a certain action with it, such as throwing it into lava or clicking on it. You can also summon bosses by speaking with some NPCs. Different areas have their own bosses to face. The bosses are well thought out, and the difficult ones are the ones near the end of the game so you don't just defeat them all with the bad loot and complete the game with that. Prepare yourself with potions and good equipment if you are going to take on one of these bosses.  To progress in the game, you must defeat the bosses, because that will result in you getting more items and unlocking things in your world that you couldn't do before. This is a 16-bit style game, and I think it suits the game well.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌎👕Options of your world and character customization: [/h2][hr][/hr] It is possible to change some stuff in your Terraria world such as the seed, the size, difficulty. You can also decide if there will be corruption or crimson in your world.  Various customization options are also available, including clothing and clothing colors, hairstyles, eye colors, and more.   [hr][/hr][h2] 💭Final Thoughts: [/h2][hr][/hr] If you're looking for something to play for a while and you want to always have something to do, then Terraria is the game for you. It has an excellent soundtrack and great features. The bosses are challenging, and the game takes a long time to complete. Overall, the game is excellent.   Rating: 8/10"
172184787,english,1,105600,"Not often do I review games I enjoy, but the mindless wave of negative reviews has made me want to write SOMETHING.  Terraria is a game of passion, obvious from the decade the developers have spent updating and improving on the already-solid framework. It features some of the best 2-D combat I've ever experienced, a gorgeous art style, and a very satisfying progression.  All this is not to mention the countless high quality fan-made mods - Calamity, Thorium, and many others add dozens (if not hundreds) of extra hours of gameplay. The players are just as passionate about this game as the developers.  Most negative reviews (at the time of writing) don't criticize the game itself, rather the fact the devs don't share their political ideologies. It's disappointingly childish. While the game does have its flaws, don't look to these reviews for them right now.  If, by some off-chance, you are reading this and have never played the game, try it out! It may introduce you to a new favorite! Don't let the drama scare you off."

171805287,english,1,105600,"In the beginning, without knowing anything about to the game, it may seem boring and somewhat dull, just like it was for me. But it turned out I was very wrong thinking in such way, after I got slightly further into the game, which had me devoured fully. The way progression works in Terraria is such a satisfying process to go through, even if sometimes, it my get a bit grindy, be it the bosses or or looting tons of materials. Hours of non-stop playing were spent on it, and I fully admit that it was worth it! In addition to that, I hope that new players of the game, that have never seen it before won't stop after an hour of first time gameplay, because the seemingly boring beginning will eventually turn out into a very fun, long and entertaining journey, full of various emotions on the way. It is a perfect example of ""not judging a book by its cover,"" at least for my personal experience."
176468497,english,1,105600,"terraria is a game that is slow at first but after you defeat a few bosses it speeds up, my first playthrough was with a friend has had played the game alot and he teached my alot about the game."
168443820,english,1,105600,single-handedly the best bang for your buck on the entire gaming market. 6$ (3$ if its on sale) for infinite replayability. also you can pet the dog
181740663,english,1,105600,"Terraria was and remains the best survival sandbox game on the market. Re-Logic outdoes themselves with every update and demonstrates a seemingly endless commitment to fine-tuning and improving the game, despite it being in a “finished” state for nearly a decade.  Where other games fall prey to development hell, Terraria gives us a glimpse into the rare development heaven. If there is anyone left in 2024 who hasn’t yet played Terraria, they owe it to themselves."
191818555,english,1,105600,"Terraria starts off as this humble 2D sandbox game about digging, crafting, and fighting, but once you throw mods into the mix, it transforms into an absolute monster of creativity and chaos—especially if you’re brave enough to tackle the Calamity Mod.  At its core, Terraria is a game about exploring a massive world, gathering resources, and facing off against waves of increasingly bizarre enemies. But once you dip your toes into the modding scene, the world expands to infinite proportions. Calamity Mod is the be-all-end-all expansion that turns your Terraria world into a living nightmare of epic bosses, new biomes, insane loot, and a whole new level of difficulty. Want to battle gods, summon ancient celestial entities, and break your controller over insanely tough bosses? Calamity’s got you.  Without mods, Terraria is already addictive enough with its endless crafting, treasure hunting, and massive bosses. But with Calamity, you're not just fighting the regular Eye of Cthulhu—you’re fighting Calamitas, Supreme Calamitas, Providence, the Profaned Goddess, and a whole army of high-level bosses that will make you question your life choices. And don’t even get me started on the massive post-Moon Lord content—if you thought you had completed the game, think again.  Mods in general expand Terraria into a whole new world. The Thorium Mod, Spirit Mod, and Tremor Mod all add unique biomes, bosses, and mechanics, making the game feel fresh even after hundreds of hours. New weapons? You got 'em. New events? Check. Even cosmetic mods can make the game look prettier, or add weird stuff like making your character a floating pancake.  One of the coolest things about Terraria with mods is that it’s still very much its own game. Mods like Calamity don’t just add a bunch of content—they integrate seamlessly into the core game. You won’t feel like you’re playing a completely different game; it’s more like you’ve opened a Pandora’s box of insanity. It’s got all the classic Terraria charm—digging, building, crafting—but amped up to 11, with new dimensions to explore, terrifying bosses, and new mechanics to wrap your head around.  And multiplayer? Chaos, pure chaos. You and your friends can team up to fight the crazy new bosses, explore newly crafted worlds, and argue over who gets the best loot.  In short, if you’ve been playing Terraria without mods—good for you, you’re in for a solid time. But if you’ve never experienced Calamity, prepare to lose weeks of your life fighting, dying, crafting... and then dying again. It’s a whole new game that never stops surprising you.  11/10 giant bosses, 100% chance of calamity. Would die to Supreme Calamitas again."
185319451,english,1,105600,"lots of fun played with my friend and beat it twice highly reccomended but is a little complicated but still great  also its not 2d minecraft its diffrent"
186786534,english,1,105600,"Ignore all negative reviews. This game is the 2nd best game i have ever played. If you know what you are doing then it is so fun. Each world has unique generation that makes each play-through of this masterpiece different. Their are super fun bosses items to craft Npc's that each make this game that much better. If you somehow get lost, their are countless tutorials on social media platforms like youtube that you can watch."
186187288,english,1,105600,"The game is fabulous, but a bit more handholding at the very beginning would be nice, because the moment the game started, I had no idea what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to build anything or use my inventory, so the first few minutes were horrendous, and I was dying quite a lot, which reminded me why I instantly deleted this game many years ago when trying to play it for the very first time. This time around I decided to keep at it, and the first 10–15 hours were slow, but then I got the hang of it, and the game consumed me to the point where I lost track of time and racked up 100 hours just completing the main story and hunting for some achievements. Be prepared to keep your browser running in the background, because you are probably going be switching between the game and the Terraria Wiki quite a lot."

174969244,english,1,105600,"For the last time, just because a game is a sandbox game with cubes as building blocks, doesn't make it a minecraft ripoff."
175679313,english,1,105600,"Very fun game, a lot to do. I played a lot in my childhood and have made many great memories playing this game. I would definitely recommend this game."
166441555,english,1,105600,"If you want a fun game, this is it. If you want a unique game, this is it. If you want a game you can come back to and play again and again, this is it. (And thats without getting into modding) Does it have it's quirks? Of course, but what great game doesnt? Either way, this is a game is a must if you just want to have a good time."
177861355,english,1,105600,"First of all, this is NOTHING like Minecraft other than being pixel-themed. I don't know why people think that! Do you see guns in Minecraft? No. Is this game 3D? NO. Are there fireflies in Minecraft? NO! This game is more centered on making more out of it's limited world, rather than trying to use an infinite one. The game is centered on fighting and sometimes mining to get resources to eventually destroy the final boss. There's a MASSIVE selection of everything from fighting playstyles, to enemies, and so much post-endgame things to do. If you have the money, just buy it man, its only 10 bucks. WAY less than 30! But if you CAN but the four pack and get one copy for free alongside it so thats cool."
193376652,english,1,105600,"Was finally able to beat the Wall of Flesh and now I'm at the hardmode. The game's been pretty fun, I've been doing some Angler's quests for the past few months and mining cobalt ores as well as farming for the Rod of Discord."
179363539,english,1,105600,"I re-visit this game quite often since 2016 and I always find new stuff to play. Among so many games that ask you $60 for some garbage not even worth playing (especially last 5 years), this game is not the case. Oh baby not at all. No matter how old this game will ever become in 10 or 20 years, Terraria will remain one of the very few masterpieces out there."
187449473,english,1,105600,"A potentially good game. I say that because if it's you're first time playing the game, I suggest you play solo or with other players who have the same level of experience as you.  As a beginner playing with veterans, early game is just a blur. With you fumbling around and trying to figure things out. While your more experienced friends start exploring the world at a fast pace. By mid game, you just feel left out and the game becomes more or less unrewarding. Most of the easily accessible chests have already been opened and all ""limited"" loot in the world have already been taken.  Picture this. Your friends flying in the are dawning shiny armor and weapons with cool effects while you still wear the basic craftable armor and craftable weapon. And every time you explore and come across a chest, expecting to finally get some cool loot yourself. Only to open it and find it empty. Not fun at all.  It's not until mid to late game where you start getting the hang of things and start to feel useful and maybe get some good loot here and there. -- At the cost of extensively reading the wiki to bridge the gap in experience so you somehow know what you want to do and have your own personal goal.  Pros - Lots of different weapons - Dynamic environment - random events, biomes spreading, etc - Interactive and unique NPCs - Lots of blocks, building and decorative pieces  Cons - Bosses are terribly unbalanced with multiplayer - Some lootable items have a limit to how many there are in the world - World size limit - Not much to do after killing the last boss"
170363426,english,1,105600,"Bought this game a very long time ago, played the crap out of it. Went back into it on and off for years, just recently started up again. Man this game is fun and stressful as hell, but for what it is I enjoy this game immensely. Mind you this is with no mods or anything too change from the game's out of the box experience. What I will say this game has so much to do and if you want to look like a crazed hobo in a raincoat, mining pants, wizard hat & a summoned attacking finch with bird nest on your head you can. As i've become a lot older more single player games that I can get lost in things and have fun at my pace is more valuable over anything multiplayer. I would highly recommend this game to anyone."
190515992,english,1,105600,"Terraria is definitely one of the games of all time. I've played this game on the 3DS when I was young, and it's the reason I had steam in the first place.  Genuinely great game for its price. (Oh yeah you can piss on your enemies as a mage)"
190966322,english,1,105600,"I remember when my cousin show me this game on Xbox 360 probably over 10 years ago. I loved it so much and had some much fun playing it with him and not knowing anything about the game. At the time I would go as far as saying this game is better than Minecraft, but now Minecraft is it's own game and so is Terraria! I love this game and see how it come over the years and switch to PC after awhile just made me love this game even more! When the do BIG update to the game its like having to relearn the game as if its a fresh start! this was the journeys end update! They keep bringing me back and I hope they don't stop updating and making more, and if they have to switch the software they use this game is codded on instead of them making a seperate game it would be better for them to call it a update verses a Terraria 2  So yes if you are new to this game I highly recommend you try it out! slow at first but once you start discovering things it doesn't end until you have hours on this game!"
175775071,english,1,105600,"A great sandbox adventure game that offers a ton of exploration, crafting, and combat. With its 2D pixel art style, you can dig, build, and fight through randomly generated worlds. It’s like Minecraft meets classic action RPGs. There’s always something to do, whether it’s defeating bosses, building intricate structures, or just exploring underground biomes. It's easy to lose hours in this game. Great for solo or with friends."
193141425,english,1,105600,"Classic survival & RPG crossover sandbox game with a HUGE learning curve(free wiki DLC), honestly a lot more fun than Minecraft, the amount of content the game has to offer is mind-blowing. This game is the reason why I made a steam account.  My preferred way to play is probably much different from others as I don't care to boss rush and bullet hell isn't my thing, but there is really no right way to play this game, as long as you have fun."
187356333,english,1,105600,"yes good game 👍 • better than minecraft • has drills • has more ores • has a wall of flesh • has a floating eyeball • has a floating brain that has a heart • has a sentient carnivorous plant • has a massive sentient blob of slime • you can see stuff that your character definitely cannot see • has bosses • bosses are hard • has difficulty modes that actually change the game  instead of only making enemies do more damage • has health potions that you can drink instantly • combat system is better (its 2d) • has pixels • is less ugly than minecraft • accessories • reforges"

You can gather resources, craft weapons and armor, and create things for your home. The game has many different places where you can discover surprises, bosses, and unique enemies, making it very diverse!  The best part is the ability to play with friends! You can explore the world together, making it even more fun. The graphics are cute and pixelated, while the music helps set the atmosphere.  Updates make the game even more interesting by adding new features and items (it's a shame they come out very rarely). Overall, Terraria is a great entertaining experience for those who love adventure and creativity.  The game is worth the money spent on it! RU:  Terraria — это игра, где ты можешь исследовать большой мир, строить свои дома и сражаться с врагами.  Когда ты начинаешь, у тебя есть только несколько простых инструментов. Ты можешь добывать ресурсы, делать оружие и броню, а также создавать вещи для своего дома. В игре много разных мест, где можно находить сюрпризы, боссов и уникальных врагов, что делает игру очень разнообразной!  Самое классное — это возможность играть с друзьями! Можно вместе исследовать мир, делая это еще веселее. Графика в игре милая и пиксельная, а музыка помогает погрузиться в атмосферу.  Обновления делают игру ещё более интересной, добавляя новые фишки и предметы(печально, что они выходят очень редко). В общем, Terraria — это отличное развлечение для тех, кто любит приключения и творчество.  Игра достойна потраченных на неё денег!"

There are countless items to discover and use for different purposes. It offers a lot of fun and challenges, suitable for those who love creative and adventure gameplay."
181651390,english,1,105600,"I can't handle 3D environments very well, so a certain other sandbox game is out for that reason. Terraria doesn't lose at all in my mind, however. I often fall into a sort of a trance, exploring the worlds... The lively playerbase and continuing updates even so long after the game's release are really nice, too!"
177012958,english,1,105600,"Terraria is such a fun little adventure! 🌟 You can spend hours just exploring, building your dream home, and fighting 2D (sometimes fierce!) creatures. It’s like a sandbox where you can let your creativity run wild—whether you want to dig deep for treasures or build the coziest little cottage.  The graphics are charming, and there’s always something new to discover, especially when you play with friends! It’s the perfect mix of crafting, exploration, and a bit of whimsy."
184676599,english,1,105600,"If you're into crafting and building while fighting off hoards (and then slaying bosses in order to get more things to craft and weirder creatures to come after you), this is your game.

186971219,english,1,105600,"Terraria is one of the most creative and addictive sandbox games ever made. It combines exploration, building, and combat in a 2D world filled with endless possibilities. At first glance, some people might compare it to Minecraft, but Terraria offers a unique experience with its deep progression system, challenging bosses, and rich world-building.  One of the best things about Terraria is its sense of adventure. Players start with basic tools and must gather resources to survive. As they dig deeper underground, they discover valuable ores, hidden treasures, and dangerous enemies. The game constantly rewards exploration, making every new cave or biome exciting to discover. From dark dungeons to glowing mushroom forests, the variety of environments keeps the game fresh.  Combat in Terraria is another highlight. The game has a wide range of weapons, from swords and bows to magic spells and futuristic laser guns. Each weapon feels different, allowing players to develop their own playstyle. The boss fights are especially intense and require skill, strategy, and good equipment. Defeating bosses unlocks new items and materials, pushing players to keep progressing.  Building is also a major part of Terraria. Players can design and customize their own houses, castles, or even entire cities. The game offers hundreds of decorative items, furniture, and blocks to create unique structures. NPCs move into the player’s town as they progress, offering useful items and services. This system makes the world feel alive and encourages players to expand their settlements.  Terraria is a game that never gets boring. With its deep progression, challenging combat, and limitless creativity, it offers something for everyone. Whether playing solo or with friends, the game provides an unforgettable adventure filled with surprises. Even after hundreds of hours, there’s always something new to discover, making it a true masterpiece of the sandbox genre."

185087280,english,1,105600,"Best bang for your buck out there, this game is so cheap (especially if you get the 4-pack) it's almost criminal. This game is the most fun I've had in a survival crafting game that lets you build whatever you want, house NPCs inhumanely, and go from average Joe to a god-killer using a plethora of weapons, armours, and equipments allowing you to specialize in 1 of 4 classes. Also super easy to mod using tModLoader on Steam for free for when you want to experience even more than vanilla Terraria has to offer."

You can play it with friends which is amazing, lot of bosses (thus far I got 2 and they both nailed me).  Very cool game for exploration, mining, different enemies, different opportunities etc. I just think its much more, thus far I loved it and I hope it stays that way.

Your journey begins with a wooden sword and ends with you [b]punching the literal moon[/b]. The progression? Less ladder, more slingshot directly into your worst nightmares.  2. NPCs are helpful—as long as you don’t mind them [b]living in lava[/b] and charging full price for bombs while you’re [i]on fire[/i].  3. [i]“Hardmode”[/i] is just Terraria’s way of saying, [b][i]“Oh, you thought this was difficult? Hold my beer.” [/i][/b]  4. The Moon Lord isn’t the final boss. No, the real endgame is trying to build a house that isn’t an [b]architectural crime scene[/b] while your friends throw explosive bunnies everywhere.  5. Fishing is somehow the most peaceful [u]and[/u] infuriating activity in the game. [i]I came here to relax, not spend hours looking for a fish that apparently only spawns on its birthday.[/i]  [b][i]Gameplay: [/i][/b] Terraria is what happens when you hand a child a crayon box, tell them, [b][i]“Go nuts,” [/i][/b] and then unleash that chaos upon the world. One minute, you’re building a charming little treehouse. The next, you’re defending your base against an army of goblins determined to turn your peaceful existence into a demolition derby. It’s [b]unpredictable, magical, [/b] and [i]borderline terrifying[/i].  Every biome feels like its own twisted little theme park—complete with treasures, traps, and creatures that range from adorable to [b][i]“Oh god, why does it move like that?!” [/i][/b] You’ll be hooked chasing new goals, crafting wild weapons, and discovering creative ways to die ([i]looking at you, dynamite[/i]).  [b][i]Graphics and Sound: [/i][/b] The pixel art is [b]deceptively charming[/b]—like a warm hug before a giant worm erupts from the ground to eat you. And the music? [b][i]It slaps harder[/i][/b] than an Eater of Worlds at 3 a.m. The boss themes alone will either send you into a fight-or-flight frenzy or have you Googling [i]“How to survive Skeletron.” [/i]  [b][i]Community: [/i][/b] The Terraria community is a beautiful mix of [b]geniuses, chaos goblins, [/b] and [i]meme lords.[/i]  Need help figuring out how to survive Hardmode? [b][u]They’ve got you.[/u][/b] Need memes about the Guide summoning the Wall of Flesh again? [b][i]Oh, they’ve definitely got you.[/i][/b]  [b][u]Pros: [/u][/b] [list] [*] An [b]infinite sandbox[/b] of fun, frustration, and existential crises [*] Boss fights that will test your [b]skills and your will to live[/b] [*] Building mechanics that let you channel your [b]inner architect[/b]—or [i]inner troll[/i] [*] Fishing.

[*] Inventory management is a [b]full-time job.[/b] [*] Friends who build [b]dirt houses[/b] while you’re busy dodging meteors. [/list] [b][i]Final Thoughts: [/i][/b] Terraria is the gift that keeps on giving—and occasionally [b][i]slapping you in the face with a slime.[/i][/b] Whether you’re conquering dungeons, accidentally summoning the wrong boss, or trying to organize your [b][i]14,000 chests of loot,[/i][/b] there’s always something new to love ([u]and rage about[/u]).  If you haven’t played it yet, [b][i]what the heck are you doing?[/i][/b] If you have, [b][u]welcome back.[/u][/b] I know you’re here to complain about bats, too.

The amount of bosses and enemies you can fight, the amount of things you can build achieve collect is incredible. I used to always play this on console when I was younger and I recently got it again for christmas, 2024. So many waves of nostalgia. I've played everyday so far since I got it with my brother in our world.  You can build bases, homes .exc and get npc's to move in which I think is great.  The style of the game might not be to everyone's liking but trust me, it builds on you. For this price, I'm certain it's top 5 best games you can get!

169900485,english,1,105600,"Terraria: The only game where you can go from chopping trees and building a cozy cabin to summoning giant, eldritch horrors in your backyard. It’s like Minecraft, but with way more insanity. You’ll start with a copper pickaxe and end up wielding a sword that shoots cats. Digging tunnels for hours is a thing, only to realize you’ve created a monster-infested maze. And just when you’re feeling safe, a blood moon rises and your cute little house becomes a zombie nightclub. Pro tip: the guide may seem helpful, but he’s probably giggling while you accidentally summon a giant floating eyeball that wants to eat your face. Play with friends to share the laughs, screams, and endless ‘did you just see that?!’ moments. It’s an unpredictable, hilarious adventure from start to finish!"
172186259,english,1,105600,The game is getting bad reviews because the devs change body types from male/female to body types...  So here's my positive review to counter at least one review from the fragile mob.
172134061,english,0,105600,"The removal of binary genders is not an ""inclusive"" update. You are deliberately removing the options that the extreme absolute majority of players use for their characters. You are excluding almost everyone to please hardly anyone.  If you are this comfortable with heavy handed policy then I am out - I don't want anything to do with any of your games and I will not recommend them to friends. The worlds we build are our own damn business - we paid you for that privilege and now you're changing the deal after you got rich from the customers you now look down upon.  Terrible anti-consumer business practice. Avoid this dev and play games that respect player choice."

Somewhat playable on a 4k monitor, but would not recommend for the steam deck. the controls work amazingly since 1.4.3 (keep in mind while it does have controller support, it’s not on the same as the official console ports on consoles)"

171092732,english,1,105600,"Terraria is an absolute gem in the world of sandbox games, offering an expansive and richly detailed universe that continually surprises and delights. From the moment you step into this pixelated realm, you're greeted with a vibrant world brimming with life, danger, and endless possibilities. The game's aesthetic, reminiscent of classic 2D platformers, is charmingly retro yet packed with an incredible depth of detail and creativity.  One of Terraria's most remarkable features is its vast and varied environments, each teeming with unique flora, fauna, and treasures. As players dig, fight, explore, and build, they encounter a plethora of biomes, from the verdant Forest to the eerie Crimson and the shimmering Underground Hallow. Each area presents its own challenges and rewards, encouraging exploration and discovery.  The game's progression system is both rewarding and addictive. Starting with rudimentary tools, players gradually collect resources to craft increasingly powerful weapons, armor, and accessories, allowing them to tackle tougher enemies and bosses. The sense of accomplishment from conquering these formidable foes is immense, and the thrill of unlocking new content keeps the experience fresh and exciting.  Moreover, Terraria boasts a vibrant community and a wealth of mods, which add even more layers of customization and replayability. Whether playing solo or with friends, Terraria offers an endlessly enjoyable experience that marries creativity with challenge. It's a game that truly stands the test of time, continually captivating and inspiring its players."

163905368,english,1,105600,"Terraria is one of the few games which I return to occasionally for ages and still gives me a damn lot of fun. I discovered this game in 1.1 version as a kid, when a lot of QoL features were not presented [spoiler](no auto door opening!)[/spoiler], mechanical bosses were the final ones, wood blocks and life crystals were broken with axes and hammers. Back in the day, multiplayer Minecraft was my main game, making me think that Terraria is just a 2D Minecraft clone.  ...But this turned out to be wrong at some point. Nowadays Terraria's distinctive features are [i]extensive progression system[/i] (each boss killed provides you new content and challenges), [i]different bosses and events[/i] to ensure that the show never ends, and [i]lots of weapons, accessories and armor sets[/i] to make your own fighting style. With this being said, Terraria is more like an [i]action-oriented adventure game with some grind on occasion[/i] [spoiler](fuck you angler! gonna feed you to some [url=https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/wiki/Trasher]alligator[/url])[/spoiler] rather than a survival sandbox (though you can play like this with proper configuration).   And this is the reason why it's extremely enjoyable to play! There's a lot of action, events and bosses to challenge, and you don't have to limit the fun due to being afraid of losing your loot in far away lands. Add mods that expand progression even more and difficulty levels (that not only make enemies tougher, but provide you with unique loot) to the equation, and you get a game that can entertain you for hundreds of hours.  And all of that for [i]10 dollars[/i], without tons of DLCs??? Gimme four! That's what good ol' days indie game industry looks like!  10/10, the game that went from simple 2D sandbox into [i]the fucking god-slayer adventure game[/i]. Aged like fine wine.

When i was growing up we imagined we were Xenomorphs, Yautja, Dragons and all sorts of humanoid heroes. Imagination let us think 'how would these characters feel' instead of the current trend of 'me me me me' that wants to replace all characters in a story with a mirror.  If this trend keeps up there will be no fantasy IP's in the future, just re-hashed hollywood style pigeonholed/washed characters that are exactly the same in every.single.story"

You'll find yourself experiencing a vast amount of boss fights, crazy underground biomes and more. I'd personally say the game is both equally enjoyable as a solo player and when playing with friends. It's worth it when at full price and even more of a steal when on sale."

167918926,english,1,105600,"Where do I begin... My Terraria journey started a long time ago with Stampy's Letsplay. I was a long time stampy fan. At a similar time, either shortly before or shortly after, I stumbled upon Terraria in the Xbox 360 store. I downloaded the free demo, and it was a blast. A few years after, I pirated the then latest Terraria version 1.3.3 on my dad's laptop. I found out about youtubers such as Khaios and Chippy, which are still my favourites. It was only at the end of may 2020, my birthday, and iirc, the release of 1.4, when I got my dad to buy me Terraria on steam. A couple weeks ago, I bought Terraria on steam for my best friend, and we play multiplayer from time to time. This game has been one of my favorite for almost a decade, dethroning Minecraft along the way and becoming my number 1 favourite game, and I love it. This game will always have a place in my heart. Thank you, devs, for making the best game I've ever played."
172806925,english,0,105600,"Just not my kind of game. Too much vertical progression vs very minimal horizontal progression. Character and build size too small making simpler structures hared to work with. Everyone rushes in multiplayer and usually doesn't bother making nice structures. Too much mining, grinding, and gathering vs actual exploration outside of super early game. Far too spammy and chaotic with all the enemy spam and general boss design.  I just never found this game very enjoyable outside of playing it with friends and the social interaction derived from such. It's way too grindy/stats-focused and the pacing too off for me to ever play it in singleplayer. I get why people like it, it's just that those same reasons are often why I don't like it."

82815094,english,1,105600,"I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.  Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further.   Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime.   After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on.   With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.  I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me.   Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors.   Sincerely, Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen"

I have pirated the game and then I have bought game several times for myself, and several times as a gift for others. I have played the game solo, with friends, with my girlfriend and planning to introduce it to my daughters (who were born since the game launched). I have spent hundreds of hours on 1.0... hundreds of hours on 1.1... on 1.2... on  1.3... and planning to spend hundreds more on 1.4. I have built, fought, explored, created wild-life reservation worlds as well as apocalyptic wastelands...   So I guess, it's not that bad game after all."
32026626,english,1,105600,"Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10"
47798793,english,1,105600,"So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria:   - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements - It has an incredible amount of content to it - Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class) - Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy - A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight - Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now) - Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped!  - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore! - I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTING  Cons? Hmm.  - Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized! - Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though. - Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me. - Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game.   Other thought:  - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.  Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):  I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.  Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.  There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is.   I spent $10 on this."

The game has one of the best communities of any game I have ever played. Not to mention modding is now supported on steam (see Tmodloader) and the modding community is actually CRACKED.

80853945,english,1,105600,"This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a game, and I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offline, as well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years ago, I asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap, 10 US dollars at the time, which is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this game, as well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to download, I was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retro, and the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to time, ripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldn’t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the game, the music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own character, so many different styles and colours, so many choices and personalization’s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first character, and after that, I was set out into a mysterious world, filled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shuriken’s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hill, I had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every direction, and with demon eyes flying overhead, death was inevitable.  As soon as I respawned, my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventually, we held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay in, and that’s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building.   There are so sososososososo many blocks to build, hammer and axe together in intuitive, creative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for building, as the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing builds, and it only got better with each update. There was sloping blocks, paint, different walls, how each block melded together, how each block interacted with other blocks, the light sources, the different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform.   After I was done building my house, I set out to find more loot to plunder. That’s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for me, so the combat was less punishing then I’d like it to be, but the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfying, even hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculately, precariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which way, you have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think you’ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of fire, the game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.  The gameplay loop is a satisfying composition of combat, farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPC’s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boom, rare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the future, skipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the game, it has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the last, and it keeps pushing you forward, to the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straight, and I only got 1. I did other stuff in between, sure, but the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewarding, it is peaceful at times.  With the Journeys end update, the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftop, listening to the songs and watching my NPC’s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this game, its not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its community, from steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic game, and I could not recommend it more.  I absolutely adore this game, and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years. My words could never do it justice, even though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to me.   Thanks for reading 😊"

76984308,english,1,105600,"[h1] 💻/📱 Description: [/h1] Terraria is among the BEST if not [b] the best [/b] game of this [b] decade, [/b] which surprises me considering its very low price. The content is beyond overwhelming with many bosses, challenges and options that you won’t ever get bored of. The game revolves around [b] you [/b] the player, as the difficulty and gameplay change depending upon your progression. The art style and music are very exceptional, bringing us the fanbase pleasant memories even to this day.  [h1] 📖 Setting: [/h1] [h3] Summary [/h3] Terraria is a land full of mystery and wonder. You the adventure are given the task to cleanse this magical world from the spreading [b] cancer [/b] called Hollow/Corruption. Many powerful beings will stand in your way, so grab some loot, find allies and restore the balance. Since many players forget the fact that Terraria includes a story in the first place. I suggest you read the lore from the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Lore] Wiki [/url] to get accustomed to the plot.  [h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1] Terraria refers to casual and hardcore players alike. You can slay forces or start creating buildings, without though being obliged to do so. The game offers a variety of blocks and items that encourage creativity. You can even build your mini-golf park! The goal here is to have fun and not just constantly grind for loot.  [h3] Difficulty [/h3] The actual Difficulty mode is a character set selected during character creation. There are 5 types of difficulty: Softcore, Mediumcore, Hardcore and the newly added [b] Journey [/b] mode that can only be played on journey worlds. All the above-mentioned modes change the penalty upon death.  [table] [tr] [th] Description[/th] [th] Difficulty [/th] [/tr] [tr] [td] Characters start with extra equipment [/td] [td] Journey [/td]  [/tr]  [tr]  [td] Characters drop [b] coins [/b] upon death [/td]  [td] Classic [/td]  [/tr]  [tr]  [td] Characters drop [b] items [/b] on death [/td]  [td] Mediumcore [/td]  [/tr] [tr]  [td] Characters cannot [b] respawn!! [/b]  [/td]  [td] Hardcore [/td]  [/tr]  [/table]  Another form of difficulty is [b] world modes. [/b] Those are separate settings that apply to the [b] world, [/b] rather than the [b] character. [/b] Players may choose between Journey, Classic, Expert, and Master mode when creating a new seed. Each mode provides more loot, as well as special accessories depending on the difficulty you have chosen. I advise [b] new [/b] players to start with the Classic mode, as Expert and Master are very demanding for a novice adventurer. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894347971 [h3] Starting your adventure [/h3] Terraria starts its gameplay slow and steady, as it should be. You begin your journey with only 3 tools (sword, axe, pickaxe) at your disposal and a companion useful for his crafting guides. It’s up to [b] you [/b] the player whether you want to challenge the game since your imagination, skill and creativity shape the word and thus the adventure. As a tip, I suggest you start building a small house in the beginning. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894343444 [h3] Interactive playstyle [/h3] Terraria forces [b] you [/b] the player to manipulate the environment to survive. You can chop trees used for crafting; mine rocks used for building or combine all the materials to cross large gaps etc. Physics plays a major role in the game’s playstyle, so do expect lots of deaths caused by [b] fall damage. [/b] There is also a small detail concerning nightfall, but that’s a surprise for you to explore. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894342641 [h3] Scaling [/h3] [b] Grinding [/b] Terraria is very famous for its grinding potential. There are many repeatable bosses, each offering different and unique [b] treasure bags [/b] that are considered valuable for your future encounters. Countless items offered by a specific boss or gained by certain activities, such as fishing, have a very low [b] drop percentage [/b]. This concept favours repeatability, so do be patient, as sometimes even the best things in life take a while.  [b] Classes [/b] There are 4 classes in Terraria: Magic, Ranged, Melee and Summoning. Each class requires different armour sets and weapons that provide unique stats and abilities, depending upon the material they were made from. It is most favourable to stick with 1 class during a playthrough, as this way you can aim your focus on specific items and equipment. Read the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Class_setups]Wiki [/url] and choose carefully which role to main first.  [b] Loot [/b] There are lots of accessories, mounts as well as vanity items with interesting [b] specialities [/b] that bring joy to competitive and creative players alike. A perfect example is the [b] Cloud in a Bottle [/b] which grants the user the ability to extra-jump midair. You can combine the accessories to create even stronger ones in the Tinkerer's Workshop. There are countless combinations, so take your time while reading the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Tinkerer%27s_Workshop]Wiki. [/url]   [h3] Wiki, Wiki and more Wiki [/h3] Overall, the experience is amazing, however, the learning curve is extremely demanding. This is a feature that does not go well with many players. As you have noticed above, you [b] will [/b] have to consult the [b] wiki [/b] regularly to truly master the game. Otherwise, you going to encounter many problems and difficulties that eventually will lead to confusion. Terraria is [b] very [/b] grind demanding game, so bring some friends in your journeys as co-op is more than encouraging!  [h1] 👁‍🗨 Visuals: [/h1] Terraria runs pretty well even on a [b] potato [/b] Pc. It is a small game with a gorgeous yet simple artstyle that continues to captivate me to this day. The game runs smoothly in low settings with minor loading times. In the rare case you encounter problems with performance, I suggest you turn off the effects.  [h1] 🎧 Audio: [/h1] Terraria’s music is [b] exceptional [/b] in its way. Every biome, boss as well as event has its unique song that fits the theme. I encourage you to buy [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/409210/Terraria_Official_Soundtrack/] Terraria: Official Soundtrack [/url] as it proves to be a piece of excellent background music to listen to. You also provide a small token of appreciation to the developers.  [h1] 🗃️ Side Notes: [/h1] Terraria is a challenging game for those who want to reach its completion. Before starting your adventure, I recommend you to get accustomed to terms like Pre-Hardmode - Hardmode mode etc. The game takes time to master, so do not get disappointed if you are struggling in the beginning. Be patient and most importantly have fun.  If you crave more challenges the [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/] tMoadLoader [/url] (available on Steam) will become your best friend, so why don’t you give it a try!!

It refers to all ages, as its unique gameplay encourages fun and creativity. You can build constructions, kill enemies, fight bosses, everything depends upon your playstyle.

Not to mention how much you can extend your experience with mods and special seeds (added by the developers) that fundamentally change the game.  On top of that, re-logic (the makers of terraria) just decided to support Godot and FNA to help out other game developers hopefully achieve a similar level of success that they did... a true class act.

Once you've made your character, you start off in the world of Terraria. Your first goal is survival. During the first day, you deal with pesky slimes while you gather the materials needed to build a shelter before nightfall. Once night comes, the undead swarm you. Are you resting safely in your new house, or are you forced to fight until daybreak?  If you thought slimes and undead were all you had to worry about in this world, you were wrong. Outlandish minions and deadly bosses await every turn, as you explore the many different environments in the world. Defeating them will reward you with new materials, weapons, armor, and even trophies to display.  Beware of the corruption, an environment native to Terraria, that slowly spreads, trying to shroud your world in darkness. Or, will your world contain the crimson? A festering landscape, oozing with blood and flesh that constantly tries to devour you. You will not be left defenceless against these horrors, however! You can work to purify the land to its original state.  In your travels, you will find resources that you can mine and gather. Combine them into powerful weapons and armor, or shape them into building blocks for new structures. As you grow and progress, NPCs will begin to flock to your buildings, offering you aid. You will even find some out in the world, waiting to be rescued.  Tunnel through the earth, or take wing and fly to the clouds. Purify or corrupt. Build or destroy.

The biggest problem with the game is you literally don't know what to do or how to progress in the game without looking up a guide on the Terraria Wiki, or by asking more experienced players. To me, I just find that as bad game design.  There could have been some sort of quest log that gave you some indication of what to do next, otherwise the beginning of the game becomes rather dull.  Moving on, once you do know what you are doing, the game becomes surprisingly more enjoyable as Terraria focuses on combat and boss encounters. Each boss is different from one another, and are actually challenging. The game limits you from getting better gear until a specific boss is defeated which keeps the challenge high throughout.  Apart from that, as you kill bosses new enemies and events will appear in the game unlocking a vast new variety of weapons, items, and equipment.   One thing I had not realized is the incredible amount of content Terraria offers. As soon as you think you are done with the game, it just keeps going with even more bosses, more grind for even better gear, and just so much new stuff as you go along. (be sure to keep checking the wiki to see what bosses are next and how to unlock them)   [b]It is very important that you play this game with a friend. Playing it solo is simply not as fun, especially considering the time investment.[/b]   General overview: + Loads of content + Fun combat system with a large variety of weapons, spells, and gear. + Lots of fantastic bosses + Very challenging + An ever-changing world with loads to explore + Great fun with friends + Very easy to host a server and game is very minimal on resources (meaning anyone with a PC can enjoy this, even on a laptop)  - Somewhat impossible to progress without a guide - The first half of the game is rather boring compared to the later half - A bit straining on the eyes with pixel graphics, especially with a high resolution monitor - A bit too challenging at times (especially playing solo) - Resources are limited, meaning you won't be able to get items without generating a new world (your character can move between worlds and servers)  [b]Highly recommend generating a medium to large world[/b]   To sum things up, Terraria is a fantastic game to play with at least one friend (preferably just 2-4 ). It offers an extremely high amount of content, lots of bosses, fun gameplay, lots to explore and craft, and its cheap!   +++ Highly recommend."

182716635,english,1,105600,"I started playing Terraria since around Dec 2011-12 on the Xbox 360 and 2015 on Windows. and I've got to say, this game is one of the best games I've ever played. there are hundreds of ways that you can play the game, (some of which I've haven't even done yet!) Many Youtubers like Yrimir, stampylonghead and ChippyGaming made my childhood back in those days. I've kind of played this for so long, it's almost like an addiction. (a good one except.)

77993818,english,1,105600,"My first ever Steam game. Boy was it a great 8 years, or however long it was. Sadly, the journey has come to an end. We all knew this was coming, after 1.3 came with the true endgame it was only a few years' time for the finale.  Back when I first joined, I was a little guy. Started playing back in the 1.1 days. I learned the ropes, and I had a lot of fun. Most of my time was occupied by another childhood favorite, Minecraft, however I played this quite often too. I found a server, and started playing some minigames, meeting people, and fighting bosses with them. Those times were great.  Then came 1.2, a glorious time. I started my first true playthrough, as a ranger, and was determined to beat the Golem, which I did after some time. I ended up painting my entire spawn in negative colors because I was bored. Those were also fun times.  After that came 1.3, the endgame. I wasn't playing it much during this time, due to not being able to use a computer, but I played it and it was enjoyable nonetheless. I met more people, played more games, did more playthroughs, and I ended up getting into mods.  But eventually, things go as they come.  1.4 is a bittersweet update, to say the least. It made the game look so much better, and performed smoother overall too. The changes added were astronomical, but nothing truly game-changing, well except for Empress of Light. The new Master mode is okay, but it lost so much potential it could have had. x10 spawnrate is also fun, but I only put some 40 hours into that. Got pretty far, but it just got too strenuous, with school starting up and all too.  A game I once knew to be simply three mechanical bosses and some hallowed gear changed into the vibrant landscape it is today, but never to change anymore. It's one of many relics lost to time of my childhood, and one that will go in my mind as a great memory collection, yet not to be added to much more. I might play this game here and there, but it just isn't what it used to be.  May I wish you all good luck in your virtues, and hope you all have a great time, as I once did. Just don't get it get to your heart too much, otherwise it will pull hard."

150159381,english,1,105600,"I wanted to write this review after I spent enough time in the game and have gotten most of the achievements. So now that I’m about 109/115 achievements & 100 hours playtime, I feel I can finally give an adequate review.   I felt this game was hard to get into at the beginning but if you have someone help you through the first steps in learning the game play and crafting mechanics, it gets easier and more fun. It’s hard because at the start, you basically are some weak homeless dude and have to fight off slimes, collect and craft, materials build your own house before it gets dark (and pretty much do this for the entirety of the game but as you progress, you get to upgrade your gear and it gets easier). It sounds like a grind but it’s well-worth it. It’s somewhat satisfying to build yourself up from the beginning, from wood walls to the solar or vortex brick or something.   The coolest part of the game is the crafting and building aspects of it. There’s so many different types of materials, which you can make into various styles of brick or wall paper, even furniture (like balloon furniture). There’s so much customizability in how you can build your houses. There’s different environments or “biomes” so you build houses that are befitting of that specific biome and then you get NPC’s to move in. You can also collect weird paintings which you can decorate your houses with.    There’s different game modes too so if you want a challenge, you can play hardcore or if you just want to build, you can do journey mode which allows you to duplicate items so you don’t have to destroy your world mining it all. It’s one of those games where there’s no right way to play. Play how you want and play how you think is most fun.  The music and the scenery in the game is also very pleasant, so it’s a very nice chill relax game. It’s nice solo and coop. 10/10 would recommend.  [b]In brief, here's some aspects I loved about it:[/b]  [list]     [*] environment & character customization     [*] crafting, collecting, and building     [*] open world exploration of different scenic environments     [*] soundtrack (that corresponds with the biome)      [*] different game modes and difficulties     [*] adorable creatures throughout the biomes  [/list]   Notice, I didn't mention combat in my review. Eh, it's not my type of game combat wise but that's the beauty of this game. There's different game modes where you can choose what type of experience you want from the game. Some go for those hardcore challenge runs and I go for Journey mode because I love the buidling and crafting elements."
71027789,english,1,105600,What could I possibly say? You don't spend 900 hours in a 10 dollar game if it sucks.
51279217,english,1,105600,"Terraria is one of the top rated games on steam. And honestly, it deserves it. I think this is a damn good game. I won’t say it’s a perfect game and there are certainly some things you should know before you buy it, but I will happily give it a recommend.  [u]Let Me Begin with What the Game is About and What Makes it Cool.[/u] You start out with a basic sword, axe, and pickaxe, in the middle of nowhere. You’re first step is to get wood and build a shelter to protect you from the zombies at night. Next you need to dig down and get ore to make better gear. So it’s 2d minecraft? Well it’s more than that, let me continue. You’ll need decent armor and weapons to fight the tougher monsters that live underground and to fight bosses.   Yep bosses. Bosses are one of the defining elements of this game. Bosses are big and imposing and they play this awesome adrenaline music when you summon them (a lot of the Terraria music is awesome btw). And there’s a huge variety of bosses too: There’s a floating eye that aggressively charges at you, there’s a big worm creature that breaks into smaller worms as you damage it, there’s an angry plant that can only be fought in the claustrophobic jungle, there’s a cult leader that summons mirages of itself and makes the game into a bullet hell with how many projectiles it spits out. Now bosses can be very punishing, but this is a building/crafting game, so you can build your own arena with platforms to jump on and walls to protect you from (some) attacks, or craft potions that boost your speed, health regen, armor, and damage. The fact that you can tackle bosses on your own terms in your own arena is one of the most interesting parts of the game and it really makes boss fights feel epic.   Killing bosses is the main way you progress through the game. Killing them gives you some kickass loot or lets you access a parts of the world where you can discover some more kickass loot. There’s a lot of loot in this game. And it’s some pretty cool loot too. You get staffs that call meteors down from the sky, fireball staffs, swords that shoot fireballs, machine guns, rocket launchers, different kinds of ammo to go in your guns, yo-yo’s (yo-yos are a really cool weapon), boomerangs, tools that summon monsters or turrets to fight for you, tools that let you jump real high (useful for dodging boss attacks), vehicles that let you move real fast, grappling hooks for going spelunking. The more bosses you kill and the further you progress, the more powerful and interesting the loot you get. Seriously, getting new loot just feels absolutely wonderful in this game.  So yeah, I would say mining, boss fighting, and collecting loot are the meat of the game, but there’s plenty of gravy too. Maybe you want to take a break from boss fighting and do some fishing so you can get a chainsaw fish and also some potion ingredients. Well then you probably want to create a few ponds throughout your world. And you’ll probably want to set up some minecart tracks or teleporters to get to your ponds quickly. Or maybe you want to set up a mushroom farm because mushroom are good for potions as well as crafting some late game armor. Well you’ll want to create several rows of dirt so the mushrooms have plenty of surface area to spawn on. And if you don’t want to harvest mushrooms manually you can set up a bunch of conveyor belts and wire so the mushrooms just fall down and come to you. Or maybe a part of your world is corrupt. Corruption spreads slowly so you may want to dig a trench around it to keep it quarantined, or you can buy a special gun that cleanses corruption outright. Or maybe you need a bunch of unicorn horns. You could go to the part of the world where unicorns spawn and kill them with your flaming yo-yo. Or you could dig a big pit and every time a unicorn come by it falls into the pit and dies because the pit is full of lava and spiky traps. This is a crafting game where enemies are just another crafting resource, so setting up a death pit to farm unicorns is a logical thing to do. There’s plenty of stuff to do in Terraria and plenty of ways to do it.   [u]And Now for the Parts of the Game You Might Not Find so Cool.[/u] First of all, the difficulty. Specifically, the bosses. Bosses will kill you. Bosses are tough. You can give yourself boosts with potions and armor, but dodging attacks is your best bet. And that can be very difficult when the boss charges rapidly at you or shoots a dozen balls of lightning at you. You will need to learn the attack patterns of bosses and you will need to train your reflexes. I mentioned bullet hell earlier, and I really do think this game has bullet hell elements. If you just can’t stand bullet hell games you probably want to avoid Terraria. (Since difficulty is a pretty subjective thing, you may want to look up a video review of Terraria and see some boss fights and combat for yourself.)  Another thing I want to mention is the sheer amount of stuff to learn. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Terraria wiki. It’s a crafting game, so you’ll need to look up crafting recipes as well as how to get ingredients. It’s also a game about fighting giant bosses, so you’ll need to know how to summon bosses and you’ll probably want to read some tips on making an arena. If you want to build a garden or fishing pond you’ll want to know when certain herbs bloom and how much water to put in your pond. For building more complex structures, you may want to look up tutorials on youtube (the game has gone through several updates though, so some youtube tutorials are out of date). Personally, I kinda enjoyed learning the game. I’d get some weird item in my inventory and immediately going to the wiki to see what I could do with it. But I realize not everyone wants to study a wiki while they play video games.   One of the interesting parts of the game is how it’s a building/fighting hybrid kind of game. And while that’s cool some of the time, it can be really annoying at other times. Say you’re underground building an arena to fight a boss, then a bat flies out at you, now you have to stop building and take out your weapon. So you kill the bat and try to get back to building, but another bat spawns and you have to kill that one too. The game literally has a formula where if it detects there aren’t any enemies near you it will spawn new enemies, so you will constantly have to fight off annoying enemies while you’re trying to build or mine. (I should mention that there are tools that help deal with enemy harassment, but you need to know how to get them, which reinforces my point that you need to read the wiki)   I don’t really like Terraria’s endgame. Most of the early and midgame consists of exploring, building, and crafting, with the occasional action-packed boss fight thrown in, which I like because it offers some nice variety. However the endgame is back-to-back combat. Fight a boss, then fight a bunch of minibosses, then fight another boss, then fight four living towers which spawn very fast very dangerous enemies, then fight another boss. For my first playthrough of this game I stopped playing when I got to the endgame because I just didn’t want to slog through all the fighting. Now, I actually like the combat and I liked fighting bosses throughout the game, but it’s a simple combat system and fighting loses some of its charm when you do it for too long.   So this review turned out longer than I expected. I guess I wanted to be thorough. When I first played this game I got pretty frustrated at times and I was prepared to toss out the game altogether. But then I got into it a bit more and learned the mechanics better and I actually really liked it. Despite its flaws, this is probably one of my favorite games ever."

67608782,english,1,105600,"Absolute classic. Whenever I play it feels like I'm progressing whether it be getting a new weapon, killing a boss or just building a really nice house for an NPC it always feels like I'm moving forward. Surprisingly, the game hasn't really seemed to show any signs of its age despite being almost 9 years old at this point. The music is fantastic especially during boss fights. Boss fights have a perfect challenge level when you do them with the intended gear and there are a whole lot of bosses to fight throughout the game. The game has a ""halfway point"" just when you start to feel established which really puts you back on your toes and creates an excellent dynamic without taking anything away from the player. Expert mode feels like a perfect challenge for people who have a lot of experience by adding new mechanics or just small buffs to each boss. Overall one of my favourite games of all time."
77589421,english,1,105600,"Not much to say, everyone knows this game, everyone loves this game. 9 years of free updates is unprecedented and the developers are top tier for sticking with community this long.

83377962,english,1,105600,"[spoiler]Since I don't know English very well, I apologize for my mistakes.[/spoiler]  Most likely, my review will remain in the shadows, and hardly anyone will reach the end of my review, I still want to share with you my feelings and the seasoned spirit of adventure. It all started many years ago, when I got acquainted with one of the most wonderful, warm, and memorable games in my life - Terraria. When pronouncing this word, I immediately feel warm in my soul, I remember the wonderful soundtrack and completely immerse myself in my thoughts. Before reviewing, I immediately want to note that this game gave me a new perception of computer games, and gave me a great childhood.  I myself am not an ordinary player in Terraria, and there are few such oldies, because I got acquainted with Terraria even before its release, or more precisely, before the official release of the game on Steam (May 16, 2011). And although I have played 200 hours of this game in my Steam, I actually played it for about 1000 hours. When I was little, I, like all children, played Minecraft, and I really liked this game, I thought that I could not find a better game. But one fine day, my dad came home from work and told me about Terraria, which just appeared. Another employee told Dad about the game, and another employee told this employee, and then I don't know the story of the spread of rumors about a brand new freshly baked Terraria. When I first started the game, I created my character, spending several hours on it, pressed the button to create a world, and found myself on the ground. Someone walked next to me, his name was Guide, who first fell into the abyss ... I don't know why he did it, but it didn't really bother me. The first thing I learned was how to walk, jump and dig, and it was incredibly fun! After that I dug a hole for myself, buried myself on top and went to play Minecraft ... Don't judge strictly, but for a child then Minecraft was much more colorful, and had a 3D view, and not a cropped 3D space along the Z axis. But a couple of days later I went back in into the game, and again continued to explore the world, the game did not cause as much enthusiasm for me as many people who have started playing quite recently. And I don't know if it's good that I started playing such a raw game. But as time went on, I studied the world of Terraria more and more. I got to know cute teardrop-mongers and creatures that were constantly killing me. I realized that I needed a home to live, and that's when I discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of all the games I've played - building. So I gave up traveling and started BUILDING and DIGGING! And then this game completely sucked me in. I quit Minecraft and started DIGGING, KILLING, AND EXPLORING. I met new residents who can SELL! And a nurse who can CHOOSE! I also realized that the Guide is not a useless piece of garbage, and that you can have a heart-to-heart talk with him. In the end, I killed the ominous Eye of Cthulhu, which sowed fear, and the game ended there ... But soon new updates came out, I downloaded new versions and went all over again. And it was interesting. I went through each update, and did not get a mental pleasure. Since I like everything more difficult, I started playing the game on the Expert Advisor, and later on the Master. But all this was not enough for me! And I started to go through mods, for those who know Calamity mod, I went through this game with Revenge and Death modes, and also after a few hundred attempts I went through Boss Rush. Then I lost my nerves.  With each update, the game brought new emotions and a colorful world to the players and me. Every progress you make is much more satisfying than the last one and continues to push you forward, to the point where you don't stop. There is no point in talking about old versions, so I'll tell you a couple (hundreds) of words about the new Terraria.  For me this game became a home in which I felt comfortable. The game is currently in the game about 500 varieties of mobs. There are also 19 bosses and 13 mini-bosses, as well as 3 additional bosses in the mobile version. And from listing recipes you can break your tongue. Sloped blocks, paints, different walls were added to the game, each block merged together, each block interacted with other blocks. Light sources, different platforms that you may have used. All of this and more meant that anything imaginable could be built. Many people create amazing mechanisms and worlds, better than on paper!) Although they made a convenient interface for creating my character in the game, I also devote a lot of time to creating a character). And the music and style of play makes me crazy. I bought this game for my every account, and made all my friends, no matter if it was voluntary, to purchase this masterpiece. And if you are thinking whether to buy this game, I can hardly answer you ... YES !!! This game is amazing both solo and when playing with friends! You can catch hares and then fill the whole world of your friend with them! It's worth buying for this!  I can confidently say that Terraria has become my corner of safety, this is my home, there is no place easier and quieter than it.  Thanks Andrew Spinks, Whitney Spinks ❤ Thanks Re-Logic ❤ Thanks Terraria ❤ Thanks for reading ❤"

105945973,english,1,105600,"The amount of labor, love, and time that the developers have spent fine-tuning and improving this game is truly astounding. With over 5000 items, 28 bosses and minibosses, easy multiplayer access, and mod support all wrapped up into a $10 bundle with no extra microtransactions or DLC, Terraria is a masterpiece that large-scale game companies could only dream of making. A single playthrough can easily last you over 30+ hours, for most, that is barely the tip of the iceberg.  This is a game that you can play and replay multiple times and still discover new items and mechanics with each playthrough. Every new world is a new adventure, a new place for creativity, an escape from reality to let your inner imagination run loose. Nothing pushes or pressures you to rush through the game, it is a self-paced journey that, despite the many labels put onto it, has no real end. Some people play the game to find new items and accessories, others play to build the ideas that live in their minds, but no matter how you decide to play the game, there is something for everyone to enjoy. Relogic called the 1.4 update “Journey’s End,” but I think that, even now, it is just the beginning.  In addition to all of this, the multiplayer in this game is absolutely phenomenal. Playing, chatting, and enjoying the game with friends is an incredible experience*. The pacing of the game barely changes compared to single-player and the atmosphere and ideas that can run through your world can be incredible. Access to the steam workshop, a place where you can share your creations or see the creations of others, is also a great addition to the game**.   Unfortunately, no game can be perfect in every way, I do have a few minor issues with the game.  RNG: Most items in Terraria are commonly available throughout the game. However, a very select few are very Rng dependent and can often feel like a chore to grind for. Fortunately, most of these items are entirely optional such as the information accessories and some late-game boss drops. Summoner Class: There are 4 main fighting classes in the game, Melee, Ranger, Mage, and Summoner. The latter is a unique class that uses minions to fight for you. This is a fantastic concept, but it is very poorly executed due to the lack of variety of summoner weapons and armor. Master Mode is a new difficulty in Terraria that was added in the 1.4 update, which increases the difficulty of the game by tripling the monster’s health and damage… that’s it. Other than a few extra cosmetic items, Master Mode is simply Expert Mode but with more enemy health. It doesn’t add anything new or interesting so it is usually best to just avoid it unless you are into that type of gameplay.  These are very minor flaws with the game and absolutely do not impact the overall gameplay or enjoyability at all. Terraria is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have had, the time I spent playing by myself and friends during the lockdown was definitely time well spent. If you are someone who enjoys building games, combat of all types, exploration, or just want a game that is a mixture of all of these, then I definitely recommend buying this game. If Relogic had made the updates cost money, then I absolutely would have paid, and the fact that they continue to add free updates to this game 10 years after its release just goes to show how much they care about their player and fanbase, and that is absolutely something I am willing to support.   * If you plan to start a multiplayer world with more than two people, I highly recommend playing on an expert mode world because of the modified boss drops. If you play on a normal world, then you will get boss drops equivalent to the boss drops of single-player, whereas an expert world’s boss drops are equivalent to the number of players on the world.   ** Terraria also has fantastic mod support, with the developers at Relogic just recently updating TModLoader to 1.4, and though I have never played modded Terraria, I have heard fantastic things about all kinds of community creations.   TL;DR  Good game, you should buy"

112310637,english,1,105600,"As someone who's over 1800 hours in, I can tell you with confidence that this game is a MASTERPIECE.  There are A LOT of things I could say about Terraria, but put quite simply: it's worth every penny.  The bosses are a blast, each class is fun in their own unique way, Expert difficulty is perfection (Normal is too easy and you get less loot; don't ever play on Normal), even the NPCs all have their uses!  Technically speaking, an NPC is only ever useless depending on your class or personal preference (e.g. some people may not care for the Angler achievements, or a mage might not care for the Arms Dealer, etc.).  You will always have something to do, at pretty much any given point in the game.  And even when you've 'beaten' the game and gotten bored of your world, you could just make a new character, new world, and have a totally new experience!  Then, even if you get bored of that, you can download tModloader for FREE, and mod the game to your hearts' content!  It's affordable, can run on most hardware, and is, dare-I-say, the perfect gaming experience.  I can't recommend this game enough."

It is simplistic enough to jump right into and yet at the same time, complex enough to keep one playing for years and years. The three pillars of the game are Building, Fighting, and Exploring. You have your own little (or not so little) world that is chock full of loot enemies and unique environments for you to kill and build yourself while doing the same to your planet. Good enemies: as varied as the freckle patterns on a persons face fun loot: There are six buttloads of stuff to shoot, slash, equip, or throw. (or explode) Blocks: for the crafty, theres a bunch of different blocks... (like if you though minecraft had a lot of blocks...) Bosses: you keep thinking how am I ever gonna be strong enough to beat that. (then you get strong enough and theres another)  all in all I highly recommend this game. its awesome. 10/10 would (will) definitely play again"

71383430,english,1,105600,"I would like to start off this review by saying one thing. This is one of the best games ever made. Now, most people would probably look at this game and think it's just 2D Minecraft, but it is so much more than that. The main similarities are in the blocks and survival aspects of it. But beyond that Terraria is just so much more.  Summary:  Gameplay - [9] When you start a world for the first time it is a very slow game, but the game quickly picks up the pace. There is no hand-holding in this game whatsoever, you have to do everything yourself or check the Terraria wiki page. You change a lot during your adventure and in the end the game is very fast-paced.  Soundtrack - [10] The soundtrack is some of the best I've ever heard in a sandbox game. It's so simplistic yet so good. It is very catchy and I will never forget the iconic song Overworld Day which is instantly recognized.  Graphics - [10] Since it isn't aiming for realistic graphics you really cannot give it a bad score. It's a very specific kind of art style that fits the game very well.  Price - [10] The price is incredibly cheap compared to what you get. You get a really long game with a bunch of replay value. It costs 9,99€ on Steam but often goes down to 4.99€ during sales. It's a great price.  In conclusion: Terraria is a fantastic game that has everything you would ever want in a game like this. You should really buy this if you want a really good sandbox game. The developers have been supporting this game for years now and still have 1 last update left called Journey's End. Thanks for reading this review."

143104076,english,1,105600,"There is currently NO 2D game that compares to Terraria.  I have spent 80 hours in this game and still feel like an absolute beginner.

If your looking for a 2D game to get invested in, this is it. This gave has everything from  - bosses   - player made houses  - currency system  - EXTREMELY well thought out game progression (EXTREMELY)  - multiplayer  - mass amount of weapons and items  - very appealing graphics  - easy controls  - achievements and so much more.

18435281,english,1,105600,"Alright so I've been playing this game ever since 1.0.4, building stuff, killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming, so it's about time I should actually make a review on this game. I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.  Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.  But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts)."
21906575,english,1,105600,"When I first saw my friend playing Terraria, I thought it was a 2d MineCraft.

64747184,english,1,105600,"For everyone saying this is a 2D Minecraft, you're wrong. This game has a lot of stuff to offer. Different kind of bosses, unique items, an adventure u WILL NEVER forget, Terraria."
38067494,english,1,105600,"This is one of the best games ever made and the only reason it is not regarded as such is that it is not very accessible. I can imagine many critics have started Terraria, played for some hours trying to figure it out, and put it away. Very often, critics have drawn misguided conclusions that Terraria resembles Minecraft (or is a Minecraft clone), but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Terraria is a procedurally generated sandbox survival metroidvania. Learning curve is steep, the game is hard and often requires you to consult to wikis and guides (even more so than the Souls series) but once you gain control of the game mechanics, you will find a very deep, hard core gem. Don’t let its eye-candy graphics fool you…  You are dropped into a world surrounded by many dangers. Initially, you are expected to make your first shelter, first weapon and just survive. This is the very core of the whole game. In order to beat stronger creatures, you need better weapons for which you need better crafting material. To get better crafting material, you need to mine deep into the earth, which leads you to find secret chests, face gazillion creatures including “bosses”. Boss fights not only require skill, but also need you to have the weapons, armors, potions, items necessary to beat them. Last, but not the least, there are plenty of events such as Halloween, Christmas, Pirate Invasion etc. with their own unique bosses and loots.  While you are working on mining for better tools, armors, weapons to be able to beat stronger enemies, you also need to keep expanding your “shelter”. A chair, ceiling and door is not sufficient any longer. You need to keep building new rooms to have room for new crafting centers and chests (for inventory). Every new room invites a new NPC to your shelter who can be crucial in your quest to beat the world of terraria, whether they sell unique items or provide healing.  Being a true sandbox game, you can also ignore progression and spend hundreds of hours just building. Your limit to what you can build and how you can customize it is your imagination. People at Terraria subreddit still manage to amaze me with their creativity and sometimes totally mind-blowing architecture.   Whether you choose to play it as a metroidvania or as a sandbox 2d Minecraft, you will love Terraria. In my opinion, it is one of the best games ever made.  [b]PS:[/b] Buy it full price. Developers are still updating content and supporting the game after all these years (without any paid DLCs whatsoever), they really deserve some support.  [b]10/10[/b]"

7877530,english,1,105600,"Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the ""crafting"" genre seriously. These were my first impressions.  However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!).   The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!  There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!  Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).  If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years)."
2092948,english,1,105600,"Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft. And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends."
57972609,english,1,105600,"""omG iTs jUsT 2dEE mInEcRafT!"" is the only thing I hear as a Terraria player, and I have to say that that is completely and utterly wrong. The game is great once you get into it but I think the reason it is so underrated is because the beginning of the game is a bit lacking. People just start up a world, chop down a tree or die to a slime or something and get bored. With Terraria you have to be patient. The game is difficult and a bit unforgiving at times but with the sheer amount of places to explore and items to find I personally think it's an amazing game. The best part about the game in my opinion is the music. I unironically listen to Terraria music sometimes it's that good. Anyway, I'm gunna go play some Terraria now. Bye!"
32842453,english,1,105600,"Lets get into it shall we   Terraria, the game that makes you question your life choices more than a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book on existentialism. I've spent more time in this pixelated wonderland than I have in the real world, and let me tell you, I regret nothing. My therapist might disagree, but what does she know about the joys of defeating pixelated bosses and building houses for NPCs who can't even say ""thank you""?  With over 1200 hours logged, I can confidently say that Terraria is not just a game; it's a way of life. Forget sunshine and fresh air; I've got mushrooms and glowing ore to keep me company. Who needs friends when you have a loyal army of NPCs, each with their unique quirks and questionable fashion sense?  The variety in this game is mind-boggling. I mean, where else can you go from fighting a gigantic eye to crafting a rainbow gun that shoots unicorns? It's like a fever dream mixed with a dash of pure, unadulterated awesomeness. Terraria is the only place where you can go from feeling like a badass ninja to a master chef whipping up delicacies for your digital neighbors.  Speaking of neighbors, those NPCs are a special bunch. They move in, mooch off your hospitality, and somehow manage to get themselves killed by zombies every other night. It's like living in a retirement home for video game characters, and I love it. Who wouldn't want a nurse, a wizard, and a gun-slinging arms dealer as roommates?  The building aspect of Terraria is like playing with virtual Legos, only better. Sure, you could build a modest little house, but why stop there when you can create a floating island with a disco floor and lava waterfalls? My creativity knows no bounds, and neither does the game's ability to let me indulge in my architectural fantasies.  Terraria is the only game that has me questioning whether I've been spending too much time in the real world. Why go outside when I can explore the vast reaches of the underworld, battle mythical beasts, and collect rare artifacts? The real world doesn't have pixelated penguins, and that's a deal-breaker for me.  In conclusion, Terraria is not just a game; it's a lifestyle. I highly recommend it to anyone who values creativity, exploration, and the ability to ignore real-world responsibilities. With 1200+ hours under my belt, I can confidently say that Terraria is the reason my plants are dead, my dog is hungry, and my social life is practically nonexistent. And you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. Five stars, two thumbs up, and a digital high five to the developers for creating this masterpiece. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dungeon to raid and a virtual pet to feed."

It's a thrilling sandbox adventure with mostly linear progression, tons of content, and lots of replayability. They keep updating it every once in a while, and content-focused mods can elevate the experience even more. Like some games of its era, it can be a bit tough to get into without looking at the wiki a little bit. That's part of the experience, imo."

In the beginning, farming wood and my first ore the game felt kinda slow, but once I looted some chests in the underground bioms and got some movement items for faster running or double jumps I was hooked for it. I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun.   I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime.   Do I recommend this game? Yes! Absolutely!

42230477,english,1,105600,"People always love to make the comparision of Terraria and Minecraft. If you ever played this game, you'll know that they shouldn't be compared. In fact, for a single player experience, i'd say Terraria beats Minecraft hands down. But this isn't about Minecraft, so i'll list a few things as to why Terraria is great. Terraria is for those who love the idea of growing and becoming stronger the more you play. In the beginning, you're pretty much helpless, killing the weakest enemies in multiple hits. You move slugglishly, and minor heights and caverns are truly intimidating. In the end, you are a force to be reckoned with, capable of taking down hoards of enemy after enemy mithout even pressing a button - diving to the deepest parts of the world and traversing every terrain with ease.  The change is gradual, and each challenge is tougher than the last. But if you're up for the grind - and its a fun one at that - then Terraria is for you."
49808465,english,1,105600,"At first, this game may seem babyish: with an axe swinging all the way around and a sword looking little less than a porridge stirrer. You have a world, you can flourish and prosper but it is also a dangerous, hostile and menacing environment.   You create your first house: with a chair, table, walls and a background made from supposedly wood.  You create your armour and a new sword and you set of in your quest for salvation. Later on, you gear up; and fight your first boss.   It gets harder over time and you have more and more responsibilities to keep your world on its feet, and don't let the bad thing happen..."
88734962,english,1,105600,"Terraria: Sand Is Overpowered  - Graphics :   2-D vibrant graphics with block-like textures and a ""washed"" look. No HD, ultra-high settings. Just plain old sprites with 2-D.    - Sound :   Electric-type soundtrack. It's a bit unique since it sounds completely original and could almost be classified as something new. Soundtrack aside, all of the items and enemies and humans sound believable. Laser guns have a laser sound, a slime enemy makes a jello sound when it's killed, the player will emit a pain sound when attacked. Again, nothing weird or out of the ordinary since it's a pretty simple concept.    - Gameplay :   2-D sidescrolling, using the WASD keys to move up, down, left and right. Since it's a sandbox game, there's lots of things to create. You will primarily be mining the blocks that compose the entire Terraria world you create in order to make items like armor and weapons or buildings. PVP is also included, but is restricted to online server use. There are bosses to defeat, NPCs to find, thousands of items to create or collect, miles upon miles of caverns to explore beneath the ground, and of course sky islands to explore. There is water, lava and honey. Terraria is all about exploring and combat, with creation being a minor, but still vital, part of the game."
41478867,english,1,105600,"A game developed and published by Re-Logic.  Terraria, an interesting title, where your imagination determines how far you can progress, and how much time you will pour into this game. A hollow world till you arrive, teeming with precious ores, and dark secrets. Fetid swamps and dry deserts.  This game is definitely an endeavour, and it will soak up alot of your time as you try and reach the pinnacle of your characters limitations and how much you can construct. Often remarked as a ""2D Minecraft"" I always find this comparison woefully incorrect. Minecraft has a wide selection of enemies, which is similar, A wide array of ore and precious gems to mine, which is also similar. But from then one, Terraria leaves it dead in the water. An RPG experience, with substantial boss progression, Active try and retry game mechanics and spanning character classes, All inclusive of a massive crafting system, and wide assortment of things to collect and try.  Anyways, I've praised it enough, lets get down to the review!  Graphics: Probably one of the weaker points of the game, Its still very vibrant and holds upto despite its 2011, Birthdate. This is mainly due to the pixelated graphics and 2D perspective of the game. Not alot to render, and not alot to process at any one time, Making it run very smoothly at any point in time, But also extremely limited due to there not being any sort of graphical options or benchmarks.  Gameplay: Where do i begin. This game plays, as well as you can play it. All the mechanics are there for you to make it work in your favor. But finding your niche and finding your work space is all crucial in you enjoying your time in Terraria. The game drops you into a world, where you basically don't understand anything, A very limited spread of understanding, very few tools at your disposal, and a single NPC to help guide you along your journey. 4 classes to basically choose from as you progress through the game, Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. All depending on how you want to play and how you prefer to play. Despite there being no relevant story or backstory to this game, there is a substantial amount of progression and ALOT of gear to rummage around for.  Story: I think i pretty much covered this aspect of the game already. There really isn't a story here. Which is usually a game killer for me. I heavily invest in story driven worlds, And this world has none to speak of. I guess the story can be made up for each player, as to why you are doing what you're doing, but as for a story driven narrative. There isn't one.  I don't often do a ""CONS"" section. But this game is so monstrous in terms of scope and size, I feel it's necessary to provide as much information as possible. I love this game to bits, this is perhaps the 3rd time i've played it through, Once on playstation, once on Xbox and now on PC. So i'm well aware of his rather frustrating flaws. So here we are.... Cons: This game despite how much effort has been poured into it, Has rather sizable and numerous flaws. Mostly relating around achievement glitches, game crashing and multiplayer bugs. Achievement glitches are fairly frustrating, although are entirely not a concern unless you're as OCD as i am. The game progresses the same way regardless of steams registering of your progress. Game crashes for alot of players at certain intervals in the game, Which HAS caused loss of character saves. It's highly recommended that you cloud save your favorite character builds and worlds, so that your save data will always be present. And Multiplayer as a whole is a fairly awful experience, the above mention bugs as well as an assortment of new things, Players not seeing what each other are seeing, Enemies and bosses despawning because of numerous players involved, which may or may not potentially ruin hours upon hours of preparation and planning. Frustrating to say the least. But alot of it is avoidable if you take necessary precautions. Alot of which can be found through quick internet searches.  Overall: This game is a gigantic time suck lol There is no other way to put it, You will pour time into boss by boss progression, farming and grinding enemies for specific gear to better improve your chances at the next boss. You will dig deep into dirt, mud and ash for hours upon hours just to find 3 pieces of ore which isn't even close to the amount you need. You will kill thousands of enemies for a single piece of gear, that isn't even optimal till you find another piece it can be fused with. You will die on the inside for days and potentially weeks as you farm your way to the very end of the game. And then when it's all over and you finally can get a breath of respite as your real life world is crumbling to pieces around you, You will feel empty, knowing that it's done. This game isn't just worth its price, It's worth every minute you pour into it. Welcome to Terraria. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do."
26677395,english,1,105600,"This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.  I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.  Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.  Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do.   There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!  Now this Game might not have the best ""graphics"" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way.   I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low! So just give it a shot!"
136258986,english,1,105600,"I intitially lost my progress twice, I just looked at the store page and seen ""steam cloud"" support and didn't think I need to do anything to keep my progress safe. On the character/world selection page there are options ""play, favourite, move to cloud, rename"" just so you don't repeat my mistake pick move to cloud for world and characters you care about.  Besides that It's a fun game, once you get a basic hang of it. Learn how to build a house, move around the map fast, craft, find/summon bosses and you're good to go.   You can do as much or as little in this game as you want, you can challenge yourself with different world/character level of difficulties, there's also a journey mode that offers god mode/time manipulation/ítem duplication, It's basically a creative mode.   This game is a sandbox title with no story so play however you see fit.   This game has a lot to offer and despite putting in almost 100 hrs I feel like I still have a long way to go.  Reccomended to people looking for an addictive time sink game."
36450210,english,1,105600,If your focus is on gameplay rather than on graphics then this game is for you. If you want a cool game and not a mind fucking shit then this game is for you. If you are a creative person and dont like spoon feeding then this game is for you. If you like adventures and explorations rather than instant actions then this game is for you. If you like a value for money game and dont want to spend a big amount then this game is for you. If you like killing zombies and monsters with your own made weapons then this game is for you. If you want to play on your old laptop and cant afford heavy rig then this game is for you. If you want to make a world of your own then this game is for you.

[*] The soundtrack is good. [*] The bosses are challenging. [*] The almost endless things to do in this game. [*] It takes a long time to complete the game. [/list] [b] 👎Cons: [/b] [list] [*] It’s very hard to learn at first. [*] Playing this game can easily leave you lost on how to move forward. [/list] [hr][/hr][h2] 🎮Gameplay: [/h2][hr][/hr] Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with a focus on exploration, building, crafting, combat, survival, and mining, which is playable both in singleplayer and multiplayer modes.   The player begins in a randomly generated world with only basic tools to progress. In order to craft better tools, the player will need to mine the starter ores, such as iron and tin. As you gather these resources, you can build a house to protect yourself and make better tools and armor to fight the monsters that spawn at night.  Also, you should be searching for life crystals if you want to increase your max health, and you should be searching for fallen stars if you want to increase your max mana. Mana is the ""ammo"" you need for your magic wands and items that need mana.  Once you have built a house, you need to build houses for the NPCs to live in. The NPCs can sell you useful items for the money you receive from defeating enemies. There is also a guide NPC who can give you hints on what to do. You can also find NPCs around the world who need help, and when you help them, they can move into your house.   It is time to explore the world and go deep into the mines to find better ores, but be aware because there are traps and strong enemies in the mines. If you don't have the appropriate pickaxe, you won't be able to mine all the ores at first. As well as the mines, you will have to go through the different biomes you will find in the game. Both are generated randomly.  Various world events may occur that make the enemies stronger, such as the blood moon, slime rain, etc. These events usually happen at night.   By destroying a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart, a meteor will fall in your world, which you can mine to craft some useful items.  You can do a lot in Terraria whether you're bored or not. You can start a building project or do side missions that NPCs give you, etc. The game does not require much grinding, but it takes a while to mine enough ores.  I think that much of the game should be discovered by the players themselves, so I'll leave you with just this and hope that you'll want to get into this awesome 2D game called Terraria.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌲Biomes: [/h2][hr][/hr] There are several different biomes in the game, including the snow biome, jungle, desert, and more. There are also biomes underground that have secrets to be discovered. I won't tell you much about the biomes since exploring is part of the game, but I will say that the biomes are well designed and interesting to explore. In the mines, you will find chests with loot that could be very useful.   [hr][/hr][h2] 📄🎩Bosses and some facts: [/h2][hr][/hr] I won't tell you about the boss's abilities and such, because I think you should discover that for yourself as you progress.   The bosses spawn when you have the right item and do a certain action with it, such as throwing it into lava or clicking on it. You can also summon bosses by speaking with some NPCs. Different areas have their own bosses to face. The bosses are well thought out, and the difficult ones are the ones near the end of the game so you don't just defeat them all with the bad loot and complete the game with that. Prepare yourself with potions and good equipment if you are going to take on one of these bosses.  To progress in the game, you must defeat the bosses, because that will result in you getting more items and unlocking things in your world that you couldn't do before. This is a 16-bit style game, and I think it suits the game well.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌎👕Options of your world and character customization: [/h2][hr][/hr] It is possible to change some stuff in your Terraria world such as the seed, the size, difficulty. You can also decide if there will be corruption or crimson in your world.  Various customization options are also available, including clothing and clothing colors, hairstyles, eye colors, and more.   [hr][/hr][h2] 💭Final Thoughts: [/h2][hr][/hr] If you're looking for something to play for a while and you want to always have something to do, then Terraria is the game for you. It has an excellent soundtrack and great features. The bosses are challenging, and the game takes a long time to complete. Overall, the game is excellent.   Rating: 8/10"

34867907,english,1,105600,"I've put lots of time into this game, even before I bought it on Steam. When I did finally get it on Steam, I purchased two copies: one for myself, and one for my wife. We played together, helping each other collect health and mana upgrades, equipment upgrades, and collecting the NPCs. She fought off slimes and zombies while I established gardens for mushrooms, trees, and plants for potion ingredients. We mined, we explored dungeons and caves, we fought bosses and discovered how to navigate Hell.  It's been an amazing time, and this game has been well worth the amount of money I've spent on it. I've gotten more hours of enjoyment out of it, both alone and with my wife, than I have with nearly every $60 AAA game. The music, the graphics, the controls, and the amount of stuff available to do just make it an easy recommendation for me."

Also I kinda had to update this review a little bit, minor fixing on my writing and maybe adding some more stuff for my story part.)  Terraria...  It's been over 9 years since it has been released on steam and perhaps still over 9 years since I got my hands on this pure gem.  When I first time saw this as pretty foolish person and thinking this being just ""2D Minecraft"" but thankfully I was completely wrong about it and getting really into this game.  Sure your first time playing this game might be so slow and boring, but once you get your hands on very interesting gears and meet very important people that sells even much more interesting stuff, then this game slowly starting to get some speed, also don't forget to build houses for them.  The first time when I was capable enough to take on the Wall of Flesh, I was very certain this was the final boss of the game, until for the surprise it unlocked the hardmode and I reacted by saying: ""I'm sorry what?""  Upon that moment I realized the adventure was just getting started, but eventually I was getting bored with the game even couple years later when I played with group of friends, it didn't take long until we decided to stop playing. Although I did enjoy the fun time in the game and I will never forget that time when I tricked someone to step on the pressure plate that was rigged with explosives.  Few years later I decided to check back in the game and wow how much it has been changed from and started to play again to see what new and exciting things to discover and this time I did play little bit longer.  On this time I felt it gave more content than enough for me to at least write down the review, but oddly enough it felt like it was missing something from all this so I decided not to make the review.  Upon this year near spring time, they announced upcoming perhaps truly final update for the game: ""Journey's End""  That update was a huge one when it arrived and I personally felt like it is finally time to finally finish this game on hardest possible difficulty, so I finally created my final character, my final world, readying my copper blade and getting almost instantly killed by green slime!   Yes...   it is that hard, but I decided to keep going even if it was going to drive me completely insane because of it, until on that moment when I soldiered on this pure madness, I finally was face to face with the official final boss of Terraria... The Moon Lord and boy how much tries it took until I was near only 3 HP left on my character before finally defeating it and it never felt so good when I saw it dying and seeing the credit rolling for the first time.  But...  Now I feel this adventure isn't just over yet, especially when they added new content and I now have a urge to conquer the master mode and something else from beyond.  Now for the actual review.   Goods  +Gameplay Gameplay of the game is very simple at first, but it steadily get harder when you find new tools, weapons and trinkets that give you new way to play the game and there are basically ""classes"" on the game, for example: warrior, summoner, archer/gunner and mage, there are more ""classes"" but you can make your own ""class"" by mixing up the armor, trinkets and others giving you chance to experiment every items what you find and what mostly suit your style.  +Art style The art style of the game is really pretty and all these years the art style has been improved quite a lot and especially the background since every area change the scenery and certain event affect the scenery as well, there are also lots of small details to see and some few changes on clouds as well.  +Music The music of this game is pure classic and all of them did have the tunes improved little bit and few news has been added after the journey's end update, there is also now otherworld version of ost that you can change it in the game after finding the certain secret.  +Price It's literally 10€ for several hours of fun and especially with friends.   Decents  =playtime You can easily sink great amount of time on either playing the game to end, crafting your perfect world or anything else, although if you just made completely new character and new world, the playtime might take quite a time until you get on the speed.  =Loot drop chance It might be little bit annoying to try getting the certain items from certain enemy, but there are few ways to make it easier.   Bads  -bugs/crashing I can't think of anything else being bad than bugged game or game crashing out of nowhere, but these are so rare you could just say: ""what bugs?""   Conclusion This game is pure classic since it was almost 10 years of it release on steam and this ""final"" update really show how much RE-Logic care about this game and it's fans, not only you get this great game pretty cheap, you also get lots of fun to explore the world, fighting powerful enemies, finding awesome treasures, build your own world and last but most importantly making your own story on this game on yourself or with your friends.  Welp, that's all for now.  Doktor Greenman, logging out."
172184787,english,1,105600,"Not often do I review games I enjoy, but the mindless wave of negative reviews has made me want to write SOMETHING.  Terraria is a game of passion, obvious from the decade the developers have spent updating and improving on the already-solid framework. It features some of the best 2-D combat I've ever experienced, a gorgeous art style, and a very satisfying progression.  All this is not to mention the countless high quality fan-made mods - Calamity, Thorium, and many others add dozens (if not hundreds) of extra hours of gameplay. The players are just as passionate about this game as the developers.  Most negative reviews (at the time of writing) don't criticize the game itself, rather the fact the devs don't share their political ideologies. It's disappointingly childish. While the game does have its flaws, don't look to these reviews for them right now.  If, by some off-chance, you are reading this and have never played the game, try it out! It may introduce you to a new favorite! Don't let the drama scare you off."
69858045,english,1,105600,"Objectively one of the most well-designed games on the market, right up there with Minecraft.  TL;DR for people who hate reading: game good, buy it.  Now, Terraria is often compared to Minecraft. However, these two games couldn't be more different. While both games share some similar mechanics, Minecraft has a heavy focus on creativity and survival, while Terraria has way more focus on combat depth and exploration. Lots of people call this game a ""sandbox game"", and I disagree with that. It's definitely more of a 2-D action RPG with sandbox elements. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to be comparing and contrasting this game with Minecraft, since everyone and their mother is familiar with it and most people are gonna come to Terraria thinking it's just 2D Minecraft.  So let's get into it, shall we? Minecraft has a straightforward gear progression system: Wood, Stone, Gold, Iron, Diamond, Netherite. Whereas Terraria has a very complex gear progression system that often gives you choices between gear sets. Gear and weapons are divided into different ""classes"": Ranged, Magic, Melee, and Summon. They're all equally viable, the only difference is that they all have different playstyles. Certain classes are better at certain fights than others, but in the end it all equals out. You won't even have access to all the gear sets or weapons in your first playthrough. This is because some of the ores and even biomes are randomly swapped out for something else entirely! For example, your world can either generate with Cobalt or Palladium, never both. So this gives the game tons of replay value if you want to experience everything, as different gear sets, weapons, and accessories often have different effects.  Minecraft has two bosses, whereas Terraria has somewhere around twenty, all with different mechanics and a huge variety of strategies with which you can use against them. Unlike Minecraft, building and crafting actually facilitates the combat. By that, I mean that you can build a dedicated arena complete with platforms, regen stations, mana regen stations, defense buffs, etc. to aid you in combat, and you can customize it to your needs. Do you want to automate the boss-killing process? You can do that. Defeating certain bosses also gives you access to new gear, places, and items. All of this gives the player a sense of progression, like they're always working towards something. There's also plenty of optional bosses, as well as random invasions that you can tackle. In Minecraft, the attitude is very ""do what you want"", which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Terraria's philosophy is just different. You can do what you want, but if you want to access a wider variety of blocks to build with or just want something a bit more challenging, that's what the progression system is for.  Next up are NPCs. Remember those Testificates in Minecraft that forced you to use a shoddy currency to buy low tier items for exorbitant prices? Well, Terraria does NPCs right. Terraria has a dedicated currency system unlike Minecraft (No, emeralds are not a dedicated currency system). This is your standard Bronze>Silver>Gold>Platinum MMO system. This currency is not mined, but is dropped from enemies. The NPCs in this game--and there are a lot of them--require you to build a house for them. Certain NPCs like/dislike certain biomes, and like/dislike certain neighbors. Each NPC has a unique function. For example, the Nurse will heal you to full health for a price, and the Clothier sells vanity items. Having two or more NPCs housed near each other will give you access to the pylon system, depending on how happy your NPCs are. Pylons are a teleport system designed to get you to house NPCs in several small villages throughout the world instead of all in one big base at your spawn point. Doing this will allow you to teleport to each of the villages you set up. This is a huge boon, because while the world isn't basically infinite like Minecraft's world, Terraria's worlds are still rather huge, and getting from point A to point B can be a really tedious task without these pylons.  Terraria also has a looming, omnipresent threat that creates a sense of urgency once you defeat a certain boss. These are the infectious biomes, the Corruption, the Crimson, and the Hallow. These biomes will begin to spread throughout the world, and if you let them run amok for too long, they may well consume your entire world. The Corruption and Crimson biomes are evil, and will always be dangerous and hostile environments. These evil biomes spread like a cancer, and NPCs won't live anywhere near them, forcing you to constantly build and move NPCs to new houses if something isn't done about it.  The Hallow in particular isn't necessarily an evil biome like the Corruption or the Crimson, but allowing it to spread rampant can lock access to various items and blocks that you would otherwise need to gain an edge over the next boss. You will need to employ various strategies to either keep these infectious biomes at bay, or eradicate them completely. In contrast, Minecraft is extremely laid back, with no sense of urgency. Again, Terraria and Minecraft are two very different games.  I could go on and on about the game's mechanics, but I've listed the main ones above. So, looking at the game objectively, here's my verdict. The character creation screen is sufficiently robust for the type of game that it is. You have multiple difficulty options, including Journey mode, which is a psuedo-creative mode with its very own progression system. The boss progression never gets too tedious and is always exciting whenever one spawns, as each one has a very different but heavy presence. The final boss is exceedingly challenging regardless of what difficulty you play on, which is honestly how it should be. After you complete progression on a world, you can start a sort of ""new game+"" in a new world, carrying over all your items and gear to the next if you so choose. I don't recommend this, as it basically breaks the game because difficulty does not scale with number of playthroughs on a single character, unless that's your thing. On a casual playthrough on a single world, it'll probably take you anywhere from 4 to 40 hours to beat, depending on what pace you like to go at. After that, you'll definitely want to play again and again. The pixel art is incredibly well done, especially with the recent overhaul. The music is some of my favorite in the video game industry, because it has such a unique personality. The community for this game is outstanding, and very alive. If you finished the game and want more out of it, Terraria does have mod support, so mod to your heart's content!  I really couldn't think of anything about this game that I disliked. I mean, one could argue that sometimes the bosses expect a bit too much from the player. Or maybe you'll just get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of items you're going to pick up if you're a packrat. But I honestly can't think of anything that is objectively bad about this game. So yeah, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone. My family and I play it together and everyone loves it.   Terraria recently released their latest and final patch ""Journey's End"" which added an obscene amount of content to the game! Re-Logic really treats their playerbase well, and I definitely look forward to what they have to offer in the future."

82815094,english,1,105600,"I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.  Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further.   Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime.   After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on.   With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.  I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me.   Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors.   Sincerely, Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen"

69306612,english,1,105600,"After playing the game since 2011 I have just realized I have never left a review.  Well... I have pirated the game and then I have bought game several times for myself, and several times as a gift for others. I have played the game solo, with friends, with my girlfriend and planning to introduce it to my daughters (who were born since the game launched). I have spent hundreds of hours on 1.0... hundreds of hours on 1.1... on 1.2... on  1.3... and planning to spend hundreds more on 1.4. I have built, fought, explored, created wild-life reservation worlds as well as apocalyptic wastelands...   So I guess, it's not that bad game after all."
32026626,english,1,105600,"Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10"
47798793,english,1,105600,"So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria:   - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements - It has an incredible amount of content to it - Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class) - Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy - A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight - Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now) - Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped!  - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore! - I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTING  Cons? Hmm.  - Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized! - Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though. - Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me. - Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game.   Other thought:  - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.  Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):  I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.  Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.  There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is.   I spent $10 on this."

80853945,english,1,105600,"This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a game, and I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offline, as well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years ago, I asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap, 10 US dollars at the time, which is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this game, as well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to download, I was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retro, and the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to time, ripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldn’t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the game, the music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own character, so many different styles and colours, so many choices and personalization’s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first character, and after that, I was set out into a mysterious world, filled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shuriken’s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hill, I had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every direction, and with demon eyes flying overhead, death was inevitable.  As soon as I respawned, my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventually, we held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay in, and that’s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building.   There are so sososososososo many blocks to build, hammer and axe together in intuitive, creative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for building, as the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing builds, and it only got better with each update. There was sloping blocks, paint, different walls, how each block melded together, how each block interacted with other blocks, the light sources, the different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform.   After I was done building my house, I set out to find more loot to plunder. That’s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for me, so the combat was less punishing then I’d like it to be, but the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfying, even hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculately, precariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which way, you have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think you’ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of fire, the game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.  The gameplay loop is a satisfying composition of combat, farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPC’s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boom, rare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the future, skipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the game, it has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the last, and it keeps pushing you forward, to the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straight, and I only got 1. I did other stuff in between, sure, but the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewarding, it is peaceful at times.  With the Journeys end update, the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftop, listening to the songs and watching my NPC’s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this game, its not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its community, from steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic game, and I could not recommend it more.  I absolutely adore this game, and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years. My words could never do it justice, even though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to me.   Thanks for reading 😊"

The content is beyond overwhelming with many bosses, challenges and options that you won’t ever get bored of. The game revolves around [b] you [/b] the player, as the difficulty and gameplay change depending upon your progression. The art style and music are very exceptional, bringing us the fanbase pleasant memories even to this day.  [h1] 📖 Setting: [/h1] [h3] Summary [/h3] Terraria is a land full of mystery and wonder. You the adventure are given the task to cleanse this magical world from the spreading [b] cancer [/b] called Hollow/Corruption. Many powerful beings will stand in your way, so grab some loot, find allies and restore the balance. Since many players forget the fact that Terraria includes a story in the first place. I suggest you read the lore from the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Lore] Wiki [/url] to get accustomed to the plot.  [h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1] Terraria refers to casual and hardcore players alike. You can slay forces or start creating buildings, without though being obliged to do so. The game offers a variety of blocks and items that encourage creativity. You can even build your mini-golf park! The goal here is to have fun and not just constantly grind for loot.  [h3] Difficulty [/h3] The actual Difficulty mode is a character set selected during character creation. There are 5 types of difficulty: Softcore, Mediumcore, Hardcore and the newly added [b] Journey [/b] mode that can only be played on journey worlds. All the above-mentioned modes change the penalty upon death.  [table] [tr] [th] Description[/th] [th] Difficulty [/th] [/tr] [tr] [td] Characters start with extra equipment [/td] [td] Journey [/td]  [/tr]  [tr]  [td] Characters drop [b] coins [/b] upon death [/td]  [td] Classic [/td]  [/tr]  [tr]  [td] Characters drop [b] items [/b] on death [/td]  [td] Mediumcore [/td]  [/tr] [tr]  [td] Characters cannot [b] respawn!! [/b]  [/td]  [td] Hardcore [/td]  [/tr]  [/table]  Another form of difficulty is [b] world modes. [/b] Those are separate settings that apply to the [b] world, [/b] rather than the [b] character. [/b] Players may choose between Journey, Classic, Expert, and Master mode when creating a new seed. Each mode provides more loot, as well as special accessories depending on the difficulty you have chosen. I advise [b] new [/b] players to start with the Classic mode, as Expert and Master are very demanding for a novice adventurer. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894347971 [h3] Starting your adventure [/h3] Terraria starts its gameplay slow and steady, as it should be. You begin your journey with only 3 tools (sword, axe, pickaxe) at your disposal and a companion useful for his crafting guides. It’s up to [b] you [/b] the player whether you want to challenge the game since your imagination, skill and creativity shape the word and thus the adventure. As a tip, I suggest you start building a small house in the beginning. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894343444 [h3] Interactive playstyle [/h3] Terraria forces [b] you [/b] the player to manipulate the environment to survive. You can chop trees used for crafting; mine rocks used for building or combine all the materials to cross large gaps etc. Physics plays a major role in the game’s playstyle, so do expect lots of deaths caused by [b] fall damage. [/b] There is also a small detail concerning nightfall, but that’s a surprise for you to explore. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894342641 [h3] Scaling [/h3] [b] Grinding [/b] Terraria is very famous for its grinding potential. There are many repeatable bosses, each offering different and unique [b] treasure bags [/b] that are considered valuable for your future encounters. Countless items offered by a specific boss or gained by certain activities, such as fishing, have a very low [b] drop percentage [/b]. This concept favours repeatability, so do be patient, as sometimes even the best things in life take a while.  [b] Classes [/b] There are 4 classes in Terraria: Magic, Ranged, Melee and Summoning. Each class requires different armour sets and weapons that provide unique stats and abilities, depending upon the material they were made from. It is most favourable to stick with 1 class during a playthrough, as this way you can aim your focus on specific items and equipment.

146636516,english,1,105600,"Terraria is old, very old... it had so many ""this is the final update"" updates that I lost count, the developers seem to just love it too much to let go (all of said upgrades of course completely free!)  The level of value delivered for this game is unbelievable, fun platforming, fun combat, fun exploration, it's a complete package of all things awesome that a 2d game can offer.  Not to mention how much you can extend your experience with mods and special seeds (added by the developers) that fundamentally change the game.  On top of that, re-logic (the makers of terraria) just decided to support Godot and FNA to help out other game developers hopefully achieve a similar level of success that they did... a true class act.  I bought terraria in all platforms I own, highly highly highly recommended, 10 bucks for THOUSANDS of hours for high quality fun is a steal"
16212660,english,1,105600,"This Indie sandbox game really has a little something for everyone. Whether you are into building, creating pixel art, PvP, PvE, this game has something for you!  Once you've made your character, you start off in the world of Terraria. Your first goal is survival. During the first day, you deal with pesky slimes while you gather the materials needed to build a shelter before nightfall. Once night comes, the undead swarm you. Are you resting safely in your new house, or are you forced to fight until daybreak?  If you thought slimes and undead were all you had to worry about in this world, you were wrong. Outlandish minions and deadly bosses await every turn, as you explore the many different environments in the world. Defeating them will reward you with new materials, weapons, armor, and even trophies to display.  Beware of the corruption, an environment native to Terraria, that slowly spreads, trying to shroud your world in darkness. Or, will your world contain the crimson? A festering landscape, oozing with blood and flesh that constantly tries to devour you. You will not be left defenceless against these horrors, however! You can work to purify the land to its original state.  In your travels, you will find resources that you can mine and gather. Combine them into powerful weapons and armor, or shape them into building blocks for new structures. As you grow and progress, NPCs will begin to flock to your buildings, offering you aid. You will even find some out in the world, waiting to be rescued.  Tunnel through the earth, or take wing and fly to the clouds. Purify or corrupt. Build or destroy. The world of Terraria is yours to explore, and mold into your image."

You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble.   It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there.

[/h1]  To be completely honest, for years I did not like Terraria. The biggest problem with the game is you literally don't know what to do or how to progress in the game without looking up a guide on the Terraria Wiki, or by asking more experienced players. To me, I just find that as bad game design.  There could have been some sort of quest log that gave you some indication of what to do next, otherwise the beginning of the game becomes rather dull.  Moving on, once you do know what you are doing, the game becomes surprisingly more enjoyable as Terraria focuses on combat and boss encounters. Each boss is different from one another, and are actually challenging. The game limits you from getting better gear until a specific boss is defeated which keeps the challenge high throughout.  Apart from that, as you kill bosses new enemies and events will appear in the game unlocking a vast new variety of weapons, items, and equipment.   One thing I had not realized is the incredible amount of content Terraria offers. As soon as you think you are done with the game, it just keeps going with even more bosses, more grind for even better gear, and just so much new stuff as you go along. (be sure to keep checking the wiki to see what bosses are next and how to unlock them)   [b]It is very important that you play this game with a friend. Playing it solo is simply not as fun, especially considering the time investment.[/b]   General overview: + Loads of content + Fun combat system with a large variety of weapons, spells, and gear. + Lots of fantastic bosses + Very challenging + An ever-changing world with loads to explore + Great fun with friends + Very easy to host a server and game is very minimal on resources (meaning anyone with a PC can enjoy this, even on a laptop)  - Somewhat impossible to progress without a guide - The first half of the game is rather boring compared to the later half - A bit straining on the eyes with pixel graphics, especially with a high resolution monitor - A bit too challenging at times (especially playing solo) - Resources are limited, meaning you won't be able to get items without generating a new world (your character can move between worlds and servers)  [b]Highly recommend generating a medium to large world[/b]   To sum things up, Terraria is a fantastic game to play with at least one friend (preferably just 2-4 ). It offers an extremely high amount of content, lots of bosses, fun gameplay, lots to explore and craft, and its cheap!   +++ Highly recommend."

77993818,english,1,105600,"My first ever Steam game. Boy was it a great 8 years, or however long it was. Sadly, the journey has come to an end. We all knew this was coming, after 1.3 came with the true endgame it was only a few years' time for the finale.  Back when I first joined, I was a little guy. Started playing back in the 1.1 days. I learned the ropes, and I had a lot of fun. Most of my time was occupied by another childhood favorite, Minecraft, however I played this quite often too. I found a server, and started playing some minigames, meeting people, and fighting bosses with them. Those times were great.  Then came 1.2, a glorious time. I started my first true playthrough, as a ranger, and was determined to beat the Golem, which I did after some time. I ended up painting my entire spawn in negative colors because I was bored. Those were also fun times.  After that came 1.3, the endgame. I wasn't playing it much during this time, due to not being able to use a computer, but I played it and it was enjoyable nonetheless. I met more people, played more games, did more playthroughs, and I ended up getting into mods.  But eventually, things go as they come.  1.4 is a bittersweet update, to say the least. It made the game look so much better, and performed smoother overall too. The changes added were astronomical, but nothing truly game-changing, well except for Empress of Light. The new Master mode is okay, but it lost so much potential it could have had. x10 spawnrate is also fun, but I only put some 40 hours into that. Got pretty far, but it just got too strenuous, with school starting up and all too.  A game I once knew to be simply three mechanical bosses and some hallowed gear changed into the vibrant landscape it is today, but never to change anymore. It's one of many relics lost to time of my childhood, and one that will go in my mind as a great memory collection, yet not to be added to much more. I might play this game here and there, but it just isn't what it used to be.  May I wish you all good luck in your virtues, and hope you all have a great time, as I once did. Just don't get it get to your heart too much, otherwise it will pull hard."

150159381,english,1,105600,"I wanted to write this review after I spent enough time in the game and have gotten most of the achievements. So now that I’m about 109/115 achievements & 100 hours playtime, I feel I can finally give an adequate review.   I felt this game was hard to get into at the beginning but if you have someone help you through the first steps in learning the game play and crafting mechanics, it gets easier and more fun. It’s hard because at the start, you basically are some weak homeless dude and have to fight off slimes, collect and craft, materials build your own house before it gets dark (and pretty much do this for the entirety of the game but as you progress, you get to upgrade your gear and it gets easier). It sounds like a grind but it’s well-worth it. It’s somewhat satisfying to build yourself up from the beginning, from wood walls to the solar or vortex brick or something.   The coolest part of the game is the crafting and building aspects of it. There’s so many different types of materials, which you can make into various styles of brick or wall paper, even furniture (like balloon furniture). There’s so much customizability in how you can build your houses. There’s different environments or “biomes” so you build houses that are befitting of that specific biome and then you get NPC’s to move in. You can also collect weird paintings which you can decorate your houses with.    There’s different game modes too so if you want a challenge, you can play hardcore or if you just want to build, you can do journey mode which allows you to duplicate items so you don’t have to destroy your world mining it all. It’s one of those games where there’s no right way to play. Play how you want and play how you think is most fun.  The music and the scenery in the game is also very pleasant, so it’s a very nice chill relax game. It’s nice solo and coop. 10/10 would recommend.  [b]In brief, here's some aspects I loved about it:[/b]  [list]     [*] environment & character customization     [*] crafting, collecting, and building     [*] open world exploration of different scenic environments     [*] soundtrack (that corresponds with the biome)      [*] different game modes and difficulties     [*] adorable creatures throughout the biomes  [/list]   Notice, I didn't mention combat in my review. Eh, it's not my type of game combat wise but that's the beauty of this game. There's different game modes where you can choose what type of experience you want from the game. Some go for those hardcore challenge runs and I go for Journey mode because I love the buidling and crafting elements."
71027789,english,1,105600,What could I possibly say? You don't spend 900 hours in a 10 dollar game if it sucks.
51279217,english,1,105600,"Terraria is one of the top rated games on steam. And honestly, it deserves it. I think this is a damn good game. I won’t say it’s a perfect game and there are certainly some things you should know before you buy it, but I will happily give it a recommend.  [u]Let Me Begin with What the Game is About and What Makes it Cool.[/u] You start out with a basic sword, axe, and pickaxe, in the middle of nowhere. You’re first step is to get wood and build a shelter to protect you from the zombies at night. Next you need to dig down and get ore to make better gear. So it’s 2d minecraft? Well it’s more than that, let me continue. You’ll need decent armor and weapons to fight the tougher monsters that live underground and to fight bosses.   Yep bosses. Bosses are one of the defining elements of this game. Bosses are big and imposing and they play this awesome adrenaline music when you summon them (a lot of the Terraria music is awesome btw). And there’s a huge variety of bosses too: There’s a floating eye that aggressively charges at you, there’s a big worm creature that breaks into smaller worms as you damage it, there’s an angry plant that can only be fought in the claustrophobic jungle, there’s a cult leader that summons mirages of itself and makes the game into a bullet hell with how many projectiles it spits out. Now bosses can be very punishing, but this is a building/crafting game, so you can build your own arena with platforms to jump on and walls to protect you from (some) attacks, or craft potions that boost your speed, health regen, armor, and damage. The fact that you can tackle bosses on your own terms in your own arena is one of the most interesting parts of the game and it really makes boss fights feel epic.   Killing bosses is the main way you progress through the game. Killing them gives you some kickass loot or lets you access a parts of the world where you can discover some more kickass loot. There’s a lot of loot in this game. And it’s some pretty cool loot too. You get staffs that call meteors down from the sky, fireball staffs, swords that shoot fireballs, machine guns, rocket launchers, different kinds of ammo to go in your guns, yo-yo’s (yo-yos are a really cool weapon), boomerangs, tools that summon monsters or turrets to fight for you, tools that let you jump real high (useful for dodging boss attacks), vehicles that let you move real fast, grappling hooks for going spelunking. The more bosses you kill and the further you progress, the more powerful and interesting the loot you get. Seriously, getting new loot just feels absolutely wonderful in this game.  So yeah, I would say mining, boss fighting, and collecting loot are the meat of the game, but there’s plenty of gravy too. Maybe you want to take a break from boss fighting and do some fishing so you can get a chainsaw fish and also some potion ingredients. Well then you probably want to create a few ponds throughout your world. And you’ll probably want to set up some minecart tracks or teleporters to get to your ponds quickly. Or maybe you want to set up a mushroom farm because mushroom are good for potions as well as crafting some late game armor. Well you’ll want to create several rows of dirt so the mushrooms have plenty of surface area to spawn on. And if you don’t want to harvest mushrooms manually you can set up a bunch of conveyor belts and wire so the mushrooms just fall down and come to you. Or maybe a part of your world is corrupt. Corruption spreads slowly so you may want to dig a trench around it to keep it quarantined, or you can buy a special gun that cleanses corruption outright. Or maybe you need a bunch of unicorn horns. You could go to the part of the world where unicorns spawn and kill them with your flaming yo-yo. Or you could dig a big pit and every time a unicorn come by it falls into the pit and dies because the pit is full of lava and spiky traps. This is a crafting game where enemies are just another crafting resource, so setting up a death pit to farm unicorns is a logical thing to do. There’s plenty of stuff to do in Terraria and plenty of ways to do it.   [u]And Now for the Parts of the Game You Might Not Find so Cool.[/u] First of all, the difficulty. Specifically, the bosses. Bosses will kill you. Bosses are tough. You can give yourself boosts with potions and armor, but dodging attacks is your best bet. And that can be very difficult when the boss charges rapidly at you or shoots a dozen balls of lightning at you. You will need to learn the attack patterns of bosses and you will need to train your reflexes. I mentioned bullet hell earlier, and I really do think this game has bullet hell elements. If you just can’t stand bullet hell games you probably want to avoid Terraria. (Since difficulty is a pretty subjective thing, you may want to look up a video review of Terraria and see some boss fights and combat for yourself.)  Another thing I want to mention is the sheer amount of stuff to learn. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Terraria wiki. It’s a crafting game, so you’ll need to look up crafting recipes as well as how to get ingredients. It’s also a game about fighting giant bosses, so you’ll need to know how to summon bosses and you’ll probably want to read some tips on making an arena. If you want to build a garden or fishing pond you’ll want to know when certain herbs bloom and how much water to put in your pond. For building more complex structures, you may want to look up tutorials on youtube (the game has gone through several updates though, so some youtube tutorials are out of date). Personally, I kinda enjoyed learning the game. I’d get some weird item in my inventory and immediately going to the wiki to see what I could do with it. But I realize not everyone wants to study a wiki while they play video games.   One of the interesting parts of the game is how it’s a building/fighting hybrid kind of game. And while that’s cool some of the time, it can be really annoying at other times. Say you’re underground building an arena to fight a boss, then a bat flies out at you, now you have to stop building and take out your weapon. So you kill the bat and try to get back to building, but another bat spawns and you have to kill that one too. The game literally has a formula where if it detects there aren’t any enemies near you it will spawn new enemies, so you will constantly have to fight off annoying enemies while you’re trying to build or mine. (I should mention that there are tools that help deal with enemy harassment, but you need to know how to get them, which reinforces my point that you need to read the wiki)   I don’t really like Terraria’s endgame. Most of the early and midgame consists of exploring, building, and crafting, with the occasional action-packed boss fight thrown in, which I like because it offers some nice variety. However the endgame is back-to-back combat. Fight a boss, then fight a bunch of minibosses, then fight another boss, then fight four living towers which spawn very fast very dangerous enemies, then fight another boss. For my first playthrough of this game I stopped playing when I got to the endgame because I just didn’t want to slog through all the fighting. Now, I actually like the combat and I liked fighting bosses throughout the game, but it’s a simple combat system and fighting loses some of its charm when you do it for too long.   So this review turned out longer than I expected. I guess I wanted to be thorough. When I first played this game I got pretty frustrated at times and I was prepared to toss out the game altogether. But then I got into it a bit more and learned the mechanics better and I actually really liked it. Despite its flaws, this is probably one of my favorite games ever."

67608782,english,1,105600,"Absolute classic. Whenever I play it feels like I'm progressing whether it be getting a new weapon, killing a boss or just building a really nice house for an NPC it always feels like I'm moving forward. Surprisingly, the game hasn't really seemed to show any signs of its age despite being almost 9 years old at this point. The music is fantastic especially during boss fights. Boss fights have a perfect challenge level when you do them with the intended gear and there are a whole lot of bosses to fight throughout the game. The game has a ""halfway point"" just when you start to feel established which really puts you back on your toes and creates an excellent dynamic without taking anything away from the player. Expert mode feels like a perfect challenge for people who have a lot of experience by adding new mechanics or just small buffs to each boss. Overall one of my favourite games of all time."

When pronouncing this word, I immediately feel warm in my soul, I remember the wonderful soundtrack and completely immerse myself in my thoughts. Before reviewing, I immediately want to note that this game gave me a new perception of computer games, and gave me a great childhood.  I myself am not an ordinary player in Terraria, and there are few such oldies, because I got acquainted with Terraria even before its release, or more precisely, before the official release of the game on Steam (May 16, 2011). And although I have played 200 hours of this game in my Steam, I actually played it for about 1000 hours. When I was little, I, like all children, played Minecraft, and I really liked this game, I thought that I could not find a better game. But one fine day, my dad came home from work and told me about Terraria, which just appeared. Another employee told Dad about the game, and another employee told this employee, and then I don't know the story of the spread of rumors about a brand new freshly baked Terraria. When I first started the game, I created my character, spending several hours on it, pressed the button to create a world, and found myself on the ground. Someone walked next to me, his name was Guide, who first fell into the abyss ... I don't know why he did it, but it didn't really bother me. The first thing I learned was how to walk, jump and dig, and it was incredibly fun! After that I dug a hole for myself, buried myself on top and went to play Minecraft ... Don't judge strictly, but for a child then Minecraft was much more colorful, and had a 3D view, and not a cropped 3D space along the Z axis. But a couple of days later I went back in into the game, and again continued to explore the world, the game did not cause as much enthusiasm for me as many people who have started playing quite recently. And I don't know if it's good that I started playing such a raw game. But as time went on, I studied the world of Terraria more and more. I got to know cute teardrop-mongers and creatures that were constantly killing me. I realized that I needed a home to live, and that's when I discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of all the games I've played - building. So I gave up traveling and started BUILDING and DIGGING! And then this game completely sucked me in. I quit Minecraft and started DIGGING, KILLING, AND EXPLORING. I met new residents who can SELL! And a nurse who can CHOOSE! I also realized that the Guide is not a useless piece of garbage, and that you can have a heart-to-heart talk with him. In the end, I killed the ominous Eye of Cthulhu, which sowed fear, and the game ended there ... But soon new updates came out, I downloaded new versions and went all over again. And it was interesting. I went through each update, and did not get a mental pleasure. Since I like everything more difficult, I started playing the game on the Expert Advisor, and later on the Master. But all this was not enough for me! And I started to go through mods, for those who know Calamity mod, I went through this game with Revenge and Death modes, and also after a few hundred attempts I went through Boss Rush. Then I lost my nerves.  With each update, the game brought new emotions and a colorful world to the players and me. Every progress you make is much more satisfying than the last one and continues to push you forward, to the point where you don't stop. There is no point in talking about old versions, so I'll tell you a couple (hundreds) of words about the new Terraria.  For me this game became a home in which I felt comfortable. The game is currently in the game about 500 varieties of mobs. There are also 19 bosses and 13 mini-bosses, as well as 3 additional bosses in the mobile version. And from listing recipes you can break your tongue. Sloped blocks, paints, different walls were added to the game, each block merged together, each block interacted with other blocks. Light sources, different platforms that you may have used. All of this and more meant that anything imaginable could be built. Many people create amazing mechanisms and worlds, better than on paper!) Although they made a convenient interface for creating my character in the game, I also devote a lot of time to creating a character). And the music and style of play makes me crazy. I bought this game for my every account, and made all my friends, no matter if it was voluntary, to purchase this masterpiece. And if you are thinking whether to buy this game, I can hardly answer you ... YES !!! This game is amazing both solo and when playing with friends! You can catch hares and then fill the whole world of your friend with them! It's worth buying for this!  I can confidently say that Terraria has become my corner of safety, this is my home, there is no place easier and quieter than it.  Thanks Andrew Spinks, Whitney Spinks ❤ Thanks Re-Logic ❤ Thanks Terraria ❤ Thanks for reading ❤"

It's very relaxing to just take care of your world, and if you want some excitement, there are plenty of enemies lurking above as well as below ground. If you haven't played Terraria yet,  give it a shot. I think you'll find hours of entertainment in this classic masterpiece. So far, I've played nearly 5000 hours and I still love it! Cheers"

105945973,english,1,105600,"The amount of labor, love, and time that the developers have spent fine-tuning and improving this game is truly astounding. With over 5000 items, 28 bosses and minibosses, easy multiplayer access, and mod support all wrapped up into a $10 bundle with no extra microtransactions or DLC, Terraria is a masterpiece that large-scale game companies could only dream of making. A single playthrough can easily last you over 30+ hours, for most, that is barely the tip of the iceberg.  This is a game that you can play and replay multiple times and still discover new items and mechanics with each playthrough. Every new world is a new adventure, a new place for creativity, an escape from reality to let your inner imagination run loose. Nothing pushes or pressures you to rush through the game, it is a self-paced journey that, despite the many labels put onto it, has no real end. Some people play the game to find new items and accessories, others play to build the ideas that live in their minds, but no matter how you decide to play the game, there is something for everyone to enjoy. Relogic called the 1.4 update “Journey’s End,” but I think that, even now, it is just the beginning.  In addition to all of this, the multiplayer in this game is absolutely phenomenal. Playing, chatting, and enjoying the game with friends is an incredible experience*. The pacing of the game barely changes compared to single-player and the atmosphere and ideas that can run through your world can be incredible. Access to the steam workshop, a place where you can share your creations or see the creations of others, is also a great addition to the game**.   Unfortunately, no game can be perfect in every way, I do have a few minor issues with the game.  RNG: Most items in Terraria are commonly available throughout the game. However, a very select few are very Rng dependent and can often feel like a chore to grind for. Fortunately, most of these items are entirely optional such as the information accessories and some late-game boss drops. Summoner Class: There are 4 main fighting classes in the game, Melee, Ranger, Mage, and Summoner. The latter is a unique class that uses minions to fight for you. This is a fantastic concept, but it is very poorly executed due to the lack of variety of summoner weapons and armor. Master Mode is a new difficulty in Terraria that was added in the 1.4 update, which increases the difficulty of the game by tripling the monster’s health and damage… that’s it. Other than a few extra cosmetic items, Master Mode is simply Expert Mode but with more enemy health. It doesn’t add anything new or interesting so it is usually best to just avoid it unless you are into that type of gameplay.  These are very minor flaws with the game and absolutely do not impact the overall gameplay or enjoyability at all. Terraria is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have had, the time I spent playing by myself and friends during the lockdown was definitely time well spent. If you are someone who enjoys building games, combat of all types, exploration, or just want a game that is a mixture of all of these, then I definitely recommend buying this game. If Relogic had made the updates cost money, then I absolutely would have paid, and the fact that they continue to add free updates to this game 10 years after its release just goes to show how much they care about their player and fanbase, and that is absolutely something I am willing to support.   * If you plan to start a multiplayer world with more than two people, I highly recommend playing on an expert mode world because of the modified boss drops. If you play on a normal world, then you will get boss drops equivalent to the boss drops of single-player, whereas an expert world’s boss drops are equivalent to the number of players on the world.   ** Terraria also has fantastic mod support, with the developers at Relogic just recently updating TModLoader to 1.4, and though I have never played modded Terraria, I have heard fantastic things about all kinds of community creations.   TL;DR  Good game, you should buy"

112310637,english,1,105600,"As someone who's over 1800 hours in, I can tell you with confidence that this game is a MASTERPIECE.  There are A LOT of things I could say about Terraria, but put quite simply: it's worth every penny.  The bosses are a blast, each class is fun in their own unique way, Expert difficulty is perfection (Normal is too easy and you get less loot; don't ever play on Normal), even the NPCs all have their uses!  Technically speaking, an NPC is only ever useless depending on your class or personal preference (e.g. some people may not care for the Angler achievements, or a mage might not care for the Arms Dealer, etc.).  You will always have something to do, at pretty much any given point in the game.  And even when you've 'beaten' the game and gotten bored of your world, you could just make a new character, new world, and have a totally new experience!  Then, even if you get bored of that, you can download tModloader for FREE, and mod the game to your hearts' content!  It's affordable, can run on most hardware, and is, dare-I-say, the perfect gaming experience.  I can't recommend this game enough."
186265741,english,1,105600,"I have over 2k hours in this game, and I think I can safely say it's infinitely replayable and incredibly enjoyable. Great bosses, fun stat progression, sandbox building, etc. Highly recommend."

It is simplistic enough to jump right into and yet at the same time, complex enough to keep one playing for years and years. The three pillars of the game are Building, Fighting, and Exploring. You have your own little (or not so little) world that is chock full of loot enemies and unique environments for you to kill and build yourself while doing the same to your planet. Good enemies: as varied as the freckle patterns on a persons face fun loot: There are six buttloads of stuff to shoot, slash, equip, or throw. (or explode) Blocks: for the crafty, theres a bunch of different blocks... (like if you though minecraft had a lot of blocks...) Bosses: you keep thinking how am I ever gonna be strong enough to beat that. (then you get strong enough and theres another)  all in all I highly recommend this game. its awesome. 10/10 would (will) definitely play again"

71383430,english,1,105600,"I would like to start off this review by saying one thing. This is one of the best games ever made. Now, most people would probably look at this game and think it's just 2D Minecraft, but it is so much more than that. The main similarities are in the blocks and survival aspects of it. But beyond that Terraria is just so much more.  Summary:  Gameplay - [9] When you start a world for the first time it is a very slow game, but the game quickly picks up the pace. There is no hand-holding in this game whatsoever, you have to do everything yourself or check the Terraria wiki page. You change a lot during your adventure and in the end the game is very fast-paced.  Soundtrack - [10] The soundtrack is some of the best I've ever heard in a sandbox game. It's so simplistic yet so good. It is very catchy and I will never forget the iconic song Overworld Day which is instantly recognized.  Graphics - [10] Since it isn't aiming for realistic graphics you really cannot give it a bad score. It's a very specific kind of art style that fits the game very well.  Price - [10] The price is incredibly cheap compared to what you get. You get a really long game with a bunch of replay value. It costs 9,99€ on Steam but often goes down to 4.99€ during sales. It's a great price.  In conclusion: Terraria is a fantastic game that has everything you would ever want in a game like this. You should really buy this if you want a really good sandbox game. The developers have been supporting this game for years now and still have 1 last update left called Journey's End. Thanks for reading this review."

18435281,english,1,105600,"Alright so I've been playing this game ever since 1.0.4, building stuff, killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming, so it's about time I should actually make a review on this game. I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.  Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.  But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts)."

38067494,english,1,105600,"This is one of the best games ever made and the only reason it is not regarded as such is that it is not very accessible. I can imagine many critics have started Terraria, played for some hours trying to figure it out, and put it away. Very often, critics have drawn misguided conclusions that Terraria resembles Minecraft (or is a Minecraft clone), but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Terraria is a procedurally generated sandbox survival metroidvania. Learning curve is steep, the game is hard and often requires you to consult to wikis and guides (even more so than the Souls series) but once you gain control of the game mechanics, you will find a very deep, hard core gem. Don’t let its eye-candy graphics fool you…  You are dropped into a world surrounded by many dangers. Initially, you are expected to make your first shelter, first weapon and just survive. This is the very core of the whole game. In order to beat stronger creatures, you need better weapons for which you need better crafting material. To get better crafting material, you need to mine deep into the earth, which leads you to find secret chests, face gazillion creatures including “bosses”. Boss fights not only require skill, but also need you to have the weapons, armors, potions, items necessary to beat them. Last, but not the least, there are plenty of events such as Halloween, Christmas, Pirate Invasion etc. with their own unique bosses and loots.  While you are working on mining for better tools, armors, weapons to be able to beat stronger enemies, you also need to keep expanding your “shelter”. A chair, ceiling and door is not sufficient any longer. You need to keep building new rooms to have room for new crafting centers and chests (for inventory). Every new room invites a new NPC to your shelter who can be crucial in your quest to beat the world of terraria, whether they sell unique items or provide healing.  Being a true sandbox game, you can also ignore progression and spend hundreds of hours just building. Your limit to what you can build and how you can customize it is your imagination. People at Terraria subreddit still manage to amaze me with their creativity and sometimes totally mind-blowing architecture.   Whether you choose to play it as a metroidvania or as a sandbox 2d Minecraft, you will love Terraria. In my opinion, it is one of the best games ever made.  [b]PS:[/b] Buy it full price. Developers are still updating content and supporting the game after all these years (without any paid DLCs whatsoever), they really deserve some support.  [b]10/10[/b]"
88490547,english,1,105600,"I've been playing this game since 2014 (on and off obviously) and after journey's end I have to review it just to say the sheer quantity and quality of content in this game is incredible. If you somehow haven't played terraria yet you really should. There is more or less something for everyone, and while it's very fun in single player, especially if you're more into building and collecting items, it's so much more fun with other people. If you're looking for the next game to play with friends or alone, this is it."

7877530,english,1,105600,"Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the ""crafting"" genre seriously. These were my first impressions.  However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!).   The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!  There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!  Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).  If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years)."
2092948,english,1,105600,"Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft. And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends."
57972609,english,1,105600,"""omG iTs jUsT 2dEE mInEcRafT!"" is the only thing I hear as a Terraria player, and I have to say that that is completely and utterly wrong. The game is great once you get into it but I think the reason it is so underrated is because the beginning of the game is a bit lacking. People just start up a world, chop down a tree or die to a slime or something and get bored. With Terraria you have to be patient. The game is difficult and a bit unforgiving at times but with the sheer amount of places to explore and items to find I personally think it's an amazing game. The best part about the game in my opinion is the music. I unironically listen to Terraria music sometimes it's that good. Anyway, I'm gunna go play some Terraria now. Bye!"
32842453,english,1,105600,"Lets get into it shall we   Terraria, the game that makes you question your life choices more than a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book on existentialism. I've spent more time in this pixelated wonderland than I have in the real world, and let me tell you, I regret nothing. My therapist might disagree, but what does she know about the joys of defeating pixelated bosses and building houses for NPCs who can't even say ""thank you""?  With over 1200 hours logged, I can confidently say that Terraria is not just a game; it's a way of life. Forget sunshine and fresh air; I've got mushrooms and glowing ore to keep me company. Who needs friends when you have a loyal army of NPCs, each with their unique quirks and questionable fashion sense?  The variety in this game is mind-boggling. I mean, where else can you go from fighting a gigantic eye to crafting a rainbow gun that shoots unicorns? It's like a fever dream mixed with a dash of pure, unadulterated awesomeness. Terraria is the only place where you can go from feeling like a badass ninja to a master chef whipping up delicacies for your digital neighbors.  Speaking of neighbors, those NPCs are a special bunch. They move in, mooch off your hospitality, and somehow manage to get themselves killed by zombies every other night. It's like living in a retirement home for video game characters, and I love it. Who wouldn't want a nurse, a wizard, and a gun-slinging arms dealer as roommates?  The building aspect of Terraria is like playing with virtual Legos, only better. Sure, you could build a modest little house, but why stop there when you can create a floating island with a disco floor and lava waterfalls? My creativity knows no bounds, and neither does the game's ability to let me indulge in my architectural fantasies.  Terraria is the only game that has me questioning whether I've been spending too much time in the real world. Why go outside when I can explore the vast reaches of the underworld, battle mythical beasts, and collect rare artifacts? The real world doesn't have pixelated penguins, and that's a deal-breaker for me.  In conclusion, Terraria is not just a game; it's a lifestyle. I highly recommend it to anyone who values creativity, exploration, and the ability to ignore real-world responsibilities. With 1200+ hours under my belt, I can confidently say that Terraria is the reason my plants are dead, my dog is hungry, and my social life is practically nonexistent. And you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. Five stars, two thumbs up, and a digital high five to the developers for creating this masterpiece. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dungeon to raid and a virtual pet to feed."

I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun.   I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime.   Do I recommend this game? Yes! Absolutely!

42230477,english,1,105600,"People always love to make the comparision of Terraria and Minecraft. If you ever played this game, you'll know that they shouldn't be compared. In fact, for a single player experience, i'd say Terraria beats Minecraft hands down. But this isn't about Minecraft, so i'll list a few things as to why Terraria is great. Terraria is for those who love the idea of growing and becoming stronger the more you play. In the beginning, you're pretty much helpless, killing the weakest enemies in multiple hits. You move slugglishly, and minor heights and caverns are truly intimidating. In the end, you are a force to be reckoned with, capable of taking down hoards of enemy after enemy mithout even pressing a button - diving to the deepest parts of the world and traversing every terrain with ease.  The change is gradual, and each challenge is tougher than the last. But if you're up for the grind - and its a fun one at that - then Terraria is for you."
49808465,english,1,105600,"At first, this game may seem babyish: with an axe swinging all the way around and a sword looking little less than a porridge stirrer. You have a world, you can flourish and prosper but it is also a dangerous, hostile and menacing environment.   You create your first house: with a chair, table, walls and a background made from supposedly wood.  You create your armour and a new sword and you set of in your quest for salvation. Later on, you gear up; and fight your first boss.   It gets harder over time and you have more and more responsibilities to keep your world on its feet, and don't let the bad thing happen..."
88734962,english,1,105600,"Terraria: Sand Is Overpowered  - Graphics :   2-D vibrant graphics with block-like textures and a ""washed"" look. No HD, ultra-high settings. Just plain old sprites with 2-D.    - Sound :   Electric-type soundtrack. It's a bit unique since it sounds completely original and could almost be classified as something new. Soundtrack aside, all of the items and enemies and humans sound believable. Laser guns have a laser sound, a slime enemy makes a jello sound when it's killed, the player will emit a pain sound when attacked. Again, nothing weird or out of the ordinary since it's a pretty simple concept.    - Gameplay :   2-D sidescrolling, using the WASD keys to move up, down, left and right. Since it's a sandbox game, there's lots of things to create. You will primarily be mining the blocks that compose the entire Terraria world you create in order to make items like armor and weapons or buildings. PVP is also included, but is restricted to online server use. There are bosses to defeat, NPCs to find, thousands of items to create or collect, miles upon miles of caverns to explore beneath the ground, and of course sky islands to explore. There is water, lava and honey. Terraria is all about exploring and combat, with creation being a minor, but still vital, part of the game."
41478867,english,1,105600,"A game developed and published by Re-Logic.  Terraria, an interesting title, where your imagination determines how far you can progress, and how much time you will pour into this game. A hollow world till you arrive, teeming with precious ores, and dark secrets. Fetid swamps and dry deserts.  This game is definitely an endeavour, and it will soak up alot of your time as you try and reach the pinnacle of your characters limitations and how much you can construct. Often remarked as a ""2D Minecraft"" I always find this comparison woefully incorrect. Minecraft has a wide selection of enemies, which is similar, A wide array of ore and precious gems to mine, which is also similar. But from then one, Terraria leaves it dead in the water. An RPG experience, with substantial boss progression, Active try and retry game mechanics and spanning character classes, All inclusive of a massive crafting system, and wide assortment of things to collect and try.  Anyways, I've praised it enough, lets get down to the review!  Graphics: Probably one of the weaker points of the game, Its still very vibrant and holds upto despite its 2011, Birthdate. This is mainly due to the pixelated graphics and 2D perspective of the game. Not alot to render, and not alot to process at any one time, Making it run very smoothly at any point in time, But also extremely limited due to there not being any sort of graphical options or benchmarks.  Gameplay: Where do i begin. This game plays, as well as you can play it. All the mechanics are there for you to make it work in your favor. But finding your niche and finding your work space is all crucial in you enjoying your time in Terraria. The game drops you into a world, where you basically don't understand anything, A very limited spread of understanding, very few tools at your disposal, and a single NPC to help guide you along your journey. 4 classes to basically choose from as you progress through the game, Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. All depending on how you want to play and how you prefer to play. Despite there being no relevant story or backstory to this game, there is a substantial amount of progression and ALOT of gear to rummage around for.  Story: I think i pretty much covered this aspect of the game already. There really isn't a story here. Which is usually a game killer for me. I heavily invest in story driven worlds, And this world has none to speak of. I guess the story can be made up for each player, as to why you are doing what you're doing, but as for a story driven narrative. There isn't one.  I don't often do a ""CONS"" section. But this game is so monstrous in terms of scope and size, I feel it's necessary to provide as much information as possible. I love this game to bits, this is perhaps the 3rd time i've played it through, Once on playstation, once on Xbox and now on PC. So i'm well aware of his rather frustrating flaws. So here we are.... Cons: This game despite how much effort has been poured into it, Has rather sizable and numerous flaws. Mostly relating around achievement glitches, game crashing and multiplayer bugs. Achievement glitches are fairly frustrating, although are entirely not a concern unless you're as OCD as i am. The game progresses the same way regardless of steams registering of your progress. Game crashes for alot of players at certain intervals in the game, Which HAS caused loss of character saves. It's highly recommended that you cloud save your favorite character builds and worlds, so that your save data will always be present. And Multiplayer as a whole is a fairly awful experience, the above mention bugs as well as an assortment of new things, Players not seeing what each other are seeing, Enemies and bosses despawning because of numerous players involved, which may or may not potentially ruin hours upon hours of preparation and planning. Frustrating to say the least. But alot of it is avoidable if you take necessary precautions. Alot of which can be found through quick internet searches.  Overall: This game is a gigantic time suck lol There is no other way to put it, You will pour time into boss by boss progression, farming and grinding enemies for specific gear to better improve your chances at the next boss. You will dig deep into dirt, mud and ash for hours upon hours just to find 3 pieces of ore which isn't even close to the amount you need. You will kill thousands of enemies for a single piece of gear, that isn't even optimal till you find another piece it can be fused with. You will die on the inside for days and potentially weeks as you farm your way to the very end of the game. And then when it's all over and you finally can get a breath of respite as your real life world is crumbling to pieces around you, You will feel empty, knowing that it's done. This game isn't just worth its price, It's worth every minute you pour into it. Welcome to Terraria. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do."
26677395,english,1,105600,"This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.  I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.  Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.  Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do.   There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!  Now this Game might not have the best ""graphics"" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way.   I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low! So just give it a shot!"

On the character/world selection page there are options ""play, favourite, move to cloud, rename"" just so you don't repeat my mistake pick move to cloud for world and characters you care about.  Besides that It's a fun game, once you get a basic hang of it. Learn how to build a house, move around the map fast, craft, find/summon bosses and you're good to go.   You can do as much or as little in this game as you want, you can challenge yourself with different world/character level of difficulties, there's also a journey mode that offers god mode/time manipulation/ítem duplication, It's basically a creative mode.   This game is a sandbox title with no story so play however you see fit.   This game has a lot to offer and despite putting in almost 100 hrs I feel like I still have a long way to go.  Reccomended to people looking for an addictive time sink game."

[/list] [hr][/hr][h2] 🎮Gameplay: [/h2][hr][/hr] Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with a focus on exploration, building, crafting, combat, survival, and mining, which is playable both in singleplayer and multiplayer modes.   The player begins in a randomly generated world with only basic tools to progress. In order to craft better tools, the player will need to mine the starter ores, such as iron and tin. As you gather these resources, you can build a house to protect yourself and make better tools and armor to fight the monsters that spawn at night.  Also, you should be searching for life crystals if you want to increase your max health, and you should be searching for fallen stars if you want to increase your max mana. Mana is the ""ammo"" you need for your magic wands and items that need mana.  Once you have built a house, you need to build houses for the NPCs to live in. The NPCs can sell you useful items for the money you receive from defeating enemies. There is also a guide NPC who can give you hints on what to do. You can also find NPCs around the world who need help, and when you help them, they can move into your house.   It is time to explore the world and go deep into the mines to find better ores, but be aware because there are traps and strong enemies in the mines. If you don't have the appropriate pickaxe, you won't be able to mine all the ores at first. As well as the mines, you will have to go through the different biomes you will find in the game. Both are generated randomly.  Various world events may occur that make the enemies stronger, such as the blood moon, slime rain, etc. These events usually happen at night.   By destroying a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart, a meteor will fall in your world, which you can mine to craft some useful items.  You can do a lot in Terraria whether you're bored or not. You can start a building project or do side missions that NPCs give you, etc. The game does not require much grinding, but it takes a while to mine enough ores.  I think that much of the game should be discovered by the players themselves, so I'll leave you with just this and hope that you'll want to get into this awesome 2D game called Terraria.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌲Biomes: [/h2][hr][/hr] There are several different biomes in the game, including the snow biome, jungle, desert, and more. There are also biomes underground that have secrets to be discovered. I won't tell you much about the biomes since exploring is part of the game, but I will say that the biomes are well designed and interesting to explore. In the mines, you will find chests with loot that could be very useful.   [hr][/hr][h2] 📄🎩Bosses and some facts: [/h2][hr][/hr] I won't tell you about the boss's abilities and such, because I think you should discover that for yourself as you progress.   The bosses spawn when you have the right item and do a certain action with it, such as throwing it into lava or clicking on it. You can also summon bosses by speaking with some NPCs. Different areas have their own bosses to face. The bosses are well thought out, and the difficult ones are the ones near the end of the game so you don't just defeat them all with the bad loot and complete the game with that. Prepare yourself with potions and good equipment if you are going to take on one of these bosses.  To progress in the game, you must defeat the bosses, because that will result in you getting more items and unlocking things in your world that you couldn't do before. This is a 16-bit style game, and I think it suits the game well.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌎👕Options of your world and character customization: [/h2][hr][/hr] It is possible to change some stuff in your Terraria world such as the seed, the size, difficulty. You can also decide if there will be corruption or crimson in your world.  Various customization options are also available, including clothing and clothing colors, hairstyles, eye colors, and more.   [hr][/hr][h2] 💭Final Thoughts: [/h2][hr][/hr] If you're looking for something to play for a while and you want to always have something to do, then Terraria is the game for you. It has an excellent soundtrack and great features. The bosses are challenging, and the game takes a long time to complete. Overall, the game is excellent.   Rating: 8/10"

In conclusion, Terraria is a game that has something for everyone. Its vast world, engaging combat, and creative potential make it a must-play for any fan of sandbox games.

34867907,english,1,105600,"I've put lots of time into this game, even before I bought it on Steam. When I did finally get it on Steam, I purchased two copies: one for myself, and one for my wife. We played together, helping each other collect health and mana upgrades, equipment upgrades, and collecting the NPCs. She fought off slimes and zombies while I established gardens for mushrooms, trees, and plants for potion ingredients. We mined, we explored dungeons and caves, we fought bosses and discovered how to navigate Hell.  It's been an amazing time, and this game has been well worth the amount of money I've spent on it. I've gotten more hours of enjoyment out of it, both alone and with my wife, than I have with nearly every $60 AAA game. The music, the graphics, the controls, and the amount of stuff available to do just make it an easy recommendation for me."

80101227,english,1,105600,"(it contain small spoilers what is ahead, skip this story if you just want to witness yourself and go directly to quick review section. Also I kinda had to update this review a little bit, minor fixing on my writing and maybe adding some more stuff for my story part.)  Terraria...  It's been over 9 years since it has been released on steam and perhaps still over 9 years since I got my hands on this pure gem.  When I first time saw this as pretty foolish person and thinking this being just ""2D Minecraft"" but thankfully I was completely wrong about it and getting really into this game.  Sure your first time playing this game might be so slow and boring, but once you get your hands on very interesting gears and meet very important people that sells even much more interesting stuff, then this game slowly starting to get some speed, also don't forget to build houses for them.  The first time when I was capable enough to take on the Wall of Flesh, I was very certain this was the final boss of the game, until for the surprise it unlocked the hardmode and I reacted by saying: ""I'm sorry what?""  Upon that moment I realized the adventure was just getting started, but eventually I was getting bored with the game even couple years later when I played with group of friends, it didn't take long until we decided to stop playing. Although I did enjoy the fun time in the game and I will never forget that time when I tricked someone to step on the pressure plate that was rigged with explosives.  Few years later I decided to check back in the game and wow how much it has been changed from and started to play again to see what new and exciting things to discover and this time I did play little bit longer.  On this time I felt it gave more content than enough for me to at least write down the review, but oddly enough it felt like it was missing something from all this so I decided not to make the review.  Upon this year near spring time, they announced upcoming perhaps truly final update for the game: ""Journey's End""  That update was a huge one when it arrived and I personally felt like it is finally time to finally finish this game on hardest possible difficulty, so I finally created my final character, my final world, readying my copper blade and getting almost instantly killed by green slime!   Yes...   it is that hard, but I decided to keep going even if it was going to drive me completely insane because of it, until on that moment when I soldiered on this pure madness, I finally was face to face with the official final boss of Terraria... The Moon Lord and boy how much tries it took until I was near only 3 HP left on my character before finally defeating it and it never felt so good when I saw it dying and seeing the credit rolling for the first time.  But...  Now I feel this adventure isn't just over yet, especially when they added new content and I now have a urge to conquer the master mode and something else from beyond.  Now for the actual review.   Goods  +Gameplay Gameplay of the game is very simple at first, but it steadily get harder when you find new tools, weapons and trinkets that give you new way to play the game and there are basically ""classes"" on the game, for example: warrior, summoner, archer/gunner and mage, there are more ""classes"" but you can make your own ""class"" by mixing up the armor, trinkets and others giving you chance to experiment every items what you find and what mostly suit your style.  +Art style The art style of the game is really pretty and all these years the art style has been improved quite a lot and especially the background since every area change the scenery and certain event affect the scenery as well, there are also lots of small details to see and some few changes on clouds as well.  +Music The music of this game is pure classic and all of them did have the tunes improved little bit and few news has been added after the journey's end update, there is also now otherworld version of ost that you can change it in the game after finding the certain secret.  +Price It's literally 10€ for several hours of fun and especially with friends.   Decents  =playtime You can easily sink great amount of time on either playing the game to end, crafting your perfect world or anything else, although if you just made completely new character and new world, the playtime might take quite a time until you get on the speed.  =Loot drop chance It might be little bit annoying to try getting the certain items from certain enemy, but there are few ways to make it easier.   Bads  -bugs/crashing I can't think of anything else being bad than bugged game or game crashing out of nowhere, but these are so rare you could just say: ""what bugs?""   Conclusion This game is pure classic since it was almost 10 years of it release on steam and this ""final"" update really show how much RE-Logic care about this game and it's fans, not only you get this great game pretty cheap, you also get lots of fun to explore the world, fighting powerful enemies, finding awesome treasures, build your own world and last but most importantly making your own story on this game on yourself or with your friends.  Welp, that's all for now.  Doktor Greenman, logging out."
172184787,english,1,105600,"Not often do I review games I enjoy, but the mindless wave of negative reviews has made me want to write SOMETHING.  Terraria is a game of passion, obvious from the decade the developers have spent updating and improving on the already-solid framework. It features some of the best 2-D combat I've ever experienced, a gorgeous art style, and a very satisfying progression.  All this is not to mention the countless high quality fan-made mods - Calamity, Thorium, and many others add dozens (if not hundreds) of extra hours of gameplay. The players are just as passionate about this game as the developers.  Most negative reviews (at the time of writing) don't criticize the game itself, rather the fact the devs don't share their political ideologies. It's disappointingly childish. While the game does have its flaws, don't look to these reviews for them right now.  If, by some off-chance, you are reading this and have never played the game, try it out! It may introduce you to a new favorite! Don't let the drama scare you off."
69858045,english,1,105600,"Objectively one of the most well-designed games on the market, right up there with Minecraft.  TL;DR for people who hate reading: game good, buy it.  Now, Terraria is often compared to Minecraft. However, these two games couldn't be more different. While both games share some similar mechanics, Minecraft has a heavy focus on creativity and survival, while Terraria has way more focus on combat depth and exploration. Lots of people call this game a ""sandbox game"", and I disagree with that. It's definitely more of a 2-D action RPG with sandbox elements. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to be comparing and contrasting this game with Minecraft, since everyone and their mother is familiar with it and most people are gonna come to Terraria thinking it's just 2D Minecraft.  So let's get into it, shall we? Minecraft has a straightforward gear progression system: Wood, Stone, Gold, Iron, Diamond, Netherite. Whereas Terraria has a very complex gear progression system that often gives you choices between gear sets. Gear and weapons are divided into different ""classes"": Ranged, Magic, Melee, and Summon. They're all equally viable, the only difference is that they all have different playstyles. Certain classes are better at certain fights than others, but in the end it all equals out. You won't even have access to all the gear sets or weapons in your first playthrough. This is because some of the ores and even biomes are randomly swapped out for something else entirely! For example, your world can either generate with Cobalt or Palladium, never both. So this gives the game tons of replay value if you want to experience everything, as different gear sets, weapons, and accessories often have different effects.  Minecraft has two bosses, whereas Terraria has somewhere around twenty, all with different mechanics and a huge variety of strategies with which you can use against them. Unlike Minecraft, building and crafting actually facilitates the combat. By that, I mean that you can build a dedicated arena complete with platforms, regen stations, mana regen stations, defense buffs, etc. to aid you in combat, and you can customize it to your needs. Do you want to automate the boss-killing process? You can do that. Defeating certain bosses also gives you access to new gear, places, and items. All of this gives the player a sense of progression, like they're always working towards something. There's also plenty of optional bosses, as well as random invasions that you can tackle. In Minecraft, the attitude is very ""do what you want"", which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Terraria's philosophy is just different. You can do what you want, but if you want to access a wider variety of blocks to build with or just want something a bit more challenging, that's what the progression system is for.  Next up are NPCs. Remember those Testificates in Minecraft that forced you to use a shoddy currency to buy low tier items for exorbitant prices? Well, Terraria does NPCs right. Terraria has a dedicated currency system unlike Minecraft (No, emeralds are not a dedicated currency system). This is your standard Bronze>Silver>Gold>Platinum MMO system. This currency is not mined, but is dropped from enemies. The NPCs in this game--and there are a lot of them--require you to build a house for them. Certain NPCs like/dislike certain biomes, and like/dislike certain neighbors. Each NPC has a unique function. For example, the Nurse will heal you to full health for a price, and the Clothier sells vanity items. Having two or more NPCs housed near each other will give you access to the pylon system, depending on how happy your NPCs are. Pylons are a teleport system designed to get you to house NPCs in several small villages throughout the world instead of all in one big base at your spawn point. Doing this will allow you to teleport to each of the villages you set up. This is a huge boon, because while the world isn't basically infinite like Minecraft's world, Terraria's worlds are still rather huge, and getting from point A to point B can be a really tedious task without these pylons.  Terraria also has a looming, omnipresent threat that creates a sense of urgency once you defeat a certain boss. These are the infectious biomes, the Corruption, the Crimson, and the Hallow. These biomes will begin to spread throughout the world, and if you let them run amok for too long, they may well consume your entire world. The Corruption and Crimson biomes are evil, and will always be dangerous and hostile environments. These evil biomes spread like a cancer, and NPCs won't live anywhere near them, forcing you to constantly build and move NPCs to new houses if something isn't done about it.  The Hallow in particular isn't necessarily an evil biome like the Corruption or the Crimson, but allowing it to spread rampant can lock access to various items and blocks that you would otherwise need to gain an edge over the next boss. You will need to employ various strategies to either keep these infectious biomes at bay, or eradicate them completely. In contrast, Minecraft is extremely laid back, with no sense of urgency. Again, Terraria and Minecraft are two very different games.  I could go on and on about the game's mechanics, but I've listed the main ones above. So, looking at the game objectively, here's my verdict. The character creation screen is sufficiently robust for the type of game that it is. You have multiple difficulty options, including Journey mode, which is a psuedo-creative mode with its very own progression system. The boss progression never gets too tedious and is always exciting whenever one spawns, as each one has a very different but heavy presence. The final boss is exceedingly challenging regardless of what difficulty you play on, which is honestly how it should be. After you complete progression on a world, you can start a sort of ""new game+"" in a new world, carrying over all your items and gear to the next if you so choose. I don't recommend this, as it basically breaks the game because difficulty does not scale with number of playthroughs on a single character, unless that's your thing. On a casual playthrough on a single world, it'll probably take you anywhere from 4 to 40 hours to beat, depending on what pace you like to go at. After that, you'll definitely want to play again and again. The pixel art is incredibly well done, especially with the recent overhaul. The music is some of my favorite in the video game industry, because it has such a unique personality. The community for this game is outstanding, and very alive. If you finished the game and want more out of it, Terraria does have mod support, so mod to your heart's content!  I really couldn't think of anything about this game that I disliked. I mean, one could argue that sometimes the bosses expect a bit too much from the player. Or maybe you'll just get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of items you're going to pick up if you're a packrat. But I honestly can't think of anything that is objectively bad about this game. So yeah, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone. My family and I play it together and everyone loves it.   Terraria recently released their latest and final patch ""Journey's End"" which added an obscene amount of content to the game! Re-Logic really treats their playerbase well, and I definitely look forward to what they have to offer in the future."

82815094,english,1,105600,"I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.  Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further.   Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime.   After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on.   With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.  I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me.   Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors.   Sincerely, Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen"

69306612,english,1,105600,"After playing the game since 2011 I have just realized I have never left a review.  Well... I have pirated the game and then I have bought game several times for myself, and several times as a gift for others. I have played the game solo, with friends, with my girlfriend and planning to introduce it to my daughters (who were born since the game launched). I have spent hundreds of hours on 1.0... hundreds of hours on 1.1... on 1.2... on  1.3... and planning to spend hundreds more on 1.4. I have built, fought, explored, created wild-life reservation worlds as well as apocalyptic wastelands...   So I guess, it's not that bad game after all."
32026626,english,1,105600,"Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10"
47798793,english,1,105600,"So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria:   - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements - It has an incredible amount of content to it - Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class) - Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy - A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight - Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now) - Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped!  - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore! - I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTING  Cons? Hmm.  - Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized! - Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though. - Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me. - Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game.   Other thought:  - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.  Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):  I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.  Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.  There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is.   I spent $10 on this."

80853945,english,1,105600,"This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a game, and I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offline, as well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years ago, I asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap, 10 US dollars at the time, which is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this game, as well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to download, I was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retro, and the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to time, ripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldn’t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the game, the music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own character, so many different styles and colours, so many choices and personalization’s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first character, and after that, I was set out into a mysterious world, filled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shuriken’s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hill, I had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every direction, and with demon eyes flying overhead, death was inevitable.  As soon as I respawned, my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventually, we held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay in, and that’s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building.   There are so sososososososo many blocks to build, hammer and axe together in intuitive, creative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for building, as the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing builds, and it only got better with each update. There was sloping blocks, paint, different walls, how each block melded together, how each block interacted with other blocks, the light sources, the different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform.   After I was done building my house, I set out to find more loot to plunder. That’s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for me, so the combat was less punishing then I’d like it to be, but the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfying, even hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculately, precariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which way, you have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think you’ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of fire, the game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.  The gameplay loop is a satisfying composition of combat, farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPC’s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boom, rare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the future, skipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the game, it has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the last, and it keeps pushing you forward, to the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straight, and I only got 1. I did other stuff in between, sure, but the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewarding, it is peaceful at times.  With the Journeys end update, the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftop, listening to the songs and watching my NPC’s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this game, its not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its community, from steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic game, and I could not recommend it more.  I absolutely adore this game, and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years.

76984308,english,1,105600,"[h1] 💻/📱 Description: [/h1] Terraria is among the BEST if not [b] the best [/b] game of this [b] decade, [/b] which surprises me considering its very low price. The content is beyond overwhelming with many bosses, challenges and options that you won’t ever get bored of. The game revolves around [b] you [/b] the player, as the difficulty and gameplay change depending upon your progression. The art style and music are very exceptional, bringing us the fanbase pleasant memories even to this day.  [h1] 📖 Setting: [/h1] [h3] Summary [/h3] Terraria is a land full of mystery and wonder. You the adventure are given the task to cleanse this magical world from the spreading [b] cancer [/b] called Hollow/Corruption. Many powerful beings will stand in your way, so grab some loot, find allies and restore the balance. Since many players forget the fact that Terraria includes a story in the first place. I suggest you read the lore from the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Lore] Wiki [/url] to get accustomed to the plot.  [h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1] Terraria refers to casual and hardcore players alike. You can slay forces or start creating buildings, without though being obliged to do so. The game offers a variety of blocks and items that encourage creativity. You can even build your mini-golf park! The goal here is to have fun and not just constantly grind for loot.  [h3] Difficulty [/h3] The actual Difficulty mode is a character set selected during character creation. There are 5 types of difficulty: Softcore, Mediumcore, Hardcore and the newly added [b] Journey [/b] mode that can only be played on journey worlds. All the above-mentioned modes change the penalty upon death.  [table] [tr] [th] Description[/th] [th] Difficulty [/th] [/tr] [tr] [td] Characters start with extra equipment [/td] [td] Journey [/td]  [/tr]  [tr]  [td] Characters drop [b] coins [/b] upon death [/td]  [td] Classic [/td]  [/tr]  [tr]  [td] Characters drop [b] items [/b] on death [/td]  [td] Mediumcore [/td]  [/tr] [tr]  [td] Characters cannot [b] respawn!! [/b]  [/td]  [td] Hardcore [/td]  [/tr]  [/table]  Another form of difficulty is [b] world modes. [/b] Those are separate settings that apply to the [b] world, [/b] rather than the [b] character. [/b] Players may choose between Journey, Classic, Expert, and Master mode when creating a new seed. Each mode provides more loot, as well as special accessories depending on the difficulty you have chosen. I advise [b] new [/b] players to start with the Classic mode, as Expert and Master are very demanding for a novice adventurer. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894347971 [h3] Starting your adventure [/h3] Terraria starts its gameplay slow and steady, as it should be. You begin your journey with only 3 tools (sword, axe, pickaxe) at your disposal and a companion useful for his crafting guides. It’s up to [b] you [/b] the player whether you want to challenge the game since your imagination, skill and creativity shape the word and thus the adventure. As a tip, I suggest you start building a small house in the beginning. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894343444 [h3] Interactive playstyle [/h3] Terraria forces [b] you [/b] the player to manipulate the environment to survive. You can chop trees used for crafting; mine rocks used for building or combine all the materials to cross large gaps etc. Physics plays a major role in the game’s playstyle, so do expect lots of deaths caused by [b] fall damage. [/b] There is also a small detail concerning nightfall, but that’s a surprise for you to explore. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894342641 [h3] Scaling [/h3] [b] Grinding [/b] Terraria is very famous for its grinding potential. There are many repeatable bosses, each offering different and unique [b] treasure bags [/b] that are considered valuable for your future encounters. Countless items offered by a specific boss or gained by certain activities, such as fishing, have a very low [b] drop percentage [/b]. This concept favours repeatability, so do be patient, as sometimes even the best things in life take a while.  [b] Classes [/b] There are 4 classes in Terraria: Magic, Ranged, Melee and Summoning. Each class requires different armour sets and weapons that provide unique stats and abilities, depending upon the material they were made from. It is most favourable to stick with 1 class during a playthrough, as this way you can aim your focus on specific items and equipment. Read the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Class_setups]Wiki [/url] and choose carefully which role to main first.  [b] Loot [/b] There are lots of accessories, mounts as well as vanity items with interesting [b] specialities [/b] that bring joy to competitive and creative players alike. A perfect example is the [b] Cloud in a Bottle [/b] which grants the user the ability to extra-jump midair. You can combine the accessories to create even stronger ones in the Tinkerer's Workshop. There are countless combinations, so take your time while reading the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Tinkerer%27s_Workshop]Wiki. [/url]   [h3] Wiki, Wiki and more Wiki [/h3] Overall, the experience is amazing, however, the learning curve is extremely demanding. This is a feature that does not go well with many players. As you have noticed above, you [b] will [/b] have to consult the [b] wiki [/b] regularly to truly master the game. Otherwise, you going to encounter many problems and difficulties that eventually will lead to confusion. Terraria is [b] very [/b] grind demanding game, so bring some friends in your journeys as co-op is more than encouraging!  [h1] 👁‍🗨 Visuals: [/h1] Terraria runs pretty well even on a [b] potato [/b] Pc. It is a small game with a gorgeous yet simple artstyle that continues to captivate me to this day. The game runs smoothly in low settings with minor loading times. In the rare case you encounter problems with performance, I suggest you turn off the effects.  [h1] 🎧 Audio: [/h1] Terraria’s music is [b] exceptional [/b] in its way. Every biome, boss as well as event has its unique song that fits the theme. I encourage you to buy [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/409210/Terraria_Official_Soundtrack/] Terraria: Official Soundtrack [/url] as it proves to be a piece of excellent background music to listen to. You also provide a small token of appreciation to the developers.  [h1] 🗃️ Side Notes: [/h1] Terraria is a challenging game for those who want to reach its completion. Before starting your adventure, I recommend you to get accustomed to terms like Pre-Hardmode - Hardmode mode etc. The game takes time to master, so do not get disappointed if you are struggling in the beginning. Be patient and most importantly have fun.  If you crave more challenges the [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/] tMoadLoader [/url] (available on Steam) will become your best friend, so why don’t you give it a try!!

They provide tips as well as tricks that prove very useful having them at your disposal :  •	[b] Chippy Gaming [/b] https://www.youtube.com/user/ChippyGaming  •	[b] Yrimir [/b] https://www.youtube.com/user/Yrimir  •	[b] Hero [/b] https://www.youtube.com/user/HERO  [h1] 📋 Verdict: [/h1] Having in mind its low price compared to the amount of content that it offers, I consider Terraria a gaming paradise for both creative and challenge thirsty players. It refers to all ages, as its unique gameplay encourages fun and creativity. You can build constructions, kill enemies, fight bosses, everything depends upon your playstyle. We are stealing a church!  I need to express my enormous gratitude to Re-Logic, as their sheer will and passion made this masterpiece relevant, with many updates and tweaks beloved by the community."
146636516,english,1,105600,"Terraria is old, very old... it had so many ""this is the final update"" updates that I lost count, the developers seem to just love it too much to let go (all of said upgrades of course completely free!)  The level of value delivered for this game is unbelievable, fun platforming, fun combat, fun exploration, it's a complete package of all things awesome that a 2d game can offer.  Not to mention how much you can extend your experience with mods and special seeds (added by the developers) that fundamentally change the game.  On top of that, re-logic (the makers of terraria) just decided to support Godot and FNA to help out other game developers hopefully achieve a similar level of success that they did... a true class act.  I bought terraria in all platforms I own, highly highly highly recommended, 10 bucks for THOUSANDS of hours for high quality fun is a steal"
16212660,english,1,105600,"This Indie sandbox game really has a little something for everyone. Whether you are into building, creating pixel art, PvP, PvE, this game has something for you!  Once you've made your character, you start off in the world of Terraria. Your first goal is survival. During the first day, you deal with pesky slimes while you gather the materials needed to build a shelter before nightfall. Once night comes, the undead swarm you. Are you resting safely in your new house, or are you forced to fight until daybreak?  If you thought slimes and undead were all you had to worry about in this world, you were wrong. Outlandish minions and deadly bosses await every turn, as you explore the many different environments in the world. Defeating them will reward you with new materials, weapons, armor, and even trophies to display.  Beware of the corruption, an environment native to Terraria, that slowly spreads, trying to shroud your world in darkness. Or, will your world contain the crimson? A festering landscape, oozing with blood and flesh that constantly tries to devour you. You will not be left defenceless against these horrors, however! You can work to purify the land to its original state.  In your travels, you will find resources that you can mine and gather. Combine them into powerful weapons and armor, or shape them into building blocks for new structures. As you grow and progress, NPCs will begin to flock to your buildings, offering you aid. You will even find some out in the world, waiting to be rescued.  Tunnel through the earth, or take wing and fly to the clouds. Purify or corrupt. Build or destroy. The world of Terraria is yours to explore, and mold into your image."

You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats. You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn. You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble.   It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there. It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination."
70407246,english,1,105600,"[h1]Terraria is a game I recommend everyone to own on Steam.   It consistantly goes on sale for $2.50, and this game offers dozens of hours of solid entertainment. [/h1]  To be completely honest, for years I did not like Terraria. The biggest problem with the game is you literally don't know what to do or how to progress in the game without looking up a guide on the Terraria Wiki, or by asking more experienced players. To me, I just find that as bad game design.  There could have been some sort of quest log that gave you some indication of what to do next, otherwise the beginning of the game becomes rather dull.  Moving on, once you do know what you are doing, the game becomes surprisingly more enjoyable as Terraria focuses on combat and boss encounters. Each boss is different from one another, and are actually challenging. The game limits you from getting better gear until a specific boss is defeated which keeps the challenge high throughout.  Apart from that, as you kill bosses new enemies and events will appear in the game unlocking a vast new variety of weapons, items, and equipment.   One thing I had not realized is the incredible amount of content Terraria offers. As soon as you think you are done with the game, it just keeps going with even more bosses, more grind for even better gear, and just so much new stuff as you go along. (be sure to keep checking the wiki to see what bosses are next and how to unlock them)   [b]It is very important that you play this game with a friend. Playing it solo is simply not as fun, especially considering the time investment.[/b]   General overview: + Loads of content + Fun combat system with a large variety of weapons, spells, and gear. + Lots of fantastic bosses + Very challenging + An ever-changing world with loads to explore + Great fun with friends + Very easy to host a server and game is very minimal on resources (meaning anyone with a PC can enjoy this, even on a laptop)  - Somewhat impossible to progress without a guide - The first half of the game is rather boring compared to the later half - A bit straining on the eyes with pixel graphics, especially with a high resolution monitor - A bit too challenging at times (especially playing solo) - Resources are limited, meaning you won't be able to get items without generating a new world (your character can move between worlds and servers)  [b]Highly recommend generating a medium to large world[/b]   To sum things up, Terraria is a fantastic game to play with at least one friend (preferably just 2-4 ). It offers an extremely high amount of content, lots of bosses, fun gameplay, lots to explore and craft, and its cheap!   +++ Highly recommend."

77993818,english,1,105600,"My first ever Steam game. Boy was it a great 8 years, or however long it was. Sadly, the journey has come to an end. We all knew this was coming, after 1.3 came with the true endgame it was only a few years' time for the finale.  Back when I first joined, I was a little guy. Started playing back in the 1.1 days. I learned the ropes, and I had a lot of fun. Most of my time was occupied by another childhood favorite, Minecraft, however I played this quite often too. I found a server, and started playing some minigames, meeting people, and fighting bosses with them. Those times were great.  Then came 1.2, a glorious time. I started my first true playthrough, as a ranger, and was determined to beat the Golem, which I did after some time. I ended up painting my entire spawn in negative colors because I was bored. Those were also fun times.  After that came 1.3, the endgame. I wasn't playing it much during this time, due to not being able to use a computer, but I played it and it was enjoyable nonetheless. I met more people, played more games, did more playthroughs, and I ended up getting into mods.  But eventually, things go as they come.  1.4 is a bittersweet update, to say the least. It made the game look so much better, and performed smoother overall too. The changes added were astronomical, but nothing truly game-changing, well except for Empress of Light. The new Master mode is okay, but it lost so much potential it could have had. x10 spawnrate is also fun, but I only put some 40 hours into that. Got pretty far, but it just got too strenuous, with school starting up and all too.  A game I once knew to be simply three mechanical bosses and some hallowed gear changed into the vibrant landscape it is today, but never to change anymore. It's one of many relics lost to time of my childhood, and one that will go in my mind as a great memory collection, yet not to be added to much more. I might play this game here and there, but it just isn't what it used to be.  May I wish you all good luck in your virtues, and hope you all have a great time, as I once did. Just don't get it get to your heart too much, otherwise it will pull hard."

150159381,english,1,105600,"I wanted to write this review after I spent enough time in the game and have gotten most of the achievements. So now that I’m about 109/115 achievements & 100 hours playtime, I feel I can finally give an adequate review.   I felt this game was hard to get into at the beginning but if you have someone help you through the first steps in learning the game play and crafting mechanics, it gets easier and more fun. It’s hard because at the start, you basically are some weak homeless dude and have to fight off slimes, collect and craft, materials build your own house before it gets dark (and pretty much do this for the entirety of the game but as you progress, you get to upgrade your gear and it gets easier). It sounds like a grind but it’s well-worth it. It’s somewhat satisfying to build yourself up from the beginning, from wood walls to the solar or vortex brick or something.   The coolest part of the game is the crafting and building aspects of it. There’s so many different types of materials, which you can make into various styles of brick or wall paper, even furniture (like balloon furniture). There’s so much customizability in how you can build your houses. There’s different environments or “biomes” so you build houses that are befitting of that specific biome and then you get NPC’s to move in. You can also collect weird paintings which you can decorate your houses with.    There’s different game modes too so if you want a challenge, you can play hardcore or if you just want to build, you can do journey mode which allows you to duplicate items so you don’t have to destroy your world mining it all. It’s one of those games where there’s no right way to play. Play how you want and play how you think is most fun.  The music and the scenery in the game is also very pleasant, so it’s a very nice chill relax game. It’s nice solo and coop. 10/10 would recommend.  [b]In brief, here's some aspects I loved about it:[/b]  [list]     [*] environment & character customization     [*] crafting, collecting, and building     [*] open world exploration of different scenic environments     [*] soundtrack (that corresponds with the biome)      [*] different game modes and difficulties     [*] adorable creatures throughout the biomes  [/list]   Notice, I didn't mention combat in my review. Eh, it's not my type of game combat wise but that's the beauty of this game. There's different game modes where you can choose what type of experience you want from the game. Some go for those hardcore challenge runs and I go for Journey mode because I love the buidling and crafting elements."

51279217,english,1,105600,"Terraria is one of the top rated games on steam. And honestly, it deserves it. I think this is a damn good game. I won’t say it’s a perfect game and there are certainly some things you should know before you buy it, but I will happily give it a recommend.  [u]Let Me Begin with What the Game is About and What Makes it Cool.[/u] You start out with a basic sword, axe, and pickaxe, in the middle of nowhere. You’re first step is to get wood and build a shelter to protect you from the zombies at night. Next you need to dig down and get ore to make better gear. So it’s 2d minecraft? Well it’s more than that, let me continue. You’ll need decent armor and weapons to fight the tougher monsters that live underground and to fight bosses.   Yep bosses. Bosses are one of the defining elements of this game. Bosses are big and imposing and they play this awesome adrenaline music when you summon them (a lot of the Terraria music is awesome btw). And there’s a huge variety of bosses too: There’s a floating eye that aggressively charges at you, there’s a big worm creature that breaks into smaller worms as you damage it, there’s an angry plant that can only be fought in the claustrophobic jungle, there’s a cult leader that summons mirages of itself and makes the game into a bullet hell with how many projectiles it spits out. Now bosses can be very punishing, but this is a building/crafting game, so you can build your own arena with platforms to jump on and walls to protect you from (some) attacks, or craft potions that boost your speed, health regen, armor, and damage. The fact that you can tackle bosses on your own terms in your own arena is one of the most interesting parts of the game and it really makes boss fights feel epic.   Killing bosses is the main way you progress through the game. Killing them gives you some kickass loot or lets you access a parts of the world where you can discover some more kickass loot. There’s a lot of loot in this game. And it’s some pretty cool loot too. You get staffs that call meteors down from the sky, fireball staffs, swords that shoot fireballs, machine guns, rocket launchers, different kinds of ammo to go in your guns, yo-yo’s (yo-yos are a really cool weapon), boomerangs, tools that summon monsters or turrets to fight for you, tools that let you jump real high (useful for dodging boss attacks), vehicles that let you move real fast, grappling hooks for going spelunking. The more bosses you kill and the further you progress, the more powerful and interesting the loot you get. Seriously, getting new loot just feels absolutely wonderful in this game.  So yeah, I would say mining, boss fighting, and collecting loot are the meat of the game, but there’s plenty of gravy too. Maybe you want to take a break from boss fighting and do some fishing so you can get a chainsaw fish and also some potion ingredients. Well then you probably want to create a few ponds throughout your world. And you’ll probably want to set up some minecart tracks or teleporters to get to your ponds quickly. Or maybe you want to set up a mushroom farm because mushroom are good for potions as well as crafting some late game armor. Well you’ll want to create several rows of dirt so the mushrooms have plenty of surface area to spawn on. And if you don’t want to harvest mushrooms manually you can set up a bunch of conveyor belts and wire so the mushrooms just fall down and come to you. Or maybe a part of your world is corrupt. Corruption spreads slowly so you may want to dig a trench around it to keep it quarantined, or you can buy a special gun that cleanses corruption outright. Or maybe you need a bunch of unicorn horns. You could go to the part of the world where unicorns spawn and kill them with your flaming yo-yo. Or you could dig a big pit and every time a unicorn come by it falls into the pit and dies because the pit is full of lava and spiky traps. This is a crafting game where enemies are just another crafting resource, so setting up a death pit to farm unicorns is a logical thing to do. There’s plenty of stuff to do in Terraria and plenty of ways to do it.   [u]And Now for the Parts of the Game You Might Not Find so Cool.[/u] First of all, the difficulty. Specifically, the bosses. Bosses will kill you. Bosses are tough. You can give yourself boosts with potions and armor, but dodging attacks is your best bet. And that can be very difficult when the boss charges rapidly at you or shoots a dozen balls of lightning at you. You will need to learn the attack patterns of bosses and you will need to train your reflexes. I mentioned bullet hell earlier, and I really do think this game has bullet hell elements. If you just can’t stand bullet hell games you probably want to avoid Terraria. (Since difficulty is a pretty subjective thing, you may want to look up a video review of Terraria and see some boss fights and combat for yourself.)  Another thing I want to mention is the sheer amount of stuff to learn. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Terraria wiki. It’s a crafting game, so you’ll need to look up crafting recipes as well as how to get ingredients. It’s also a game about fighting giant bosses, so you’ll need to know how to summon bosses and you’ll probably want to read some tips on making an arena. If you want to build a garden or fishing pond you’ll want to know when certain herbs bloom and how much water to put in your pond. For building more complex structures, you may want to look up tutorials on youtube (the game has gone through several updates though, so some youtube tutorials are out of date). Personally, I kinda enjoyed learning the game. I’d get some weird item in my inventory and immediately going to the wiki to see what I could do with it. But I realize not everyone wants to study a wiki while they play video games.   One of the interesting parts of the game is how it’s a building/fighting hybrid kind of game. And while that’s cool some of the time, it can be really annoying at other times. Say you’re underground building an arena to fight a boss, then a bat flies out at you, now you have to stop building and take out your weapon. So you kill the bat and try to get back to building, but another bat spawns and you have to kill that one too. The game literally has a formula where if it detects there aren’t any enemies near you it will spawn new enemies, so you will constantly have to fight off annoying enemies while you’re trying to build or mine. (I should mention that there are tools that help deal with enemy harassment, but you need to know how to get them, which reinforces my point that you need to read the wiki)   I don’t really like Terraria’s endgame. Most of the early and midgame consists of exploring, building, and crafting, with the occasional action-packed boss fight thrown in, which I like because it offers some nice variety. However the endgame is back-to-back combat. Fight a boss, then fight a bunch of minibosses, then fight another boss, then fight four living towers which spawn very fast very dangerous enemies, then fight another boss. For my first playthrough of this game I stopped playing when I got to the endgame because I just didn’t want to slog through all the fighting. Now, I actually like the combat and I liked fighting bosses throughout the game, but it’s a simple combat system and fighting loses some of its charm when you do it for too long.   So this review turned out longer than I expected. I guess I wanted to be thorough. When I first played this game I got pretty frustrated at times and I was prepared to toss out the game altogether. But then I got into it a bit more and learned the mechanics better and I actually really liked it. Despite its flaws, this is probably one of my favorite games ever."

67608782,english,1,105600,"Absolute classic. Whenever I play it feels like I'm progressing whether it be getting a new weapon, killing a boss or just building a really nice house for an NPC it always feels like I'm moving forward. Surprisingly, the game hasn't really seemed to show any signs of its age despite being almost 9 years old at this point. The music is fantastic especially during boss fights. Boss fights have a perfect challenge level when you do them with the intended gear and there are a whole lot of bosses to fight throughout the game. The game has a ""halfway point"" just when you start to feel established which really puts you back on your toes and creates an excellent dynamic without taking anything away from the player. Expert mode feels like a perfect challenge for people who have a lot of experience by adding new mechanics or just small buffs to each boss. Overall one of my favourite games of all time."
77589421,english,1,105600,"Not much to say, everyone knows this game, everyone loves this game. 9 years of free updates is unprecedented and the developers are top tier for sticking with community this long.

83377962,english,1,105600,"[spoiler]Since I don't know English very well, I apologize for my mistakes.[/spoiler]  Most likely, my review will remain in the shadows, and hardly anyone will reach the end of my review, I still want to share with you my feelings and the seasoned spirit of adventure. It all started many years ago, when I got acquainted with one of the most wonderful, warm, and memorable games in my life - Terraria. When pronouncing this word, I immediately feel warm in my soul, I remember the wonderful soundtrack and completely immerse myself in my thoughts. Before reviewing, I immediately want to note that this game gave me a new perception of computer games, and gave me a great childhood.  I myself am not an ordinary player in Terraria, and there are few such oldies, because I got acquainted with Terraria even before its release, or more precisely, before the official release of the game on Steam (May 16, 2011). And although I have played 200 hours of this game in my Steam, I actually played it for about 1000 hours. When I was little, I, like all children, played Minecraft, and I really liked this game, I thought that I could not find a better game. But one fine day, my dad came home from work and told me about Terraria, which just appeared. Another employee told Dad about the game, and another employee told this employee, and then I don't know the story of the spread of rumors about a brand new freshly baked Terraria. When I first started the game, I created my character, spending several hours on it, pressed the button to create a world, and found myself on the ground. Someone walked next to me, his name was Guide, who first fell into the abyss ... I don't know why he did it, but it didn't really bother me. The first thing I learned was how to walk, jump and dig, and it was incredibly fun! After that I dug a hole for myself, buried myself on top and went to play Minecraft ... Don't judge strictly, but for a child then Minecraft was much more colorful, and had a 3D view, and not a cropped 3D space along the Z axis. But a couple of days later I went back in into the game, and again continued to explore the world, the game did not cause as much enthusiasm for me as many people who have started playing quite recently. And I don't know if it's good that I started playing such a raw game. But as time went on, I studied the world of Terraria more and more. I got to know cute teardrop-mongers and creatures that were constantly killing me. I realized that I needed a home to live, and that's when I discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of all the games I've played - building. So I gave up traveling and started BUILDING and DIGGING! And then this game completely sucked me in. I quit Minecraft and started DIGGING, KILLING, AND EXPLORING. I met new residents who can SELL! And a nurse who can CHOOSE! I also realized that the Guide is not a useless piece of garbage, and that you can have a heart-to-heart talk with him. In the end, I killed the ominous Eye of Cthulhu, which sowed fear, and the game ended there ... But soon new updates came out, I downloaded new versions and went all over again. And it was interesting. I went through each update, and did not get a mental pleasure. Since I like everything more difficult, I started playing the game on the Expert Advisor, and later on the Master. But all this was not enough for me! And I started to go through mods, for those who know Calamity mod, I went through this game with Revenge and Death modes, and also after a few hundred attempts I went through Boss Rush. Then I lost my nerves.  With each update, the game brought new emotions and a colorful world to the players and me. Every progress you make is much more satisfying than the last one and continues to push you forward, to the point where you don't stop. There is no point in talking about old versions, so I'll tell you a couple (hundreds) of words about the new Terraria.  For me this game became a home in which I felt comfortable. The game is currently in the game about 500 varieties of mobs. There are also 19 bosses and 13 mini-bosses, as well as 3 additional bosses in the mobile version. And from listing recipes you can break your tongue. Sloped blocks, paints, different walls were added to the game, each block merged together, each block interacted with other blocks. Light sources, different platforms that you may have used. All of this and more meant that anything imaginable could be built. Many people create amazing mechanisms and worlds, better than on paper!) Although they made a convenient interface for creating my character in the game, I also devote a lot of time to creating a character). And the music and style of play makes me crazy. I bought this game for my every account, and made all my friends, no matter if it was voluntary, to purchase this masterpiece. And if you are thinking whether to buy this game, I can hardly answer you ... YES !!! This game is amazing both solo and when playing with friends! You can catch hares and then fill the whole world of your friend with them! It's worth buying for this!  I can confidently say that Terraria has become my corner of safety, this is my home, there is no place easier and quieter than it.  Thanks Andrew Spinks, Whitney Spinks ❤ Thanks Re-Logic ❤ Thanks Terraria ❤ Thanks for reading ❤"

It's very relaxing to just take care of your world, and if you want some excitement, there are plenty of enemies lurking above as well as below ground.

105945973,english,1,105600,"The amount of labor, love, and time that the developers have spent fine-tuning and improving this game is truly astounding. With over 5000 items, 28 bosses and minibosses, easy multiplayer access, and mod support all wrapped up into a $10 bundle with no extra microtransactions or DLC, Terraria is a masterpiece that large-scale game companies could only dream of making. A single playthrough can easily last you over 30+ hours, for most, that is barely the tip of the iceberg.  This is a game that you can play and replay multiple times and still discover new items and mechanics with each playthrough. Every new world is a new adventure, a new place for creativity, an escape from reality to let your inner imagination run loose. Nothing pushes or pressures you to rush through the game, it is a self-paced journey that, despite the many labels put onto it, has no real end. Some people play the game to find new items and accessories, others play to build the ideas that live in their minds, but no matter how you decide to play the game, there is something for everyone to enjoy. Relogic called the 1.4 update “Journey’s End,” but I think that, even now, it is just the beginning.  In addition to all of this, the multiplayer in this game is absolutely phenomenal. Playing, chatting, and enjoying the game with friends is an incredible experience*. The pacing of the game barely changes compared to single-player and the atmosphere and ideas that can run through your world can be incredible. Access to the steam workshop, a place where you can share your creations or see the creations of others, is also a great addition to the game**.   Unfortunately, no game can be perfect in every way, I do have a few minor issues with the game.  RNG: Most items in Terraria are commonly available throughout the game. However, a very select few are very Rng dependent and can often feel like a chore to grind for. Fortunately, most of these items are entirely optional such as the information accessories and some late-game boss drops. Summoner Class: There are 4 main fighting classes in the game, Melee, Ranger, Mage, and Summoner. The latter is a unique class that uses minions to fight for you. This is a fantastic concept, but it is very poorly executed due to the lack of variety of summoner weapons and armor. Master Mode is a new difficulty in Terraria that was added in the 1.4 update, which increases the difficulty of the game by tripling the monster’s health and damage… that’s it. Other than a few extra cosmetic items, Master Mode is simply Expert Mode but with more enemy health. It doesn’t add anything new or interesting so it is usually best to just avoid it unless you are into that type of gameplay.  These are very minor flaws with the game and absolutely do not impact the overall gameplay or enjoyability at all. Terraria is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have had, the time I spent playing by myself and friends during the lockdown was definitely time well spent. If you are someone who enjoys building games, combat of all types, exploration, or just want a game that is a mixture of all of these, then I definitely recommend buying this game. If Relogic had made the updates cost money, then I absolutely would have paid, and the fact that they continue to add free updates to this game 10 years after its release just goes to show how much they care about their player and fanbase, and that is absolutely something I am willing to support.   * If you plan to start a multiplayer world with more than two people, I highly recommend playing on an expert mode world because of the modified boss drops. If you play on a normal world, then you will get boss drops equivalent to the boss drops of single-player, whereas an expert world’s boss drops are equivalent to the number of players on the world.   ** Terraria also has fantastic mod support, with the developers at Relogic just recently updating TModLoader to 1.4, and though I have never played modded Terraria, I have heard fantastic things about all kinds of community creations.   TL;DR  Good game, you should buy"

112310637,english,1,105600,"As someone who's over 1800 hours in, I can tell you with confidence that this game is a MASTERPIECE.  There are A LOT of things I could say about Terraria, but put quite simply: it's worth every penny.  The bosses are a blast, each class is fun in their own unique way, Expert difficulty is perfection (Normal is too easy and you get less loot; don't ever play on Normal), even the NPCs all have their uses!  Technically speaking, an NPC is only ever useless depending on your class or personal preference (e.g. some people may not care for the Angler achievements, or a mage might not care for the Arms Dealer, etc.).  You will always have something to do, at pretty much any given point in the game.  And even when you've 'beaten' the game and gotten bored of your world, you could just make a new character, new world, and have a totally new experience!  Then, even if you get bored of that, you can download tModloader for FREE, and mod the game to your hearts' content!  It's affordable, can run on most hardware, and is, dare-I-say, the perfect gaming experience.  I can't recommend this game enough."

It is simplistic enough to jump right into and yet at the same time, complex enough to keep one playing for years and years. The three pillars of the game are Building, Fighting, and Exploring. You have your own little (or not so little) world that is chock full of loot enemies and unique environments for you to kill and build yourself while doing the same to your planet. Good enemies: as varied as the freckle patterns on a persons face fun loot: There are six buttloads of stuff to shoot, slash, equip, or throw. (or explode) Blocks: for the crafty, theres a bunch of different blocks... (like if you though minecraft had a lot of blocks...) Bosses: you keep thinking how am I ever gonna be strong enough to beat that.

71383430,english,1,105600,"I would like to start off this review by saying one thing. This is one of the best games ever made. Now, most people would probably look at this game and think it's just 2D Minecraft, but it is so much more than that. The main similarities are in the blocks and survival aspects of it. But beyond that Terraria is just so much more.  Summary:  Gameplay - [9] When you start a world for the first time it is a very slow game, but the game quickly picks up the pace. There is no hand-holding in this game whatsoever, you have to do everything yourself or check the Terraria wiki page. You change a lot during your adventure and in the end the game is very fast-paced.  Soundtrack - [10] The soundtrack is some of the best I've ever heard in a sandbox game. It's so simplistic yet so good. It is very catchy and I will never forget the iconic song Overworld Day which is instantly recognized.  Graphics - [10] Since it isn't aiming for realistic graphics you really cannot give it a bad score. It's a very specific kind of art style that fits the game very well.  Price - [10] The price is incredibly cheap compared to what you get. You get a really long game with a bunch of replay value. It costs 9,99€ on Steam but often goes down to 4.99€ during sales. It's a great price.  In conclusion: Terraria is a fantastic game that has everything you would ever want in a game like this. You should really buy this if you want a really good sandbox game. The developers have been supporting this game for years now and still have 1 last update left called Journey's End. Thanks for reading this review."

Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.  But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts)."

64747184,english,1,105600,"For everyone saying this is a 2D Minecraft, you're wrong. This game has a lot of stuff to offer. Different kind of bosses, unique items, an adventure u WILL NEVER forget, Terraria."
38067494,english,1,105600,"This is one of the best games ever made and the only reason it is not regarded as such is that it is not very accessible. I can imagine many critics have started Terraria, played for some hours trying to figure it out, and put it away. Very often, critics have drawn misguided conclusions that Terraria resembles Minecraft (or is a Minecraft clone), but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Terraria is a procedurally generated sandbox survival metroidvania. Learning curve is steep, the game is hard and often requires you to consult to wikis and guides (even more so than the Souls series) but once you gain control of the game mechanics, you will find a very deep, hard core gem. Don’t let its eye-candy graphics fool you…  You are dropped into a world surrounded by many dangers. Initially, you are expected to make your first shelter, first weapon and just survive. This is the very core of the whole game. In order to beat stronger creatures, you need better weapons for which you need better crafting material. To get better crafting material, you need to mine deep into the earth, which leads you to find secret chests, face gazillion creatures including “bosses”. Boss fights not only require skill, but also need you to have the weapons, armors, potions, items necessary to beat them. Last, but not the least, there are plenty of events such as Halloween, Christmas, Pirate Invasion etc. with their own unique bosses and loots.  While you are working on mining for better tools, armors, weapons to be able to beat stronger enemies, you also need to keep expanding your “shelter”. A chair, ceiling and door is not sufficient any longer. You need to keep building new rooms to have room for new crafting centers and chests (for inventory). Every new room invites a new NPC to your shelter who can be crucial in your quest to beat the world of terraria, whether they sell unique items or provide healing.  Being a true sandbox game, you can also ignore progression and spend hundreds of hours just building. Your limit to what you can build and how you can customize it is your imagination. People at Terraria subreddit still manage to amaze me with their creativity and sometimes totally mind-blowing architecture.   Whether you choose to play it as a metroidvania or as a sandbox 2d Minecraft, you will love Terraria. In my opinion, it is one of the best games ever made.  [b]PS:[/b] Buy it full price. Developers are still updating content and supporting the game after all these years (without any paid DLCs whatsoever), they really deserve some support.  [b]10/10[/b]"
88490547,english,1,105600,"I've been playing this game since 2014 (on and off obviously) and after journey's end I have to review it just to say the sheer quantity and quality of content in this game is incredible. If you somehow haven't played terraria yet you really should. There is more or less something for everyone, and while it's very fun in single player, especially if you're more into building and collecting items, it's so much more fun with other people.

7877530,english,1,105600,"Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the ""crafting"" genre seriously. These were my first impressions.  However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!).   The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!  There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!  Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).  If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years)."
2092948,english,1,105600,"Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft. And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends."
57972609,english,1,105600,"""omG iTs jUsT 2dEE mInEcRafT!"" is the only thing I hear as a Terraria player, and I have to say that that is completely and utterly wrong. The game is great once you get into it but I think the reason it is so underrated is because the beginning of the game is a bit lacking. People just start up a world, chop down a tree or die to a slime or something and get bored. With Terraria you have to be patient. The game is difficult and a bit unforgiving at times but with the sheer amount of places to explore and items to find I personally think it's an amazing game. The best part about the game in my opinion is the music. I unironically listen to Terraria music sometimes it's that good. Anyway, I'm gunna go play some Terraria now. Bye!"
32842453,english,1,105600,"Lets get into it shall we   Terraria, the game that makes you question your life choices more than a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book on existentialism. I've spent more time in this pixelated wonderland than I have in the real world, and let me tell you, I regret nothing. My therapist might disagree, but what does she know about the joys of defeating pixelated bosses and building houses for NPCs who can't even say ""thank you""?  With over 1200 hours logged, I can confidently say that Terraria is not just a game; it's a way of life. Forget sunshine and fresh air; I've got mushrooms and glowing ore to keep me company. Who needs friends when you have a loyal army of NPCs, each with their unique quirks and questionable fashion sense?  The variety in this game is mind-boggling. I mean, where else can you go from fighting a gigantic eye to crafting a rainbow gun that shoots unicorns? It's like a fever dream mixed with a dash of pure, unadulterated awesomeness. Terraria is the only place where you can go from feeling like a badass ninja to a master chef whipping up delicacies for your digital neighbors.  Speaking of neighbors, those NPCs are a special bunch. They move in, mooch off your hospitality, and somehow manage to get themselves killed by zombies every other night. It's like living in a retirement home for video game characters, and I love it. Who wouldn't want a nurse, a wizard, and a gun-slinging arms dealer as roommates?  The building aspect of Terraria is like playing with virtual Legos, only better. Sure, you could build a modest little house, but why stop there when you can create a floating island with a disco floor and lava waterfalls? My creativity knows no bounds, and neither does the game's ability to let me indulge in my architectural fantasies.  Terraria is the only game that has me questioning whether I've been spending too much time in the real world. Why go outside when I can explore the vast reaches of the underworld, battle mythical beasts, and collect rare artifacts? The real world doesn't have pixelated penguins, and that's a deal-breaker for me.  In conclusion, Terraria is not just a game; it's a lifestyle. I highly recommend it to anyone who values creativity, exploration, and the ability to ignore real-world responsibilities. With 1200+ hours under my belt, I can confidently say that Terraria is the reason my plants are dead, my dog is hungry, and my social life is practically nonexistent. And you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. Five stars, two thumbs up, and a digital high five to the developers for creating this masterpiece. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dungeon to raid and a virtual pet to feed."

In the beginning, farming wood and my first ore the game felt kinda slow, but once I looted some chests in the underground bioms and got some movement items for faster running or double jumps I was hooked for it. I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun.   I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime.   Do I recommend this game? Yes! Absolutely!

42230477,english,1,105600,"People always love to make the comparision of Terraria and Minecraft. If you ever played this game, you'll know that they shouldn't be compared. In fact, for a single player experience, i'd say Terraria beats Minecraft hands down. But this isn't about Minecraft, so i'll list a few things as to why Terraria is great. Terraria is for those who love the idea of growing and becoming stronger the more you play. In the beginning, you're pretty much helpless, killing the weakest enemies in multiple hits. You move slugglishly, and minor heights and caverns are truly intimidating. In the end, you are a force to be reckoned with, capable of taking down hoards of enemy after enemy mithout even pressing a button - diving to the deepest parts of the world and traversing every terrain with ease.  The change is gradual, and each challenge is tougher than the last. But if you're up for the grind - and its a fun one at that - then Terraria is for you."
49808465,english,1,105600,"At first, this game may seem babyish: with an axe swinging all the way around and a sword looking little less than a porridge stirrer. You have a world, you can flourish and prosper but it is also a dangerous, hostile and menacing environment.   You create your first house: with a chair, table, walls and a background made from supposedly wood.  You create your armour and a new sword and you set of in your quest for salvation. Later on, you gear up; and fight your first boss.   It gets harder over time and you have more and more responsibilities to keep your world on its feet, and don't let the bad thing happen..."
88734962,english,1,105600,"Terraria: Sand Is Overpowered  - Graphics :   2-D vibrant graphics with block-like textures and a ""washed"" look. No HD, ultra-high settings. Just plain old sprites with 2-D.    - Sound :   Electric-type soundtrack. It's a bit unique since it sounds completely original and could almost be classified as something new. Soundtrack aside, all of the items and enemies and humans sound believable. Laser guns have a laser sound, a slime enemy makes a jello sound when it's killed, the player will emit a pain sound when attacked. Again, nothing weird or out of the ordinary since it's a pretty simple concept.    - Gameplay :   2-D sidescrolling, using the WASD keys to move up, down, left and right. Since it's a sandbox game, there's lots of things to create. You will primarily be mining the blocks that compose the entire Terraria world you create in order to make items like armor and weapons or buildings. PVP is also included, but is restricted to online server use. There are bosses to defeat, NPCs to find, thousands of items to create or collect, miles upon miles of caverns to explore beneath the ground, and of course sky islands to explore. There is water, lava and honey. Terraria is all about exploring and combat, with creation being a minor, but still vital, part of the game."
41478867,english,1,105600,"A game developed and published by Re-Logic.  Terraria, an interesting title, where your imagination determines how far you can progress, and how much time you will pour into this game. A hollow world till you arrive, teeming with precious ores, and dark secrets. Fetid swamps and dry deserts.  This game is definitely an endeavour, and it will soak up alot of your time as you try and reach the pinnacle of your characters limitations and how much you can construct. Often remarked as a ""2D Minecraft"" I always find this comparison woefully incorrect. Minecraft has a wide selection of enemies, which is similar, A wide array of ore and precious gems to mine, which is also similar. But from then one, Terraria leaves it dead in the water. An RPG experience, with substantial boss progression, Active try and retry game mechanics and spanning character classes, All inclusive of a massive crafting system, and wide assortment of things to collect and try.  Anyways, I've praised it enough, lets get down to the review!  Graphics: Probably one of the weaker points of the game, Its still very vibrant and holds upto despite its 2011, Birthdate. This is mainly due to the pixelated graphics and 2D perspective of the game. Not alot to render, and not alot to process at any one time, Making it run very smoothly at any point in time, But also extremely limited due to there not being any sort of graphical options or benchmarks.  Gameplay: Where do i begin. This game plays, as well as you can play it. All the mechanics are there for you to make it work in your favor. But finding your niche and finding your work space is all crucial in you enjoying your time in Terraria. The game drops you into a world, where you basically don't understand anything, A very limited spread of understanding, very few tools at your disposal, and a single NPC to help guide you along your journey. 4 classes to basically choose from as you progress through the game, Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. All depending on how you want to play and how you prefer to play. Despite there being no relevant story or backstory to this game, there is a substantial amount of progression and ALOT of gear to rummage around for.  Story: I think i pretty much covered this aspect of the game already. There really isn't a story here. Which is usually a game killer for me. I heavily invest in story driven worlds, And this world has none to speak of. I guess the story can be made up for each player, as to why you are doing what you're doing, but as for a story driven narrative. There isn't one.  I don't often do a ""CONS"" section. But this game is so monstrous in terms of scope and size, I feel it's necessary to provide as much information as possible. I love this game to bits, this is perhaps the 3rd time i've played it through, Once on playstation, once on Xbox and now on PC. So i'm well aware of his rather frustrating flaws. So here we are.... Cons: This game despite how much effort has been poured into it, Has rather sizable and numerous flaws. Mostly relating around achievement glitches, game crashing and multiplayer bugs. Achievement glitches are fairly frustrating, although are entirely not a concern unless you're as OCD as i am. The game progresses the same way regardless of steams registering of your progress. Game crashes for alot of players at certain intervals in the game, Which HAS caused loss of character saves. It's highly recommended that you cloud save your favorite character builds and worlds, so that your save data will always be present. And Multiplayer as a whole is a fairly awful experience, the above mention bugs as well as an assortment of new things, Players not seeing what each other are seeing, Enemies and bosses despawning because of numerous players involved, which may or may not potentially ruin hours upon hours of preparation and planning. Frustrating to say the least. But alot of it is avoidable if you take necessary precautions. Alot of which can be found through quick internet searches.  Overall: This game is a gigantic time suck lol There is no other way to put it, You will pour time into boss by boss progression, farming and grinding enemies for specific gear to better improve your chances at the next boss. You will dig deep into dirt, mud and ash for hours upon hours just to find 3 pieces of ore which isn't even close to the amount you need. You will kill thousands of enemies for a single piece of gear, that isn't even optimal till you find another piece it can be fused with. You will die on the inside for days and potentially weeks as you farm your way to the very end of the game. And then when it's all over and you finally can get a breath of respite as your real life world is crumbling to pieces around you, You will feel empty, knowing that it's done. This game isn't just worth its price, It's worth every minute you pour into it. Welcome to Terraria. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do."
26677395,english,1,105600,"This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.  I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.  Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.  Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do.   There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!  Now this Game might not have the best ""graphics"" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way.   I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low!

Besides that It's a fun game, once you get a basic hang of it. Learn how to build a house, move around the map fast, craft, find/summon bosses and you're good to go.   You can do as much or as little in this game as you want, you can challenge yourself with different world/character level of difficulties, there's also a journey mode that offers god mode/time manipulation/ítem duplication, It's basically a creative mode.   This game is a sandbox title with no story so play however you see fit.   This game has a lot to offer and despite putting in almost 100 hrs I feel like I still have a long way to go.

[/list] [hr][/hr][h2] 🎮Gameplay: [/h2][hr][/hr] Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with a focus on exploration, building, crafting, combat, survival, and mining, which is playable both in singleplayer and multiplayer modes.   The player begins in a randomly generated world with only basic tools to progress. In order to craft better tools, the player will need to mine the starter ores, such as iron and tin. As you gather these resources, you can build a house to protect yourself and make better tools and armor to fight the monsters that spawn at night.  Also, you should be searching for life crystals if you want to increase your max health, and you should be searching for fallen stars if you want to increase your max mana. Mana is the ""ammo"" you need for your magic wands and items that need mana.  Once you have built a house, you need to build houses for the NPCs to live in. The NPCs can sell you useful items for the money you receive from defeating enemies. There is also a guide NPC who can give you hints on what to do. You can also find NPCs around the world who need help, and when you help them, they can move into your house.   It is time to explore the world and go deep into the mines to find better ores, but be aware because there are traps and strong enemies in the mines. If you don't have the appropriate pickaxe, you won't be able to mine all the ores at first. As well as the mines, you will have to go through the different biomes you will find in the game. Both are generated randomly.  Various world events may occur that make the enemies stronger, such as the blood moon, slime rain, etc. These events usually happen at night.   By destroying a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart, a meteor will fall in your world, which you can mine to craft some useful items.  You can do a lot in Terraria whether you're bored or not. You can start a building project or do side missions that NPCs give you, etc. The game does not require much grinding, but it takes a while to mine enough ores.  I think that much of the game should be discovered by the players themselves, so I'll leave you with just this and hope that you'll want to get into this awesome 2D game called Terraria.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌲Biomes: [/h2][hr][/hr] There are several different biomes in the game, including the snow biome, jungle, desert, and more. There are also biomes underground that have secrets to be discovered. I won't tell you much about the biomes since exploring is part of the game, but I will say that the biomes are well designed and interesting to explore. In the mines, you will find chests with loot that could be very useful.   [hr][/hr][h2] 📄🎩Bosses and some facts: [/h2][hr][/hr] I won't tell you about the boss's abilities and such, because I think you should discover that for yourself as you progress.   The bosses spawn when you have the right item and do a certain action with it, such as throwing it into lava or clicking on it. You can also summon bosses by speaking with some NPCs. Different areas have their own bosses to face. The bosses are well thought out, and the difficult ones are the ones near the end of the game so you don't just defeat them all with the bad loot and complete the game with that. Prepare yourself with potions and good equipment if you are going to take on one of these bosses.  To progress in the game, you must defeat the bosses, because that will result in you getting more items and unlocking things in your world that you couldn't do before. This is a 16-bit style game, and I think it suits the game well.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌎👕Options of your world and character customization: [/h2][hr][/hr] It is possible to change some stuff in your Terraria world such as the seed, the size, difficulty. You can also decide if there will be corruption or crimson in your world.  Various customization options are also available, including clothing and clothing colors, hairstyles, eye colors, and more.   [hr][/hr][h2] 💭Final Thoughts: [/h2][hr][/hr] If you're looking for something to play for a while and you want to always have something to do, then Terraria is the game for you. It has an excellent soundtrack and great features. The bosses are challenging, and the game takes a long time to complete. Overall, the game is excellent.   Rating: 8/10"
137451762,english,1,105600,"Terraria is a game that has stood the test of time and continues to captivate players with its unique blend of exploration, combat, and creativity. This 2D sandbox game has been a favorite among gamers since its initial release in 2011, and it's easy to see why.  The game offers a vast and dynamic world to explore, filled with a variety of biomes, enemies, and treasures to discover. From the underground depths of the earth to the heights of the sky, there's always something new and exciting to uncover.  But Terraria isn't just about exploring - it also offers a robust combat system that will challenge even the most seasoned players. With an array of weapons, armor, and accessories to choose from, players can tailor their playstyle to suit their preferences and take on the game's bosses with confidence.

In conclusion, Terraria is a game that has something for everyone. Its vast world, engaging combat, and creative potential make it a must-play for any fan of sandbox games.

34867907,english,1,105600,"I've put lots of time into this game, even before I bought it on Steam. When I did finally get it on Steam, I purchased two copies: one for myself, and one for my wife. We played together, helping each other collect health and mana upgrades, equipment upgrades, and collecting the NPCs. She fought off slimes and zombies while I established gardens for mushrooms, trees, and plants for potion ingredients. We mined, we explored dungeons and caves, we fought bosses and discovered how to navigate Hell.  It's been an amazing time, and this game has been well worth the amount of money I've spent on it. I've gotten more hours of enjoyment out of it, both alone and with my wife, than I have with nearly every $60 AAA game. The music, the graphics, the controls, and the amount of stuff available to do just make it an easy recommendation for me."

80101227,english,1,105600,"(it contain small spoilers what is ahead, skip this story if you just want to witness yourself and go directly to quick review section. Also I kinda had to update this review a little bit, minor fixing on my writing and maybe adding some more stuff for my story part.)  Terraria...  It's been over 9 years since it has been released on steam and perhaps still over 9 years since I got my hands on this pure gem.  When I first time saw this as pretty foolish person and thinking this being just ""2D Minecraft"" but thankfully I was completely wrong about it and getting really into this game.  Sure your first time playing this game might be so slow and boring, but once you get your hands on very interesting gears and meet very important people that sells even much more interesting stuff, then this game slowly starting to get some speed, also don't forget to build houses for them.  The first time when I was capable enough to take on the Wall of Flesh, I was very certain this was the final boss of the game, until for the surprise it unlocked the hardmode and I reacted by saying: ""I'm sorry what?""  Upon that moment I realized the adventure was just getting started, but eventually I was getting bored with the game even couple years later when I played with group of friends, it didn't take long until we decided to stop playing. Although I did enjoy the fun time in the game and I will never forget that time when I tricked someone to step on the pressure plate that was rigged with explosives.  Few years later I decided to check back in the game and wow how much it has been changed from and started to play again to see what new and exciting things to discover and this time I did play little bit longer.  On this time I felt it gave more content than enough for me to at least write down the review, but oddly enough it felt like it was missing something from all this so I decided not to make the review.  Upon this year near spring time, they announced upcoming perhaps truly final update for the game: ""Journey's End""  That update was a huge one when it arrived and I personally felt like it is finally time to finally finish this game on hardest possible difficulty, so I finally created my final character, my final world, readying my copper blade and getting almost instantly killed by green slime!   Yes...   it is that hard, but I decided to keep going even if it was going to drive me completely insane because of it, until on that moment when I soldiered on this pure madness, I finally was face to face with the official final boss of Terraria... The Moon Lord and boy how much tries it took until I was near only 3 HP left on my character before finally defeating it and it never felt so good when I saw it dying and seeing the credit rolling for the first time.  But...  Now I feel this adventure isn't just over yet, especially when they added new content and I now have a urge to conquer the master mode and something else from beyond.  Now for the actual review.   Goods  +Gameplay Gameplay of the game is very simple at first, but it steadily get harder when you find new tools, weapons and trinkets that give you new way to play the game and there are basically ""classes"" on the game, for example: warrior, summoner, archer/gunner and mage, there are more ""classes"" but you can make your own ""class"" by mixing up the armor, trinkets and others giving you chance to experiment every items what you find and what mostly suit your style.  +Art style The art style of the game is really pretty and all these years the art style has been improved quite a lot and especially the background since every area change the scenery and certain event affect the scenery as well, there are also lots of small details to see and some few changes on clouds as well.  +Music The music of this game is pure classic and all of them did have the tunes improved little bit and few news has been added after the journey's end update, there is also now otherworld version of ost that you can change it in the game after finding the certain secret.  +Price It's literally 10€ for several hours of fun and especially with friends.   Decents  =playtime You can easily sink great amount of time on either playing the game to end, crafting your perfect world or anything else, although if you just made completely new character and new world, the playtime might take quite a time until you get on the speed.  =Loot drop chance It might be little bit annoying to try getting the certain items from certain enemy, but there are few ways to make it easier.   Bads  -bugs/crashing I can't think of anything else being bad than bugged game or game crashing out of nowhere, but these are so rare you could just say: ""what bugs?""   Conclusion This game is pure classic since it was almost 10 years of it release on steam and this ""final"" update really show how much RE-Logic care about this game and it's fans, not only you get this great game pretty cheap, you also get lots of fun to explore the world, fighting powerful enemies, finding awesome treasures, build your own world and last but most importantly making your own story on this game on yourself or with your friends.  Welp, that's all for now.  Doktor Greenman, logging out."
172184787,english,1,105600,"Not often do I review games I enjoy, but the mindless wave of negative reviews has made me want to write SOMETHING.  Terraria is a game of passion, obvious from the decade the developers have spent updating and improving on the already-solid framework. It features some of the best 2-D combat I've ever experienced, a gorgeous art style, and a very satisfying progression.  All this is not to mention the countless high quality fan-made mods - Calamity, Thorium, and many others add dozens (if not hundreds) of extra hours of gameplay. The players are just as passionate about this game as the developers.  Most negative reviews (at the time of writing) don't criticize the game itself, rather the fact the devs don't share their political ideologies. It's disappointingly childish. While the game does have its flaws, don't look to these reviews for them right now.  If, by some off-chance, you are reading this and have never played the game, try it out! It may introduce you to a new favorite! Don't let the drama scare you off."
69858045,english,1,105600,"Objectively one of the most well-designed games on the market, right up there with Minecraft.  TL;DR for people who hate reading: game good, buy it.  Now, Terraria is often compared to Minecraft. However, these two games couldn't be more different. While both games share some similar mechanics, Minecraft has a heavy focus on creativity and survival, while Terraria has way more focus on combat depth and exploration. Lots of people call this game a ""sandbox game"", and I disagree with that. It's definitely more of a 2-D action RPG with sandbox elements. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to be comparing and contrasting this game with Minecraft, since everyone and their mother is familiar with it and most people are gonna come to Terraria thinking it's just 2D Minecraft.  So let's get into it, shall we? Minecraft has a straightforward gear progression system: Wood, Stone, Gold, Iron, Diamond, Netherite. Whereas Terraria has a very complex gear progression system that often gives you choices between gear sets. Gear and weapons are divided into different ""classes"": Ranged, Magic, Melee, and Summon. They're all equally viable, the only difference is that they all have different playstyles. Certain classes are better at certain fights than others, but in the end it all equals out. You won't even have access to all the gear sets or weapons in your first playthrough. This is because some of the ores and even biomes are randomly swapped out for something else entirely! For example, your world can either generate with Cobalt or Palladium, never both. So this gives the game tons of replay value if you want to experience everything, as different gear sets, weapons, and accessories often have different effects.  Minecraft has two bosses, whereas Terraria has somewhere around twenty, all with different mechanics and a huge variety of strategies with which you can use against them. Unlike Minecraft, building and crafting actually facilitates the combat. By that, I mean that you can build a dedicated arena complete with platforms, regen stations, mana regen stations, defense buffs, etc. to aid you in combat, and you can customize it to your needs. Do you want to automate the boss-killing process? You can do that. Defeating certain bosses also gives you access to new gear, places, and items. All of this gives the player a sense of progression, like they're always working towards something. There's also plenty of optional bosses, as well as random invasions that you can tackle. In Minecraft, the attitude is very ""do what you want"", which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Terraria's philosophy is just different. You can do what you want, but if you want to access a wider variety of blocks to build with or just want something a bit more challenging, that's what the progression system is for.  Next up are NPCs. Remember those Testificates in Minecraft that forced you to use a shoddy currency to buy low tier items for exorbitant prices? Well, Terraria does NPCs right. Terraria has a dedicated currency system unlike Minecraft (No, emeralds are not a dedicated currency system). This is your standard Bronze>Silver>Gold>Platinum MMO system. This currency is not mined, but is dropped from enemies. The NPCs in this game--and there are a lot of them--require you to build a house for them. Certain NPCs like/dislike certain biomes, and like/dislike certain neighbors. Each NPC has a unique function. For example, the Nurse will heal you to full health for a price, and the Clothier sells vanity items. Having two or more NPCs housed near each other will give you access to the pylon system, depending on how happy your NPCs are. Pylons are a teleport system designed to get you to house NPCs in several small villages throughout the world instead of all in one big base at your spawn point. Doing this will allow you to teleport to each of the villages you set up. This is a huge boon, because while the world isn't basically infinite like Minecraft's world, Terraria's worlds are still rather huge, and getting from point A to point B can be a really tedious task without these pylons.  Terraria also has a looming, omnipresent threat that creates a sense of urgency once you defeat a certain boss. These are the infectious biomes, the Corruption, the Crimson, and the Hallow. These biomes will begin to spread throughout the world, and if you let them run amok for too long, they may well consume your entire world. The Corruption and Crimson biomes are evil, and will always be dangerous and hostile environments. These evil biomes spread like a cancer, and NPCs won't live anywhere near them, forcing you to constantly build and move NPCs to new houses if something isn't done about it.  The Hallow in particular isn't necessarily an evil biome like the Corruption or the Crimson, but allowing it to spread rampant can lock access to various items and blocks that you would otherwise need to gain an edge over the next boss. You will need to employ various strategies to either keep these infectious biomes at bay, or eradicate them completely. In contrast, Minecraft is extremely laid back, with no sense of urgency. Again, Terraria and Minecraft are two very different games.  I could go on and on about the game's mechanics, but I've listed the main ones above. So, looking at the game objectively, here's my verdict. The character creation screen is sufficiently robust for the type of game that it is. You have multiple difficulty options, including Journey mode, which is a psuedo-creative mode with its very own progression system. The boss progression never gets too tedious and is always exciting whenever one spawns, as each one has a very different but heavy presence. The final boss is exceedingly challenging regardless of what difficulty you play on, which is honestly how it should be. After you complete progression on a world, you can start a sort of ""new game+"" in a new world, carrying over all your items and gear to the next if you so choose. I don't recommend this, as it basically breaks the game because difficulty does not scale with number of playthroughs on a single character, unless that's your thing. On a casual playthrough on a single world, it'll probably take you anywhere from 4 to 40 hours to beat, depending on what pace you like to go at. After that, you'll definitely want to play again and again. The pixel art is incredibly well done, especially with the recent overhaul. The music is some of my favorite in the video game industry, because it has such a unique personality. The community for this game is outstanding, and very alive. If you finished the game and want more out of it, Terraria does have mod support, so mod to your heart's content!  I really couldn't think of anything about this game that I disliked. I mean, one could argue that sometimes the bosses expect a bit too much from the player. Or maybe you'll just get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of items you're going to pick up if you're a packrat. But I honestly can't think of anything that is objectively bad about this game. So yeah, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone. My family and I play it together and everyone loves it.   Terraria recently released their latest and final patch ""Journey's End"" which added an obscene amount of content to the game! Re-Logic really treats their playerbase well, and I definitely look forward to what they have to offer in the future."

82815094,english,1,105600,"I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.  Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further.   Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime.   After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on.   With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.  I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me.   Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors.   Sincerely, Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen"

I have pirated the game and then I have bought game several times for myself, and several times as a gift for others. I have played the game solo, with friends, with my girlfriend and planning to introduce it to my daughters (who were born since the game launched). I have spent hundreds of hours on 1.0... hundreds of hours on 1.1... on 1.2... on  1.3... and planning to spend hundreds more on 1.4. I have built, fought, explored, created wild-life reservation worlds as well as apocalyptic wastelands...   So I guess, it's not that bad game after all."
32026626,english,1,105600,"Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10"
47798793,english,1,105600,"So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria:   - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements - It has an incredible amount of content to it - Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class) - Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy - A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight - Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now) - Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped!  - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore! - I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTING  Cons? Hmm.  - Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized! - Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though. - Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me. - Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game.   Other thought:  - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.  Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):  I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.  Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.  There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is.   I spent $10 on this."

Enough about the developers and marketing, lets talk about the game.  Amazing replayability, gameplay variety, length, and sense of consistent progression. The game has one of the best communities of any game I have ever played. Not to mention modding is now supported on steam (see Tmodloader) and the modding community is actually CRACKED.

80853945,english,1,105600,"This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a game, and I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offline, as well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years ago, I asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap, 10 US dollars at the time, which is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this game, as well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to download, I was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retro, and the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to time, ripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldn’t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the game, the music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own character, so many different styles and colours, so many choices and personalization’s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first character, and after that, I was set out into a mysterious world, filled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shuriken’s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hill, I had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every direction, and with demon eyes flying overhead, death was inevitable.  As soon as I respawned, my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventually, we held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay in, and that’s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building.   There are so sososososososo many blocks to build, hammer and axe together in intuitive, creative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for building, as the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing builds, and it only got better with each update. There was sloping blocks, paint, different walls, how each block melded together, how each block interacted with other blocks, the light sources, the different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform.   After I was done building my house, I set out to find more loot to plunder. That’s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for me, so the combat was less punishing then I’d like it to be, but the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfying, even hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculately, precariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which way, you have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think you’ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of fire, the game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.  The gameplay loop is a satisfying composition of combat, farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPC’s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boom, rare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the future, skipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the game, it has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the last, and it keeps pushing you forward, to the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straight, and I only got 1. I did other stuff in between, sure, but the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewarding, it is peaceful at times.  With the Journeys end update, the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftop, listening to the songs and watching my NPC’s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this game, its not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its community, from steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic game, and I could not recommend it more.  I absolutely adore this game, and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years. My words could never do it justice, even though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to me.   Thanks for reading 😊"

76984308,english,1,105600,"[h1] 💻/📱 Description: [/h1] Terraria is among the BEST if not [b] the best [/b] game of this [b] decade, [/b] which surprises me considering its very low price. The content is beyond overwhelming with many bosses, challenges and options that you won’t ever get bored of. The game revolves around [b] you [/b] the player, as the difficulty and gameplay change depending upon your progression. The art style and music are very exceptional, bringing us the fanbase pleasant memories even to this day.  [h1] 📖 Setting: [/h1] [h3] Summary [/h3] Terraria is a land full of mystery and wonder. You the adventure are given the task to cleanse this magical world from the spreading [b] cancer [/b] called Hollow/Corruption. Many powerful beings will stand in your way, so grab some loot, find allies and restore the balance. Since many players forget the fact that Terraria includes a story in the first place. I suggest you read the lore from the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Lore] Wiki [/url] to get accustomed to the plot.  [h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1] Terraria refers to casual and hardcore players alike. You can slay forces or start creating buildings, without though being obliged to do so. The game offers a variety of blocks and items that encourage creativity. You can even build your mini-golf park! The goal here is to have fun and not just constantly grind for loot.  [h3] Difficulty [/h3] The actual Difficulty mode is a character set selected during character creation. There are 5 types of difficulty: Softcore, Mediumcore, Hardcore and the newly added [b] Journey [/b] mode that can only be played on journey worlds. All the above-mentioned modes change the penalty upon death.  [table] [tr] [th] Description[/th] [th] Difficulty [/th] [/tr] [tr] [td] Characters start with extra equipment [/td] [td] Journey [/td]  [/tr]  [tr]  [td] Characters drop [b] coins [/b] upon death [/td]  [td] Classic [/td]  [/tr]  [tr]  [td] Characters drop [b] items [/b] on death [/td]  [td] Mediumcore [/td]  [/tr] [tr]  [td] Characters cannot [b] respawn!! [/b]  [/td]  [td] Hardcore [/td]  [/tr]  [/table]  Another form of difficulty is [b] world modes. [/b] Those are separate settings that apply to the [b] world, [/b] rather than the [b] character. [/b] Players may choose between Journey, Classic, Expert, and Master mode when creating a new seed. Each mode provides more loot, as well as special accessories depending on the difficulty you have chosen. I advise [b] new [/b] players to start with the Classic mode, as Expert and Master are very demanding for a novice adventurer. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894347971 [h3] Starting your adventure [/h3] Terraria starts its gameplay slow and steady, as it should be. You begin your journey with only 3 tools (sword, axe, pickaxe) at your disposal and a companion useful for his crafting guides. It’s up to [b] you [/b] the player whether you want to challenge the game since your imagination, skill and creativity shape the word and thus the adventure. As a tip, I suggest you start building a small house in the beginning. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894343444 [h3] Interactive playstyle [/h3] Terraria forces [b] you [/b] the player to manipulate the environment to survive. You can chop trees used for crafting; mine rocks used for building or combine all the materials to cross large gaps etc. Physics plays a major role in the game’s playstyle, so do expect lots of deaths caused by [b] fall damage. [/b] There is also a small detail concerning nightfall, but that’s a surprise for you to explore. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894342641 [h3] Scaling [/h3] [b] Grinding [/b] Terraria is very famous for its grinding potential. There are many repeatable bosses, each offering different and unique [b] treasure bags [/b] that are considered valuable for your future encounters. Countless items offered by a specific boss or gained by certain activities, such as fishing, have a very low [b] drop percentage [/b]. This concept favours repeatability, so do be patient, as sometimes even the best things in life take a while.  [b] Classes [/b] There are 4 classes in Terraria: Magic, Ranged, Melee and Summoning. Each class requires different armour sets and weapons that provide unique stats and abilities, depending upon the material they were made from. It is most favourable to stick with 1 class during a playthrough, as this way you can aim your focus on specific items and equipment. Read the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Class_setups]Wiki [/url] and choose carefully which role to main first.  [b] Loot [/b] There are lots of accessories, mounts as well as vanity items with interesting [b] specialities [/b] that bring joy to competitive and creative players alike. A perfect example is the [b] Cloud in a Bottle [/b] which grants the user the ability to extra-jump midair. You can combine the accessories to create even stronger ones in the Tinkerer's Workshop. There are countless combinations, so take your time while reading the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Tinkerer%27s_Workshop]Wiki. [/url]   [h3] Wiki, Wiki and more Wiki [/h3] Overall, the experience is amazing, however, the learning curve is extremely demanding. This is a feature that does not go well with many players. As you have noticed above, you [b] will [/b] have to consult the [b] wiki [/b] regularly to truly master the game. Otherwise, you going to encounter many problems and difficulties that eventually will lead to confusion. Terraria is [b] very [/b] grind demanding game, so bring some friends in your journeys as co-op is more than encouraging!  [h1] 👁‍🗨 Visuals: [/h1] Terraria runs pretty well even on a [b] potato [/b] Pc. It is a small game with a gorgeous yet simple artstyle that continues to captivate me to this day. The game runs smoothly in low settings with minor loading times. In the rare case you encounter problems with performance, I suggest you turn off the effects.  [h1] 🎧 Audio: [/h1] Terraria’s music is [b] exceptional [/b] in its way. Every biome, boss as well as event has its unique song that fits the theme. I encourage you to buy [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/409210/Terraria_Official_Soundtrack/] Terraria: Official Soundtrack [/url] as it proves to be a piece of excellent background music to listen to. You also provide a small token of appreciation to the developers.  [h1] 🗃️ Side Notes: [/h1] Terraria is a challenging game for those who want to reach its completion. Before starting your adventure, I recommend you to get accustomed to terms like Pre-Hardmode - Hardmode mode etc. The game takes time to master, so do not get disappointed if you are struggling in the beginning. Be patient and most importantly have fun.  If you crave more challenges the [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/] tMoadLoader [/url] (available on Steam) will become your best friend, so why don’t you give it a try!!  [h1] 📣 References:  [/h1] The below links are some content creators that gonna make you fall in love with the journey. They provide tips as well as tricks that prove very useful having them at your disposal :  •	[b] Chippy Gaming [/b] https://www.youtube.com/user/ChippyGaming  •	[b] Yrimir [/b] https://www.youtube.com/user/Yrimir  •	[b] Hero [/b] https://www.youtube.com/user/HERO  [h1] 📋 Verdict: [/h1] Having in mind its low price compared to the amount of content that it offers, I consider Terraria a gaming paradise for both creative and challenge thirsty players. It refers to all ages, as its unique gameplay encourages fun and creativity. You can build constructions, kill enemies, fight bosses, everything depends upon your playstyle. We are stealing a church!  I need to express my enormous gratitude to Re-Logic, as their sheer will and passion made this masterpiece relevant, with many updates and tweaks beloved by the community."
146636516,english,1,105600,"Terraria is old, very old... it had so many ""this is the final update"" updates that I lost count, the developers seem to just love it too much to let go (all of said upgrades of course completely free!)  The level of value delivered for this game is unbelievable, fun platforming, fun combat, fun exploration, it's a complete package of all things awesome that a 2d game can offer.  Not to mention how much you can extend your experience with mods and special seeds (added by the developers) that fundamentally change the game.  On top of that, re-logic (the makers of terraria) just decided to support Godot and FNA to help out other game developers hopefully achieve a similar level of success that they did... a true class act.  I bought terraria in all platforms I own, highly highly highly recommended, 10 bucks for THOUSANDS of hours for high quality fun is a steal"
16212660,english,1,105600,"This Indie sandbox game really has a little something for everyone. Whether you are into building, creating pixel art, PvP, PvE, this game has something for you!  Once you've made your character, you start off in the world of Terraria. Your first goal is survival. During the first day, you deal with pesky slimes while you gather the materials needed to build a shelter before nightfall. Once night comes, the undead swarm you. Are you resting safely in your new house, or are you forced to fight until daybreak?  If you thought slimes and undead were all you had to worry about in this world, you were wrong. Outlandish minions and deadly bosses await every turn, as you explore the many different environments in the world. Defeating them will reward you with new materials, weapons, armor, and even trophies to display.  Beware of the corruption, an environment native to Terraria, that slowly spreads, trying to shroud your world in darkness. Or, will your world contain the crimson? A festering landscape, oozing with blood and flesh that constantly tries to devour you. You will not be left defenceless against these horrors, however! You can work to purify the land to its original state.  In your travels, you will find resources that you can mine and gather. Combine them into powerful weapons and armor, or shape them into building blocks for new structures. As you grow and progress, NPCs will begin to flock to your buildings, offering you aid. You will even find some out in the world, waiting to be rescued.  Tunnel through the earth, or take wing and fly to the clouds. Purify or corrupt. Build or destroy. The world of Terraria is yours to explore, and mold into your image."

You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble.   It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there. It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination."

[/h1]  To be completely honest, for years I did not like Terraria. The biggest problem with the game is you literally don't know what to do or how to progress in the game without looking up a guide on the Terraria Wiki, or by asking more experienced players. To me, I just find that as bad game design.  There could have been some sort of quest log that gave you some indication of what to do next, otherwise the beginning of the game becomes rather dull.  Moving on, once you do know what you are doing, the game becomes surprisingly more enjoyable as Terraria focuses on combat and boss encounters. Each boss is different from one another, and are actually challenging. The game limits you from getting better gear until a specific boss is defeated which keeps the challenge high throughout.  Apart from that, as you kill bosses new enemies and events will appear in the game unlocking a vast new variety of weapons, items, and equipment.   One thing I had not realized is the incredible amount of content Terraria offers. As soon as you think you are done with the game, it just keeps going with even more bosses, more grind for even better gear, and just so much new stuff as you go along. (be sure to keep checking the wiki to see what bosses are next and how to unlock them)   [b]It is very important that you play this game with a friend. Playing it solo is simply not as fun, especially considering the time investment.[/b]   General overview: + Loads of content + Fun combat system with a large variety of weapons, spells, and gear. + Lots of fantastic bosses + Very challenging + An ever-changing world with loads to explore + Great fun with friends + Very easy to host a server and game is very minimal on resources (meaning anyone with a PC can enjoy this, even on a laptop)  - Somewhat impossible to progress without a guide - The first half of the game is rather boring compared to the later half - A bit straining on the eyes with pixel graphics, especially with a high resolution monitor - A bit too challenging at times (especially playing solo) - Resources are limited, meaning you won't be able to get items without generating a new world (your character can move between worlds and servers)  [b]Highly recommend generating a medium to large world[/b]   To sum things up, Terraria is a fantastic game to play with at least one friend (preferably just 2-4 ). It offers an extremely high amount of content, lots of bosses, fun gameplay, lots to explore and craft, and its cheap!   +++ Highly recommend."

77993818,english,1,105600,"My first ever Steam game. Boy was it a great 8 years, or however long it was. Sadly, the journey has come to an end. We all knew this was coming, after 1.3 came with the true endgame it was only a few years' time for the finale.  Back when I first joined, I was a little guy. Started playing back in the 1.1 days. I learned the ropes, and I had a lot of fun. Most of my time was occupied by another childhood favorite, Minecraft, however I played this quite often too. I found a server, and started playing some minigames, meeting people, and fighting bosses with them. Those times were great.  Then came 1.2, a glorious time. I started my first true playthrough, as a ranger, and was determined to beat the Golem, which I did after some time. I ended up painting my entire spawn in negative colors because I was bored. Those were also fun times.  After that came 1.3, the endgame. I wasn't playing it much during this time, due to not being able to use a computer, but I played it and it was enjoyable nonetheless. I met more people, played more games, did more playthroughs, and I ended up getting into mods.  But eventually, things go as they come.  1.4 is a bittersweet update, to say the least. It made the game look so much better, and performed smoother overall too. The changes added were astronomical, but nothing truly game-changing, well except for Empress of Light. The new Master mode is okay, but it lost so much potential it could have had. x10 spawnrate is also fun, but I only put some 40 hours into that. Got pretty far, but it just got too strenuous, with school starting up and all too.  A game I once knew to be simply three mechanical bosses and some hallowed gear changed into the vibrant landscape it is today, but never to change anymore. It's one of many relics lost to time of my childhood, and one that will go in my mind as a great memory collection, yet not to be added to much more. I might play this game here and there, but it just isn't what it used to be.  May I wish you all good luck in your virtues, and hope you all have a great time, as I once did.

150159381,english,1,105600,"I wanted to write this review after I spent enough time in the game and have gotten most of the achievements. So now that I’m about 109/115 achievements & 100 hours playtime, I feel I can finally give an adequate review.   I felt this game was hard to get into at the beginning but if you have someone help you through the first steps in learning the game play and crafting mechanics, it gets easier and more fun. It’s hard because at the start, you basically are some weak homeless dude and have to fight off slimes, collect and craft, materials build your own house before it gets dark (and pretty much do this for the entirety of the game but as you progress, you get to upgrade your gear and it gets easier). It sounds like a grind but it’s well-worth it. It’s somewhat satisfying to build yourself up from the beginning, from wood walls to the solar or vortex brick or something.   The coolest part of the game is the crafting and building aspects of it. There’s so many different types of materials, which you can make into various styles of brick or wall paper, even furniture (like balloon furniture). There’s so much customizability in how you can build your houses. There’s different environments or “biomes” so you build houses that are befitting of that specific biome and then you get NPC’s to move in. You can also collect weird paintings which you can decorate your houses with.    There’s different game modes too so if you want a challenge, you can play hardcore or if you just want to build, you can do journey mode which allows you to duplicate items so you don’t have to destroy your world mining it all. It’s one of those games where there’s no right way to play. Play how you want and play how you think is most fun.  The music and the scenery in the game is also very pleasant, so it’s a very nice chill relax game. It’s nice solo and coop. 10/10 would recommend.  [b]In brief, here's some aspects I loved about it:[/b]  [list]     [*] environment & character customization     [*] crafting, collecting, and building     [*] open world exploration of different scenic environments     [*] soundtrack (that corresponds with the biome)      [*] different game modes and difficulties     [*] adorable creatures throughout the biomes  [/list]   Notice, I didn't mention combat in my review. Eh, it's not my type of game combat wise but that's the beauty of this game. There's different game modes where you can choose what type of experience you want from the game. Some go for those hardcore challenge runs and I go for Journey mode because I love the buidling and crafting elements."
71027789,english,1,105600,What could I possibly say? You don't spend 900 hours in a 10 dollar game if it sucks.
51279217,english,1,105600,"Terraria is one of the top rated games on steam. And honestly, it deserves it. I think this is a damn good game. I won’t say it’s a perfect game and there are certainly some things you should know before you buy it, but I will happily give it a recommend.  [u]Let Me Begin with What the Game is About and What Makes it Cool.[/u] You start out with a basic sword, axe, and pickaxe, in the middle of nowhere. You’re first step is to get wood and build a shelter to protect you from the zombies at night. Next you need to dig down and get ore to make better gear. So it’s 2d minecraft? Well it’s more than that, let me continue. You’ll need decent armor and weapons to fight the tougher monsters that live underground and to fight bosses.   Yep bosses. Bosses are one of the defining elements of this game. Bosses are big and imposing and they play this awesome adrenaline music when you summon them (a lot of the Terraria music is awesome btw). And there’s a huge variety of bosses too: There’s a floating eye that aggressively charges at you, there’s a big worm creature that breaks into smaller worms as you damage it, there’s an angry plant that can only be fought in the claustrophobic jungle, there’s a cult leader that summons mirages of itself and makes the game into a bullet hell with how many projectiles it spits out. Now bosses can be very punishing, but this is a building/crafting game, so you can build your own arena with platforms to jump on and walls to protect you from (some) attacks, or craft potions that boost your speed, health regen, armor, and damage. The fact that you can tackle bosses on your own terms in your own arena is one of the most interesting parts of the game and it really makes boss fights feel epic.   Killing bosses is the main way you progress through the game. Killing them gives you some kickass loot or lets you access a parts of the world where you can discover some more kickass loot. There’s a lot of loot in this game. And it’s some pretty cool loot too. You get staffs that call meteors down from the sky, fireball staffs, swords that shoot fireballs, machine guns, rocket launchers, different kinds of ammo to go in your guns, yo-yo’s (yo-yos are a really cool weapon), boomerangs, tools that summon monsters or turrets to fight for you, tools that let you jump real high (useful for dodging boss attacks), vehicles that let you move real fast, grappling hooks for going spelunking. The more bosses you kill and the further you progress, the more powerful and interesting the loot you get. Seriously, getting new loot just feels absolutely wonderful in this game.  So yeah, I would say mining, boss fighting, and collecting loot are the meat of the game, but there’s plenty of gravy too. Maybe you want to take a break from boss fighting and do some fishing so you can get a chainsaw fish and also some potion ingredients. Well then you probably want to create a few ponds throughout your world. And you’ll probably want to set up some minecart tracks or teleporters to get to your ponds quickly. Or maybe you want to set up a mushroom farm because mushroom are good for potions as well as crafting some late game armor. Well you’ll want to create several rows of dirt so the mushrooms have plenty of surface area to spawn on. And if you don’t want to harvest mushrooms manually you can set up a bunch of conveyor belts and wire so the mushrooms just fall down and come to you. Or maybe a part of your world is corrupt. Corruption spreads slowly so you may want to dig a trench around it to keep it quarantined, or you can buy a special gun that cleanses corruption outright. Or maybe you need a bunch of unicorn horns. You could go to the part of the world where unicorns spawn and kill them with your flaming yo-yo. Or you could dig a big pit and every time a unicorn come by it falls into the pit and dies because the pit is full of lava and spiky traps. This is a crafting game where enemies are just another crafting resource, so setting up a death pit to farm unicorns is a logical thing to do. There’s plenty of stuff to do in Terraria and plenty of ways to do it.   [u]And Now for the Parts of the Game You Might Not Find so Cool.[/u] First of all, the difficulty. Specifically, the bosses. Bosses will kill you. Bosses are tough. You can give yourself boosts with potions and armor, but dodging attacks is your best bet. And that can be very difficult when the boss charges rapidly at you or shoots a dozen balls of lightning at you. You will need to learn the attack patterns of bosses and you will need to train your reflexes. I mentioned bullet hell earlier, and I really do think this game has bullet hell elements. If you just can’t stand bullet hell games you probably want to avoid Terraria. (Since difficulty is a pretty subjective thing, you may want to look up a video review of Terraria and see some boss fights and combat for yourself.)  Another thing I want to mention is the sheer amount of stuff to learn. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Terraria wiki. It’s a crafting game, so you’ll need to look up crafting recipes as well as how to get ingredients. It’s also a game about fighting giant bosses, so you’ll need to know how to summon bosses and you’ll probably want to read some tips on making an arena. If you want to build a garden or fishing pond you’ll want to know when certain herbs bloom and how much water to put in your pond. For building more complex structures, you may want to look up tutorials on youtube (the game has gone through several updates though, so some youtube tutorials are out of date). Personally, I kinda enjoyed learning the game. I’d get some weird item in my inventory and immediately going to the wiki to see what I could do with it. But I realize not everyone wants to study a wiki while they play video games.   One of the interesting parts of the game is how it’s a building/fighting hybrid kind of game. And while that’s cool some of the time, it can be really annoying at other times. Say you’re underground building an arena to fight a boss, then a bat flies out at you, now you have to stop building and take out your weapon. So you kill the bat and try to get back to building, but another bat spawns and you have to kill that one too. The game literally has a formula where if it detects there aren’t any enemies near you it will spawn new enemies, so you will constantly have to fight off annoying enemies while you’re trying to build or mine. (I should mention that there are tools that help deal with enemy harassment, but you need to know how to get them, which reinforces my point that you need to read the wiki)   I don’t really like Terraria’s endgame. Most of the early and midgame consists of exploring, building, and crafting, with the occasional action-packed boss fight thrown in, which I like because it offers some nice variety. However the endgame is back-to-back combat. Fight a boss, then fight a bunch of minibosses, then fight another boss, then fight four living towers which spawn very fast very dangerous enemies, then fight another boss. For my first playthrough of this game I stopped playing when I got to the endgame because I just didn’t want to slog through all the fighting. Now, I actually like the combat and I liked fighting bosses throughout the game, but it’s a simple combat system and fighting loses some of its charm when you do it for too long.   So this review turned out longer than I expected. I guess I wanted to be thorough. When I first played this game I got pretty frustrated at times and I was prepared to toss out the game altogether. But then I got into it a bit more and learned the mechanics better and I actually really liked it. Despite its flaws, this is probably one of my favorite games ever."

67608782,english,1,105600,"Absolute classic. Whenever I play it feels like I'm progressing whether it be getting a new weapon, killing a boss or just building a really nice house for an NPC it always feels like I'm moving forward. Surprisingly, the game hasn't really seemed to show any signs of its age despite being almost 9 years old at this point. The music is fantastic especially during boss fights. Boss fights have a perfect challenge level when you do them with the intended gear and there are a whole lot of bosses to fight throughout the game. The game has a ""halfway point"" just when you start to feel established which really puts you back on your toes and creates an excellent dynamic without taking anything away from the player. Expert mode feels like a perfect challenge for people who have a lot of experience by adding new mechanics or just small buffs to each boss. Overall one of my favourite games of all time."
77589421,english,1,105600,"Not much to say, everyone knows this game, everyone loves this game. 9 years of free updates is unprecedented and the developers are top tier for sticking with community this long. It's hard to even compare the game we got at the release and what it has became now. Simply amazing."
83377962,english,1,105600,"[spoiler]Since I don't know English very well, I apologize for my mistakes.[/spoiler]  Most likely, my review will remain in the shadows, and hardly anyone will reach the end of my review, I still want to share with you my feelings and the seasoned spirit of adventure. It all started many years ago, when I got acquainted with one of the most wonderful, warm, and memorable games in my life - Terraria. When pronouncing this word, I immediately feel warm in my soul, I remember the wonderful soundtrack and completely immerse myself in my thoughts. Before reviewing, I immediately want to note that this game gave me a new perception of computer games, and gave me a great childhood.  I myself am not an ordinary player in Terraria, and there are few such oldies, because I got acquainted with Terraria even before its release, or more precisely, before the official release of the game on Steam (May 16, 2011). And although I have played 200 hours of this game in my Steam, I actually played it for about 1000 hours. When I was little, I, like all children, played Minecraft, and I really liked this game, I thought that I could not find a better game. But one fine day, my dad came home from work and told me about Terraria, which just appeared. Another employee told Dad about the game, and another employee told this employee, and then I don't know the story of the spread of rumors about a brand new freshly baked Terraria. When I first started the game, I created my character, spending several hours on it, pressed the button to create a world, and found myself on the ground. Someone walked next to me, his name was Guide, who first fell into the abyss ... I don't know why he did it, but it didn't really bother me. The first thing I learned was how to walk, jump and dig, and it was incredibly fun! After that I dug a hole for myself, buried myself on top and went to play Minecraft ... Don't judge strictly, but for a child then Minecraft was much more colorful, and had a 3D view, and not a cropped 3D space along the Z axis. But a couple of days later I went back in into the game, and again continued to explore the world, the game did not cause as much enthusiasm for me as many people who have started playing quite recently. And I don't know if it's good that I started playing such a raw game. But as time went on, I studied the world of Terraria more and more. I got to know cute teardrop-mongers and creatures that were constantly killing me. I realized that I needed a home to live, and that's when I discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of all the games I've played - building. So I gave up traveling and started BUILDING and DIGGING! And then this game completely sucked me in. I quit Minecraft and started DIGGING, KILLING, AND EXPLORING. I met new residents who can SELL! And a nurse who can CHOOSE! I also realized that the Guide is not a useless piece of garbage, and that you can have a heart-to-heart talk with him. In the end, I killed the ominous Eye of Cthulhu, which sowed fear, and the game ended there ... But soon new updates came out, I downloaded new versions and went all over again. And it was interesting. I went through each update, and did not get a mental pleasure. Since I like everything more difficult, I started playing the game on the Expert Advisor, and later on the Master. But all this was not enough for me! And I started to go through mods, for those who know Calamity mod, I went through this game with Revenge and Death modes, and also after a few hundred attempts I went through Boss Rush. Then I lost my nerves.  With each update, the game brought new emotions and a colorful world to the players and me. Every progress you make is much more satisfying than the last one and continues to push you forward, to the point where you don't stop. There is no point in talking about old versions, so I'll tell you a couple (hundreds) of words about the new Terraria.  For me this game became a home in which I felt comfortable. The game is currently in the game about 500 varieties of mobs. There are also 19 bosses and 13 mini-bosses, as well as 3 additional bosses in the mobile version. And from listing recipes you can break your tongue. Sloped blocks, paints, different walls were added to the game, each block merged together, each block interacted with other blocks. Light sources, different platforms that you may have used. All of this and more meant that anything imaginable could be built. Many people create amazing mechanisms and worlds, better than on paper!) Although they made a convenient interface for creating my character in the game, I also devote a lot of time to creating a character). And the music and style of play makes me crazy. I bought this game for my every account, and made all my friends, no matter if it was voluntary, to purchase this masterpiece. And if you are thinking whether to buy this game, I can hardly answer you ... YES !!! This game is amazing both solo and when playing with friends! You can catch hares and then fill the whole world of your friend with them! It's worth buying for this!  I can confidently say that Terraria has become my corner of safety, this is my home, there is no place easier and quieter than it.  Thanks Andrew Spinks, Whitney Spinks ❤ Thanks Re-Logic ❤ Thanks Terraria ❤ Thanks for reading ❤"

105945973,english,1,105600,"The amount of labor, love, and time that the developers have spent fine-tuning and improving this game is truly astounding. With over 5000 items, 28 bosses and minibosses, easy multiplayer access, and mod support all wrapped up into a $10 bundle with no extra microtransactions or DLC, Terraria is a masterpiece that large-scale game companies could only dream of making. A single playthrough can easily last you over 30+ hours, for most, that is barely the tip of the iceberg.  This is a game that you can play and replay multiple times and still discover new items and mechanics with each playthrough. Every new world is a new adventure, a new place for creativity, an escape from reality to let your inner imagination run loose. Nothing pushes or pressures you to rush through the game, it is a self-paced journey that, despite the many labels put onto it, has no real end. Some people play the game to find new items and accessories, others play to build the ideas that live in their minds, but no matter how you decide to play the game, there is something for everyone to enjoy. Relogic called the 1.4 update “Journey’s End,” but I think that, even now, it is just the beginning.  In addition to all of this, the multiplayer in this game is absolutely phenomenal. Playing, chatting, and enjoying the game with friends is an incredible experience*. The pacing of the game barely changes compared to single-player and the atmosphere and ideas that can run through your world can be incredible. Access to the steam workshop, a place where you can share your creations or see the creations of others, is also a great addition to the game**.   Unfortunately, no game can be perfect in every way, I do have a few minor issues with the game.  RNG: Most items in Terraria are commonly available throughout the game. However, a very select few are very Rng dependent and can often feel like a chore to grind for. Fortunately, most of these items are entirely optional such as the information accessories and some late-game boss drops. Summoner Class: There are 4 main fighting classes in the game, Melee, Ranger, Mage, and Summoner. The latter is a unique class that uses minions to fight for you. This is a fantastic concept, but it is very poorly executed due to the lack of variety of summoner weapons and armor. Master Mode is a new difficulty in Terraria that was added in the 1.4 update, which increases the difficulty of the game by tripling the monster’s health and damage… that’s it. Other than a few extra cosmetic items, Master Mode is simply Expert Mode but with more enemy health. It doesn’t add anything new or interesting so it is usually best to just avoid it unless you are into that type of gameplay.  These are very minor flaws with the game and absolutely do not impact the overall gameplay or enjoyability at all. Terraria is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have had, the time I spent playing by myself and friends during the lockdown was definitely time well spent. If you are someone who enjoys building games, combat of all types, exploration, or just want a game that is a mixture of all of these, then I definitely recommend buying this game. If Relogic had made the updates cost money, then I absolutely would have paid, and the fact that they continue to add free updates to this game 10 years after its release just goes to show how much they care about their player and fanbase, and that is absolutely something I am willing to support.   * If you plan to start a multiplayer world with more than two people, I highly recommend playing on an expert mode world because of the modified boss drops. If you play on a normal world, then you will get boss drops equivalent to the boss drops of single-player, whereas an expert world’s boss drops are equivalent to the number of players on the world.   ** Terraria also has fantastic mod support, with the developers at Relogic just recently updating TModLoader to 1.4, and though I have never played modded Terraria, I have heard fantastic things about all kinds of community creations.   TL;DR  Good game, you should buy"

There are A LOT of things I could say about Terraria, but put quite simply: it's worth every penny.  The bosses are a blast, each class is fun in their own unique way, Expert difficulty is perfection (Normal is too easy and you get less loot; don't ever play on Normal), even the NPCs all have their uses!  Technically speaking, an NPC is only ever useless depending on your class or personal preference (e.g. some people may not care for the Angler achievements, or a mage might not care for the Arms Dealer, etc.).  You will always have something to do, at pretty much any given point in the game.  And even when you've 'beaten' the game and gotten bored of your world, you could just make a new character, new world, and have a totally new experience!  Then, even if you get bored of that, you can download tModloader for FREE, and mod the game to your hearts' content!

It is simplistic enough to jump right into and yet at the same time, complex enough to keep one playing for years and years. The three pillars of the game are Building, Fighting, and Exploring. You have your own little (or not so little) world that is chock full of loot enemies and unique environments for you to kill and build yourself while doing the same to your planet. Good enemies: as varied as the freckle patterns on a persons face fun loot: There are six buttloads of stuff to shoot, slash, equip, or throw. (or explode) Blocks: for the crafty, theres a bunch of different blocks... (like if you though minecraft had a lot of blocks...) Bosses: you keep thinking how am I ever gonna be strong enough to beat that. (then you get strong enough and theres another)  all in all I highly recommend this game. its awesome. 10/10 would (will) definitely play again"

71383430,english,1,105600,"I would like to start off this review by saying one thing. This is one of the best games ever made. Now, most people would probably look at this game and think it's just 2D Minecraft, but it is so much more than that. The main similarities are in the blocks and survival aspects of it. But beyond that Terraria is just so much more.  Summary:  Gameplay - [9] When you start a world for the first time it is a very slow game, but the game quickly picks up the pace. There is no hand-holding in this game whatsoever, you have to do everything yourself or check the Terraria wiki page. You change a lot during your adventure and in the end the game is very fast-paced.  Soundtrack - [10] The soundtrack is some of the best I've ever heard in a sandbox game. It's so simplistic yet so good. It is very catchy and I will never forget the iconic song Overworld Day which is instantly recognized.  Graphics - [10] Since it isn't aiming for realistic graphics you really cannot give it a bad score. It's a very specific kind of art style that fits the game very well.  Price - [10] The price is incredibly cheap compared to what you get. You get a really long game with a bunch of replay value. It costs 9,99€ on Steam but often goes down to 4.99€ during sales. It's a great price.  In conclusion: Terraria is a fantastic game that has everything you would ever want in a game like this. You should really buy this if you want a really good sandbox game. The developers have been supporting this game for years now and still have 1 last update left called Journey's End. Thanks for reading this review."

There is so many things to learn and so many different paths to take on this adventure, it can almost be overwhelming. There is SO much to do.  If your looking for a 2D game to get invested in, this is it. This gave has everything from  - bosses   - player made houses  - currency system  - EXTREMELY well thought out game progression (EXTREMELY)  - multiplayer  - mass amount of weapons and items  - very appealing graphics  - easy controls  - achievements and so much more.

18435281,english,1,105600,"Alright so I've been playing this game ever since 1.0.4, building stuff, killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming, so it's about time I should actually make a review on this game. I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.  Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.  But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts)."

64747184,english,1,105600,"For everyone saying this is a 2D Minecraft, you're wrong. This game has a lot of stuff to offer. Different kind of bosses, unique items, an adventure u WILL NEVER forget, Terraria."
38067494,english,1,105600,"This is one of the best games ever made and the only reason it is not regarded as such is that it is not very accessible. I can imagine many critics have started Terraria, played for some hours trying to figure it out, and put it away. Very often, critics have drawn misguided conclusions that Terraria resembles Minecraft (or is a Minecraft clone), but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Terraria is a procedurally generated sandbox survival metroidvania. Learning curve is steep, the game is hard and often requires you to consult to wikis and guides (even more so than the Souls series) but once you gain control of the game mechanics, you will find a very deep, hard core gem. Don’t let its eye-candy graphics fool you…  You are dropped into a world surrounded by many dangers. Initially, you are expected to make your first shelter, first weapon and just survive. This is the very core of the whole game. In order to beat stronger creatures, you need better weapons for which you need better crafting material. To get better crafting material, you need to mine deep into the earth, which leads you to find secret chests, face gazillion creatures including “bosses”. Boss fights not only require skill, but also need you to have the weapons, armors, potions, items necessary to beat them. Last, but not the least, there are plenty of events such as Halloween, Christmas, Pirate Invasion etc. with their own unique bosses and loots.  While you are working on mining for better tools, armors, weapons to be able to beat stronger enemies, you also need to keep expanding your “shelter”. A chair, ceiling and door is not sufficient any longer. You need to keep building new rooms to have room for new crafting centers and chests (for inventory). Every new room invites a new NPC to your shelter who can be crucial in your quest to beat the world of terraria, whether they sell unique items or provide healing.  Being a true sandbox game, you can also ignore progression and spend hundreds of hours just building. Your limit to what you can build and how you can customize it is your imagination. People at Terraria subreddit still manage to amaze me with their creativity and sometimes totally mind-blowing architecture.   Whether you choose to play it as a metroidvania or as a sandbox 2d Minecraft, you will love Terraria. In my opinion, it is one of the best games ever made.  [b]PS:[/b] Buy it full price. Developers are still updating content and supporting the game after all these years (without any paid DLCs whatsoever), they really deserve some support.  [b]10/10[/b]"
88490547,english,1,105600,"I've been playing this game since 2014 (on and off obviously) and after journey's end I have to review it just to say the sheer quantity and quality of content in this game is incredible. If you somehow haven't played terraria yet you really should. There is more or less something for everyone, and while it's very fun in single player, especially if you're more into building and collecting items, it's so much more fun with other people.

7877530,english,1,105600,"Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the ""crafting"" genre seriously. These were my first impressions.  However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!).   The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!  There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!  Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).  If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years)."
2092948,english,1,105600,"Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft. And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends."
57972609,english,1,105600,"""omG iTs jUsT 2dEE mInEcRafT!"" is the only thing I hear as a Terraria player, and I have to say that that is completely and utterly wrong. The game is great once you get into it but I think the reason it is so underrated is because the beginning of the game is a bit lacking. People just start up a world, chop down a tree or die to a slime or something and get bored. With Terraria you have to be patient. The game is difficult and a bit unforgiving at times but with the sheer amount of places to explore and items to find I personally think it's an amazing game. The best part about the game in my opinion is the music. I unironically listen to Terraria music sometimes it's that good. Anyway, I'm gunna go play some Terraria now. Bye!"
32842453,english,1,105600,"Lets get into it shall we   Terraria, the game that makes you question your life choices more than a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book on existentialism. I've spent more time in this pixelated wonderland than I have in the real world, and let me tell you, I regret nothing. My therapist might disagree, but what does she know about the joys of defeating pixelated bosses and building houses for NPCs who can't even say ""thank you""?  With over 1200 hours logged, I can confidently say that Terraria is not just a game; it's a way of life. Forget sunshine and fresh air; I've got mushrooms and glowing ore to keep me company. Who needs friends when you have a loyal army of NPCs, each with their unique quirks and questionable fashion sense?  The variety in this game is mind-boggling. I mean, where else can you go from fighting a gigantic eye to crafting a rainbow gun that shoots unicorns? It's like a fever dream mixed with a dash of pure, unadulterated awesomeness. Terraria is the only place where you can go from feeling like a badass ninja to a master chef whipping up delicacies for your digital neighbors.  Speaking of neighbors, those NPCs are a special bunch. They move in, mooch off your hospitality, and somehow manage to get themselves killed by zombies every other night. It's like living in a retirement home for video game characters, and I love it. Who wouldn't want a nurse, a wizard, and a gun-slinging arms dealer as roommates?  The building aspect of Terraria is like playing with virtual Legos, only better. Sure, you could build a modest little house, but why stop there when you can create a floating island with a disco floor and lava waterfalls? My creativity knows no bounds, and neither does the game's ability to let me indulge in my architectural fantasies.  Terraria is the only game that has me questioning whether I've been spending too much time in the real world. Why go outside when I can explore the vast reaches of the underworld, battle mythical beasts, and collect rare artifacts? The real world doesn't have pixelated penguins, and that's a deal-breaker for me.  In conclusion, Terraria is not just a game; it's a lifestyle. I highly recommend it to anyone who values creativity, exploration, and the ability to ignore real-world responsibilities. With 1200+ hours under my belt, I can confidently say that Terraria is the reason my plants are dead, my dog is hungry, and my social life is practically nonexistent. And you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. Five stars, two thumbs up, and a digital high five to the developers for creating this masterpiece. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dungeon to raid and a virtual pet to feed."

I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun.   I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime.   Do I recommend this game? Yes! Absolutely!

In fact, for a single player experience, i'd say Terraria beats Minecraft hands down. But this isn't about Minecraft, so i'll list a few things as to why Terraria is great. Terraria is for those who love the idea of growing and becoming stronger the more you play. In the beginning, you're pretty much helpless, killing the weakest enemies in multiple hits. You move slugglishly, and minor heights and caverns are truly intimidating. In the end, you are a force to be reckoned with, capable of taking down hoards of enemy after enemy mithout even pressing a button - diving to the deepest parts of the world and traversing every terrain with ease.  The change is gradual, and each challenge is tougher than the last. But if you're up for the grind - and its a fun one at that - then Terraria is for you."

Later on, you gear up; and fight your first boss.   It gets harder over time and you have more and more responsibilities to keep your world on its feet, and don't let the bad thing happen..."
88734962,english,1,105600,"Terraria: Sand Is Overpowered  - Graphics :   2-D vibrant graphics with block-like textures and a ""washed"" look. No HD, ultra-high settings. Just plain old sprites with 2-D.    - Sound :   Electric-type soundtrack. It's a bit unique since it sounds completely original and could almost be classified as something new. Soundtrack aside, all of the items and enemies and humans sound believable. Laser guns have a laser sound, a slime enemy makes a jello sound when it's killed, the player will emit a pain sound when attacked. Again, nothing weird or out of the ordinary since it's a pretty simple concept.    - Gameplay :   2-D sidescrolling, using the WASD keys to move up, down, left and right. Since it's a sandbox game, there's lots of things to create. You will primarily be mining the blocks that compose the entire Terraria world you create in order to make items like armor and weapons or buildings. PVP is also included, but is restricted to online server use. There are bosses to defeat, NPCs to find, thousands of items to create or collect, miles upon miles of caverns to explore beneath the ground, and of course sky islands to explore. There is water, lava and honey. Terraria is all about exploring and combat, with creation being a minor, but still vital, part of the game."
41478867,english,1,105600,"A game developed and published by Re-Logic.  Terraria, an interesting title, where your imagination determines how far you can progress, and how much time you will pour into this game. A hollow world till you arrive, teeming with precious ores, and dark secrets. Fetid swamps and dry deserts.  This game is definitely an endeavour, and it will soak up alot of your time as you try and reach the pinnacle of your characters limitations and how much you can construct. Often remarked as a ""2D Minecraft"" I always find this comparison woefully incorrect. Minecraft has a wide selection of enemies, which is similar, A wide array of ore and precious gems to mine, which is also similar. But from then one, Terraria leaves it dead in the water. An RPG experience, with substantial boss progression, Active try and retry game mechanics and spanning character classes, All inclusive of a massive crafting system, and wide assortment of things to collect and try.  Anyways, I've praised it enough, lets get down to the review!  Graphics: Probably one of the weaker points of the game, Its still very vibrant and holds upto despite its 2011, Birthdate. This is mainly due to the pixelated graphics and 2D perspective of the game. Not alot to render, and not alot to process at any one time, Making it run very smoothly at any point in time, But also extremely limited due to there not being any sort of graphical options or benchmarks.  Gameplay: Where do i begin. This game plays, as well as you can play it. All the mechanics are there for you to make it work in your favor. But finding your niche and finding your work space is all crucial in you enjoying your time in Terraria. The game drops you into a world, where you basically don't understand anything, A very limited spread of understanding, very few tools at your disposal, and a single NPC to help guide you along your journey. 4 classes to basically choose from as you progress through the game, Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. All depending on how you want to play and how you prefer to play. Despite there being no relevant story or backstory to this game, there is a substantial amount of progression and ALOT of gear to rummage around for.  Story: I think i pretty much covered this aspect of the game already. There really isn't a story here. Which is usually a game killer for me. I heavily invest in story driven worlds, And this world has none to speak of. I guess the story can be made up for each player, as to why you are doing what you're doing, but as for a story driven narrative. There isn't one.  I don't often do a ""CONS"" section. But this game is so monstrous in terms of scope and size, I feel it's necessary to provide as much information as possible. I love this game to bits, this is perhaps the 3rd time i've played it through, Once on playstation, once on Xbox and now on PC. So i'm well aware of his rather frustrating flaws. So here we are.... Cons: This game despite how much effort has been poured into it, Has rather sizable and numerous flaws. Mostly relating around achievement glitches, game crashing and multiplayer bugs. Achievement glitches are fairly frustrating, although are entirely not a concern unless you're as OCD as i am. The game progresses the same way regardless of steams registering of your progress. Game crashes for alot of players at certain intervals in the game, Which HAS caused loss of character saves. It's highly recommended that you cloud save your favorite character builds and worlds, so that your save data will always be present. And Multiplayer as a whole is a fairly awful experience, the above mention bugs as well as an assortment of new things, Players not seeing what each other are seeing, Enemies and bosses despawning because of numerous players involved, which may or may not potentially ruin hours upon hours of preparation and planning. Frustrating to say the least. But alot of it is avoidable if you take necessary precautions. Alot of which can be found through quick internet searches.  Overall: This game is a gigantic time suck lol There is no other way to put it, You will pour time into boss by boss progression, farming and grinding enemies for specific gear to better improve your chances at the next boss. You will dig deep into dirt, mud and ash for hours upon hours just to find 3 pieces of ore which isn't even close to the amount you need. You will kill thousands of enemies for a single piece of gear, that isn't even optimal till you find another piece it can be fused with. You will die on the inside for days and potentially weeks as you farm your way to the very end of the game. And then when it's all over and you finally can get a breath of respite as your real life world is crumbling to pieces around you, You will feel empty, knowing that it's done. This game isn't just worth its price, It's worth every minute you pour into it. Welcome to Terraria. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do."
26677395,english,1,105600,"This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.  I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.  Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.  Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do.   There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!  Now this Game might not have the best ""graphics"" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way.   I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low! So just give it a shot!"
136258986,english,1,105600,"I intitially lost my progress twice, I just looked at the store page and seen ""steam cloud"" support and didn't think I need to do anything to keep my progress safe. On the character/world selection page there are options ""play, favourite, move to cloud, rename"" just so you don't repeat my mistake pick move to cloud for world and characters you care about.  Besides that It's a fun game, once you get a basic hang of it. Learn how to build a house, move around the map fast, craft, find/summon bosses and you're good to go.   You can do as much or as little in this game as you want, you can challenge yourself with different world/character level of difficulties, there's also a journey mode that offers god mode/time manipulation/ítem duplication, It's basically a creative mode.   This game is a sandbox title with no story so play however you see fit.   This game has a lot to offer and despite putting in almost 100 hrs I feel like I still have a long way to go.  Reccomended to people looking for an addictive time sink game."
36450210,english,1,105600,If your focus is on gameplay rather than on graphics then this game is for you. If you want a cool game and not a mind fucking shit then this game is for you. If you are a creative person and dont like spoon feeding then this game is for you. If you like adventures and explorations rather than instant actions then this game is for you. If you like a value for money game and dont want to spend a big amount then this game is for you. If you like killing zombies and monsters with your own made weapons then this game is for you. If you want to play on your old laptop and cant afford heavy rig then this game is for you. If you want to make a world of your own then this game is for you. If you want to play alone or with your friends as well then this game is for you. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.

[*] The soundtrack is good. [*] The bosses are challenging. [*] The almost endless things to do in this game. [*] It takes a long time to complete the game. [/list] [b] 👎Cons: [/b] [list] [*] It’s very hard to learn at first. [*] Playing this game can easily leave you lost on how to move forward. [/list] [hr][/hr][h2] 🎮Gameplay: [/h2][hr][/hr] Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with a focus on exploration, building, crafting, combat, survival, and mining, which is playable both in singleplayer and multiplayer modes.   The player begins in a randomly generated world with only basic tools to progress. In order to craft better tools, the player will need to mine the starter ores, such as iron and tin. As you gather these resources, you can build a house to protect yourself and make better tools and armor to fight the monsters that spawn at night.  Also, you should be searching for life crystals if you want to increase your max health, and you should be searching for fallen stars if you want to increase your max mana. Mana is the ""ammo"" you need for your magic wands and items that need mana.  Once you have built a house, you need to build houses for the NPCs to live in. The NPCs can sell you useful items for the money you receive from defeating enemies. There is also a guide NPC who can give you hints on what to do. You can also find NPCs around the world who need help, and when you help them, they can move into your house.   It is time to explore the world and go deep into the mines to find better ores, but be aware because there are traps and strong enemies in the mines. If you don't have the appropriate pickaxe, you won't be able to mine all the ores at first. As well as the mines, you will have to go through the different biomes you will find in the game. Both are generated randomly.  Various world events may occur that make the enemies stronger, such as the blood moon, slime rain, etc. These events usually happen at night.   By destroying a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart, a meteor will fall in your world, which you can mine to craft some useful items.  You can do a lot in Terraria whether you're bored or not. You can start a building project or do side missions that NPCs give you, etc. The game does not require much grinding, but it takes a while to mine enough ores.  I think that much of the game should be discovered by the players themselves, so I'll leave you with just this and hope that you'll want to get into this awesome 2D game called Terraria.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌲Biomes: [/h2][hr][/hr] There are several different biomes in the game, including the snow biome, jungle, desert, and more. There are also biomes underground that have secrets to be discovered. I won't tell you much about the biomes since exploring is part of the game, but I will say that the biomes are well designed and interesting to explore. In the mines, you will find chests with loot that could be very useful.   [hr][/hr][h2] 📄🎩Bosses and some facts: [/h2][hr][/hr] I won't tell you about the boss's abilities and such, because I think you should discover that for yourself as you progress.   The bosses spawn when you have the right item and do a certain action with it, such as throwing it into lava or clicking on it. You can also summon bosses by speaking with some NPCs. Different areas have their own bosses to face. The bosses are well thought out, and the difficult ones are the ones near the end of the game so you don't just defeat them all with the bad loot and complete the game with that. Prepare yourself with potions and good equipment if you are going to take on one of these bosses.  To progress in the game, you must defeat the bosses, because that will result in you getting more items and unlocking things in your world that you couldn't do before. This is a 16-bit style game, and I think it suits the game well.   [hr][/hr][h2] 🌎👕Options of your world and character customization: [/h2][hr][/hr] It is possible to change some stuff in your Terraria world such as the seed, the size, difficulty. You can also decide if there will be corruption or crimson in your world.  Various customization options are also available, including clothing and clothing colors, hairstyles, eye colors, and more.   [hr][/hr][h2] 💭Final Thoughts: [/h2][hr][/hr] If you're looking for something to play for a while and you want to always have something to do, then Terraria is the game for you. It has an excellent soundtrack and great features. The bosses are challenging, and the game takes a long time to complete. Overall, the game is excellent.   Rating: 8/10"
137451762,english,1,105600,"Terraria is a game that has stood the test of time and continues to captivate players with its unique blend of exploration, combat, and creativity.

The game offers a vast and dynamic world to explore, filled with a variety of biomes, enemies, and treasures to discover. From the underground depths of the earth to the heights of the sky, there's always something new and exciting to uncover.  But Terraria isn't just about exploring - it also offers a robust combat system that will challenge even the most seasoned players. With an array of weapons, armor, and accessories to choose from, players can tailor their playstyle to suit their preferences and take on the game's bosses with confidence.  And let's not forget about the game's creative potential. With a plethora of building materials and tools at your disposal, you can let your imagination run wild and create everything from towering castles to intricate pixel art. The possibilities are endless, and the satisfaction of seeing your creations come to life is truly rewarding.

From building massive structures together to taking on the game's challenges as a team, Terraria is a game that brings people together.  In conclusion, Terraria is a game that has something for everyone. Its vast world, engaging combat, and creative potential make it a must-play for any fan of sandbox games.

34867907,english,1,105600,"I've put lots of time into this game, even before I bought it on Steam. When I did finally get it on Steam, I purchased two copies: one for myself, and one for my wife. We played together, helping each other collect health and mana upgrades, equipment upgrades, and collecting the NPCs. She fought off slimes and zombies while I established gardens for mushrooms, trees, and plants for potion ingredients. We mined, we explored dungeons and caves, we fought bosses and discovered how to navigate Hell.  It's been an amazing time, and this game has been well worth the amount of money I've spent on it. I've gotten more hours of enjoyment out of it, both alone and with my wife, than I have with nearly every $60 AAA game. The music, the graphics, the controls, and the amount of stuff available to do just make it an easy recommendation for me."

80101227,english,1,105600,"(it contain small spoilers what is ahead, skip this story if you just want to witness yourself and go directly to quick review section. Also I kinda had to update this review a little bit, minor fixing on my writing and maybe adding some more stuff for my story part.)  Terraria...  It's been over 9 years since it has been released on steam and perhaps still over 9 years since I got my hands on this pure gem.  When I first time saw this as pretty foolish person and thinking this being just ""2D Minecraft"" but thankfully I was completely wrong about it and getting really into this game.  Sure your first time playing this game might be so slow and boring, but once you get your hands on very interesting gears and meet very important people that sells even much more interesting stuff, then this game slowly starting to get some speed, also don't forget to build houses for them.  The first time when I was capable enough to take on the Wall of Flesh, I was very certain this was the final boss of the game, until for the surprise it unlocked the hardmode and I reacted by saying: ""I'm sorry what?""  Upon that moment I realized the adventure was just getting started, but eventually I was getting bored with the game even couple years later when I played with group of friends, it didn't take long until we decided to stop playing. Although I did enjoy the fun time in the game and I will never forget that time when I tricked someone to step on the pressure plate that was rigged with explosives.  Few years later I decided to check back in the game and wow how much it has been changed from and started to play again to see what new and exciting things to discover and this time I did play little bit longer.  On this time I felt it gave more content than enough for me to at least write down the review, but oddly enough it felt like it was missing something from all this so I decided not to make the review.  Upon this year near spring time, they announced upcoming perhaps truly final update for the game: ""Journey's End""  That update was a huge one when it arrived and I personally felt like it is finally time to finally finish this game on hardest possible difficulty, so I finally created my final character, my final world, readying my copper blade and getting almost instantly killed by green slime!   Yes...   it is that hard, but I decided to keep going even if it was going to drive me completely insane because of it, until on that moment when I soldiered on this pure madness, I finally was face to face with the official final boss of Terraria... The Moon Lord and boy how much tries it took until I was near only 3 HP left on my character before finally defeating it and it never felt so good when I saw it dying and seeing the credit rolling for the first time.  But...  Now I feel this adventure isn't just over yet, especially when they added new content and I now have a urge to conquer the master mode and something else from beyond.  Now for the actual review.   Goods  +Gameplay Gameplay of the game is very simple at first, but it steadily get harder when you find new tools, weapons and trinkets that give you new way to play the game and there are basically ""classes"" on the game, for example: warrior, summoner, archer/gunner and mage, there are more ""classes"" but you can make your own ""class"" by mixing up the armor, trinkets and others giving you chance to experiment every items what you find and what mostly suit your style.  +Art style The art style of the game is really pretty and all these years the art style has been improved quite a lot and especially the background since every area change the scenery and certain event affect the scenery as well, there are also lots of small details to see and some few changes on clouds as well.  +Music The music of this game is pure classic and all of them did have the tunes improved little bit and few news has been added after the journey's end update, there is also now otherworld version of ost that you can change it in the game after finding the certain secret.  +Price It's literally 10€ for several hours of fun and especially with friends.   Decents  =playtime You can easily sink great amount of time on either playing the game to end, crafting your perfect world or anything else, although if you just made completely new character and new world, the playtime might take quite a time until you get on the speed.  =Loot drop chance It might be little bit annoying to try getting the certain items from certain enemy, but there are few ways to make it easier.   Bads  -bugs/crashing I can't think of anything else being bad than bugged game or game crashing out of nowhere, but these are so rare you could just say: ""what bugs?""   Conclusion This game is pure classic since it was almost 10 years of it release on steam and this ""final"" update really show how much RE-Logic care about this game and it's fans, not only you get this great game pretty cheap, you also get lots of fun to explore the world, fighting powerful enemies, finding awesome treasures, build your own world and last but most importantly making your own story on this game on yourself or with your friends.  Welp, that's all for now.  Doktor Greenman, logging out."
172184787,english,1,105600,"Not often do I review games I enjoy, but the mindless wave of negative reviews has made me want to write SOMETHING.  Terraria is a game of passion, obvious from the decade the developers have spent updating and improving on the already-solid framework. It features some of the best 2-D combat I've ever experienced, a gorgeous art style, and a very satisfying progression.  All this is not to mention the countless high quality fan-made mods - Calamity, Thorium, and many others add dozens (if not hundreds) of extra hours of gameplay. The players are just as passionate about this game as the developers.  Most negative reviews (at the time of writing) don't criticize the game itself, rather the fact the devs don't share their political ideologies. It's disappointingly childish. While the game does have its flaws, don't look to these reviews for them right now.  If, by some off-chance, you are reading this and have never played the game, try it out! It may introduce you to a new favorite! Don't let the drama scare you off."
69858045,english,1,105600,"Objectively one of the most well-designed games on the market, right up there with Minecraft.  TL;DR for people who hate reading: game good, buy it.  Now, Terraria is often compared to Minecraft. However, these two games couldn't be more different. While both games share some similar mechanics, Minecraft has a heavy focus on creativity and survival, while Terraria has way more focus on combat depth and exploration. Lots of people call this game a ""sandbox game"", and I disagree with that. It's definitely more of a 2-D action RPG with sandbox elements. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to be comparing and contrasting this game with Minecraft, since everyone and their mother is familiar with it and most people are gonna come to Terraria thinking it's just 2D Minecraft.  So let's get into it, shall we? Minecraft has a straightforward gear progression system: Wood, Stone, Gold, Iron, Diamond, Netherite. Whereas Terraria has a very complex gear progression system that often gives you choices between gear sets. Gear and weapons are divided into different ""classes"": Ranged, Magic, Melee, and Summon. They're all equally viable, the only difference is that they all have different playstyles. Certain classes are better at certain fights than others, but in the end it all equals out. You won't even have access to all the gear sets or weapons in your first playthrough. This is because some of the ores and even biomes are randomly swapped out for something else entirely! For example, your world can either generate with Cobalt or Palladium, never both. So this gives the game tons of replay value if you want to experience everything, as different gear sets, weapons, and accessories often have different effects.  Minecraft has two bosses, whereas Terraria has somewhere around twenty, all with different mechanics and a huge variety of strategies with which you can use against them. Unlike Minecraft, building and crafting actually facilitates the combat. By that, I mean that you can build a dedicated arena complete with platforms, regen stations, mana regen stations, defense buffs, etc. to aid you in combat, and you can customize it to your needs. Do you want to automate the boss-killing process? You can do that. Defeating certain bosses also gives you access to new gear, places, and items. All of this gives the player a sense of progression, like they're always working towards something. There's also plenty of optional bosses, as well as random invasions that you can tackle. In Minecraft, the attitude is very ""do what you want"", which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Terraria's philosophy is just different. You can do what you want, but if you want to access a wider variety of blocks to build with or just want something a bit more challenging, that's what the progression system is for.  Next up are NPCs. Remember those Testificates in Minecraft that forced you to use a shoddy currency to buy low tier items for exorbitant prices? Well, Terraria does NPCs right. Terraria has a dedicated currency system unlike Minecraft (No, emeralds are not a dedicated currency system). This is your standard Bronze>Silver>Gold>Platinum MMO system. This currency is not mined, but is dropped from enemies. The NPCs in this game--and there are a lot of them--require you to build a house for them. Certain NPCs like/dislike certain biomes, and like/dislike certain neighbors. Each NPC has a unique function. For example, the Nurse will heal you to full health for a price, and the Clothier sells vanity items. Having two or more NPCs housed near each other will give you access to the pylon system, depending on how happy your NPCs are. Pylons are a teleport system designed to get you to house NPCs in several small villages throughout the world instead of all in one big base at your spawn point. Doing this will allow you to teleport to each of the villages you set up. This is a huge boon, because while the world isn't basically infinite like Minecraft's world, Terraria's worlds are still rather huge, and getting from point A to point B can be a really tedious task without these pylons.  Terraria also has a looming, omnipresent threat that creates a sense of urgency once you defeat a certain boss. These are the infectious biomes, the Corruption, the Crimson, and the Hallow. These biomes will begin to spread throughout the world, and if you let them run amok for too long, they may well consume your entire world. The Corruption and Crimson biomes are evil, and will always be dangerous and hostile environments. These evil biomes spread like a cancer, and NPCs won't live anywhere near them, forcing you to constantly build and move NPCs to new houses if something isn't done about it.  The Hallow in particular isn't necessarily an evil biome like the Corruption or the Crimson, but allowing it to spread rampant can lock access to various items and blocks that you would otherwise need to gain an edge over the next boss. You will need to employ various strategies to either keep these infectious biomes at bay, or eradicate them completely. In contrast, Minecraft is extremely laid back, with no sense of urgency. Again, Terraria and Minecraft are two very different games.  I could go on and on about the game's mechanics, but I've listed the main ones above. So, looking at the game objectively, here's my verdict. The character creation screen is sufficiently robust for the type of game that it is. You have multiple difficulty options, including Journey mode, which is a psuedo-creative mode with its very own progression system. The boss progression never gets too tedious and is always exciting whenever one spawns, as each one has a very different but heavy presence. The final boss is exceedingly challenging regardless of what difficulty you play on, which is honestly how it should be. After you complete progression on a world, you can start a sort of ""new game+"" in a new world, carrying over all your items and gear to the next if you so choose. I don't recommend this, as it basically breaks the game because difficulty does not scale with number of playthroughs on a single character, unless that's your thing. On a casual playthrough on a single world, it'll probably take you anywhere from 4 to 40 hours to beat, depending on what pace you like to go at. After that, you'll definitely want to play again and again. The pixel art is incredibly well done, especially with the recent overhaul. The music is some of my favorite in the video game industry, because it has such a unique personality. The community for this game is outstanding, and very alive. If you finished the game and want more out of it, Terraria does have mod support, so mod to your heart's content!  I really couldn't think of anything about this game that I disliked. I mean, one could argue that sometimes the bosses expect a bit too much from the player. Or maybe you'll just get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of items you're going to pick up if you're a packrat. But I honestly can't think of anything that is objectively bad about this game. So yeah, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone. My family and I play it together and everyone loves it.   Terraria recently released their latest and final patch ""Journey's End"" which added an obscene amount of content to the game!

177402372,english,1,620,Hilarious dialogue. Deep lore. Difficult puzzle experience. These things make this game and it's prequel my favorite video games I've played. Only complaint is there's not a third game.
171628798,english,1,620,"God, it's amazing how well this game holds up even after more than a decade. Both the singleplayer and co-op experiences are top tier in their own way. The voice acting is simply spectacular, the story is intriguing and the puzzles get progressively harder throughout the game (thus providing you with a nice learning curve). This sequel overall is a great step up from the first game and a must-have for virtually any gamer I'd say."
187593044,english,1,620,"Rating: 10/10  Developed by Valve and released in 2011, Portal 2 is a masterpiece of puzzle-platforming, featuring brilliant level design, sharp humor, and one of the most memorable narratives in gaming. Expanding on the mechanics of the original Portal (2007), this sequel introduces new puzzle elements, a longer and richer story, and an incredibly fun co-op mode. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys brain-teasing challenges and witty writing.  Why Portal 2 is a Masterpiece 🧩 Brilliant Puzzle Mechanics The core of Portal 2’s gameplay remains the portal gun, allowing players to create two connected portals to navigate through puzzles. However, this sequel introduces new elements like:  Excursion Funnels (tractor beams that carry objects and players) Repulsion Gel (bouncy surfaces for high jumps) Propulsion Gel (speed-enhancing surfaces) Light Bridges and Aerial Faith Plates Each of these elements adds depth and variety, keeping puzzles fresh throughout the campaign.  🎭 Incredible Writing and Humor Portal 2’s dialogue is legendary. The writing team, led by Erik Wolpaw, delivers some of the funniest and smartest lines in gaming history. GLaDOS, the sarcastic AI antagonist, returns with passive-aggressive insults and dark humor, while Wheatley, voiced by Stephen Merchant, provides an energetic and often hilarious presence. The game’s humor is perfectly balanced, making it both funny and deeply engaging.  🏢 Expanded World-Building Unlike the first game, which mostly took place in sterile test chambers, Portal 2 explores the history of Aperture Science. Players venture into old, decayed sections of the facility, uncovering audio logs of Cave Johnson, the eccentric founder of Aperture. This deeper lore makes the world feel more alive and mysterious.  🤝 Co-op Mode – A Perfect Two-Player Experience Portal 2 features a fully-fledged cooperative mode, where two players control Atlas and P-Body, two testing robots. Co-op puzzles require teamwork, timing, and communication, making it one of the best cooperative experiences in gaming. It’s brilliantly designed, ensuring both players feel equally involved in solving the challenges.  🎶 Memorable Soundtrack Portal 2’s soundtrack, composed by Mike Morasky, features dynamic music that adapts to player actions. The game also ends with another hilarious song from GLaDOS, ""Want You Gone"", following up on the iconic ""Still Alive"" from the first game.  Are There Any Flaws? ❌ Some Puzzles May Feel Too Easy for Veterans Compared to the original Portal, some experienced puzzle-solvers might find Portal 2’s difficulty a bit more forgiving. However, the co-op mode and community-created test chambers provide plenty of challenging content.  ❌ No Portal 3... Yet The biggest flaw? Valve never made a Portal 3. 😢  Conclusion Portal 2 is a masterpiece that balances clever puzzle design, fantastic humor, and deep world-building into an unforgettable experience. Whether you're playing solo or with a friend, the game delivers one of the most rewarding and entertaining adventures ever made. It remains one of Valve’s greatest achievements and is highly recommended for any gamer.  🔹 Rating: 10/10 – Brilliant puzzles, unforgettable characters, and one of the best co-op experiences in gaming."
186970926,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.  One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.  Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.  Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.  Overall, Portal"
176943111,english,1,620,"Massive improvement from the first game. Co-op is fun too, you can be confused with a friend and be dumb together."
174349935,english,1,620,"This game has the best campaign of any Valve game and is just full of character and charm.  It lacks a little bit in content, but what is there is all killer no filler.  A masterclass game that has stood the test of time and could be pointed to as one of the reasons Valve is arguably the greatest development studio of all time.  9/10."

166543545,english,1,620,"This game is absolutely perfect. The puzzles and the story that has this game are one of the best I've ever seen. It's just a masterpiece. Good job, Valve."
191145010,english,1,620,"It's the sequel of one of the greatest puzzle games of all time, how can you go wrong with this game? It's story is much better than the first game IMO, and the Co-op puzzles are great. Valve, if you see this, make Portal 3 pls."
170283595,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is developed by Valve and released in 2011. It's the logical continuation of Portal published in 2007.  The first Portal was an excellent ""First Person Puzzle"", but seemed like a tutorial disguised as a game because it was so short.  Its long-awaited sequel Portal 2 is much more elaborate and accomplished in all areas.  You play once again as Chell, who wakes up after a sleep in cryostasis that seems to have lasted an eternity. She discovers that Aperture Science's labs are partially destroyed because of her past actions. Wheatley, a ""Personality Core"" seeks to help you so that you can both leave these ruins.  But that's without counting GLaDOS, who seeks revenge for what she once suffered... Escape the Test Chambers, try to learn more about Aperture Science experiments, and the motivations of its charismatic yet intriguing founder Cave Johnson. A richer lore and a plot full of twists and turns await you!  The gameplay and level design are even better than in the previous opus,  which was already particularly brilliant. The puzzles are very well thought out and really original, some are still quite difficult,  and that's not a bad thing. You still have the Portal Gun, which works the same as before: you can open two portals and carry small objects, in order to solve different puzzles to escape from the Test Chambers…  The Puzzles with Buttons and Cubes are back, along with new mechanics, like: - lasers whose trajectory must be diverted towards receptacles using specific cubes with a glass surface, - platforms that catapult the cubes or even the player allowing them to make huge jumps, - bridges made of light which can connect one area to another, and even act as a protective wall, - tractor or thruster rays which can either attract or push the player or an object towards a given direction, - gels giving new properties to the surfaces they cover:  • The blue gel makes the Cubes and yourself bounce once in contact with it, • the orange gel makes surfaces slippery and makes you reach impressive speeds, • the [b]White[/b] gel allows the opening of portals on any flat surface covered with it.  The artistic direction is way more detailed than in the first game. The decors are now much more varied and less minimalist. Aperture Science is now the shadow of its former self. The Test Chambers are partially destroyed, several machines and mechanisms (superbly animated) malfunction before your eyes. Time has passed since the first adventure, God only knows how long. Nature has reclaimed its rights, water has infiltrated almost everywhere in the center, vegetation has invaded... Some areas are covered in graffiti with curious messages from the Ratman,  like in the first Portal.  Despite all that, the atmosphere is not as bad as you might imagine.  The particular dark humor that made the charm of Portal's narration is once again omnipresent.  GLaDOS likes to recall what Chell did to her in the first game.  She likes to make fun of Chell, demean her with false compliments… Later in the game, pre-recorded radio messages from Aperture Science boss Cave Johnson can be heard. He is as megalomaniacal as he's eccentric and devotes his life to science. For him, sacrificing the health of his employees in often bizarre experiments is nothing compared to what it can bring to science. He seems to have inexhaustible financial resources, and despises modest people.  The messages are often hilarious and disconnected from the apparent seriousness of the situation. Many short videos explaining certain experiments and the philosophy of Aperture Labs are displayed near the elevators at the beginning and end of the level.  Mike Morasky composed all the music for Portal 2, and the least we can say is that the soundtrack is simply masterful. It has futuristic electronic sounds, sometimes robotic if you can put it that way. Some are calm and relaxing, while others are more rhythmic in more scripted gameplay phases. The music is also dynamic, the melody and tempo changing depending on where you are and your speed. The soundscape features natural sounds contrasting with those of various machines.  Portal 2 takes all the best elements of its predecessor and improves the formula in every way. Longer, richer and even more fun than the first Portal, this sequel exceeds expectations. Enjoy this essential game which I cannot praise enough, a true work of art. [spoiler]And I affirm that as of this writing, Portal 2 remains Valve's latest masterpiece, before they start developing tasteless GAAS and VR games inaccessible to most people, especially since we were already waiting for Half-Life 3 at the time.[/spoiler]"
185904143,english,1,620,"Portal 1 was a Legendary Classic, Portal 2 is an improvement in every way. Not weaker or worse in any way, the sequel is just as perfect. Definitely a MUST play for all gamers!  Portal 2 is a competent dexterity and logic puzzle platformer, undisputed best one out there.  The story is better, the lore deeper, the mechanics more expanded and level design is intelligent. The multiplayer and custom content are the cherry on top, just as delicious!  One of the best games of all time, we will play it forever. If I didn't currently need disk space, I'd keep it always installed.   The cake is not a lie! It's just not the baked confection we wanted. You'll find it if you look at Chell from behind.."
176780949,english,1,620,"Literally one of the best games of all time. It's witty, interesting, and a real head-scratcher at times! The mechanics are perfectly thought out and balanced to the extreme. If you haven't played either Portal game yet, you are truly missing out."
178582016,english,1,620,"From the moment you start the game, you're greeted with a vibrant and colorful environment to explore. The game's setting is a mysterious research facility, and you play as Chell, a test subject who's been awakened from stasis to find that the facility has been overrun by decay and neglect.  The gameplay is a blend of physics-based puzzles and platforming, with a variety of challenges that will test your problem-solving skills and reflexes. You'll need to use the portal gun to create portals on surfaces, allowing you to teleport between them and manipulate the environment to your advantage. But that's just the beginning - the game introduces new mechanics such as gels that can change the properties of surfaces, and lasers that can be redirected and focused.  But Portal 2 isn't just about solving puzzles. The game's witty humor and deep narrative are also highlights, with a memorable cast of characters including Wheatley, a personality core with a mind of his own, and GLaDOS, the malevolent AI from the first game. The game's story is more fleshed out than the first, with a surprising twist that will leave you questioning the nature of reality.  And for those who enjoy a more challenging experience, the game's difficulty curve is steep, with tough puzzles that will test your skills as a gamer.  The game's physics engine is also a highlight, with realistic physics and environmental interactions that make every encounter feel unique. You can use the game's physics to your advantage, such as using portals to redirect lasers or manipulate momentum.  So if you're a fan of puzzle-platformers and want a mind-bending adventure that takes everything that made the first game great and expands upon it, then Portal 2 is the game for you. With its vibrant and colorful environment, challenging gameplay, and engaging story, this game is a must-play for any fan of the genre. Just be prepared for a thrilling and sometimes intense journey into a world where nothing is as it seems."
183308888,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a brilliant blend of creative puzzles, engaging gameplay, and a touch of dark humor. As a sequel to the original Portal, it expands the mechanics with new tools like gels and excursion funnels, making every level a satisfying test of logic and creativity. The single-player campaign offers a perfectly paced journey, filled with clever puzzles and a captivating narrative.  One of the standout features of Portal 2 is its co-op mode. Here, teamwork and communication are essential as you and a partner tackle increasingly complex challenges. The dual-portal mechanics add layers of depth, requiring both players to think several steps ahead and truly collaborate.  The game’s writing and characters shine as well, with GLaDOS delivering her trademark wit and Wheatley adding an entertaining mix of charm and chaos. While his decisions might frustrate you, they’re a great driver for the story.  Whether you're playing solo or with a friend, Portal 2 is a rewarding brain workout that challenges your problem-solving skills and keeps you engaged from start to finish. A must-play for puzzle enthusiasts and gamers looking for something truly unique."
166505417,english,1,620,"Do you really think Glados would spare us just because he thinks the player is too difficult to kill and let us go free. LMAO No way, we want portal 3"
179450309,english,1,620,"Portal 2 expanded upon that perfect formula of portal 1 into something even greater. The gameplay is silky-smooth and intuitive, and the feeling of freedom in solving problems is both satisfying and very rewarding.   The way the game introduces and teaches you to master the new mechanics, like the propulsion and repulsion gels, is brilliant, layering each concept naturally into the puzzles without ever feeling overwhelming.   In this game especially, the story, voice acting, and atmosphere take center stage, masterfully binding it all into a perfect experience of humor, wit, and innovation.   and it has alot of content both a great single player mode and the co-op mode i have yet to experience it again as i've played the co-op mode before on console. and how can we forget about the great community of portal 2 workshop.  Portal 2 is not just a game; this is a timeless work of art. i 100% recommend this game also worth the price."

182983237,english,1,620,"Simple, Creative, Timeless.  Perfects the formula from Portal 1 and adds more twists. Clever puzzles that makes you feel like a genius, quality writing that flips your expectations. Banter between characters was welcome addition. I'm not even into puzzle games but this was brilliant all the way through."
192286130,english,1,620,"Great game. I'd recommend it purely for the voice lines by Wheatly. The entire storyline is goated, but man that robot is hilarious."
181459906,english,1,620,"One of the best games I have ever played - the puzzles test your critical thinking skills, and leave you with an immense satisfaction when they are solved. The lore, story, and setting of the game is so well thought out - a perfect blend of humor and eeriness. The level design is very detailed and designed as so you can begin to not only solve the physical puzzles of each level, but also mentally piece together the puzzle that is the lore and story based off of the dialog you hear as you play. This is a game I could replay thousands of times and still not get bored. 11/10 game."
178269424,english,1,620,"If you thought Portal was good, wait til you try Portal 2, it's a masterpiece. From the lore to the voice acting, the choices Valve makes to make these games is incredible. Solid 10/10. One of the great classics."
188554486,english,1,620,"I want to say this, i dont think valve is making a portal 3. But for the last portal game, its great, good story, though, some achevments are a bit odd In my say."
187862924,english,1,620,Takes the semi tech demo vibe of the first game and instills it an incredible story led by a legendary character and a legendary vocal performance. I don't think a third game will live up to this game's legacy and I do not think it is worth trying.
169223173,english,1,620,Portal 2 is a very nice game to be played with your friends! Totally recommend!

183376261,english,1,620,"This is a game you can pick up with a friend and have an amazing time together, even 13 years later. While I can't say much about the solo campaign, I highly recommend the co-op mode. It’s perfect for an evening of laughs, teamwork, and creative problem-solving.  The best part? The game is super affordable, especially during sales! Grab it, grab a friend, and enjoy!"

193096428,english,1,620,"My God, VALVe never disappoints.  It's actually amazing how good this game is especially considering the fact that it's usually on sale for like a dollar. When i first played the original Portal, i did like the game but i wouldn't say i loved it. it was a neat little game that fit it's small scale very well but for me, it didn't have that ""uumph"" factor a lot of VALVe games have. No matter how much you liked the original Portal, you have to admit the final product did feel like a side project VAVLe didn't put too much effort into compared to their other games like Half Life 2 or Left 4 Dead.  Here? They completely threw that. There's sooo many new ideas here, paced evenly so that all the new mechanics get their time to shine without it feeling overwhelming. The environmental storytelling, while not as eerie as the first in my opinion, sells it's fantasy much better than the first with all the different moods they tried to evoke here like the dilapidated and broken down test chambers from the first game, or getting to see [spoiler]Cave Johnson go from a young aspiring scientist to a desperate and broken shell of a businessman by listening to J.K Simmons wonderful audio logs.[/spoiler] The characters are so brilliantly written, they feel and act like real people and that trademark wit and sass from the first game is still here without taking away from the serious moments in the game. My only minor complaint is that i wish the game had more variety in how you could tackle the puzzles you're given because i feel like that would have given it more replay value and it would've let you be able to solve the puzzles faster in your own way.  Nonetheless, while i personally don't think this is VALVe's best game (i still think that title does to Half Life 2) the feats this game accomplished should not at all be ignored. Seriously what are you waiting for? The game on it's usual price is cheaper than a family meal and on sale it's the price of a KIt-Kat bar. Go buy it. 10/10"
188914698,english,1,620,"Ah, Portal 2. The portal gun is iconic. When platforming games and puzzle games are done well it can make for a very satisfying game but when they are both done well with a unique concept/mechanics.... *chef's kiss*  If you somehow don't know anything about the portal series, or if you're just considering trying it out, go for it. It is truly unique and iconic. OR, if you're like me and you have it but never finished it, I highly recommend you do so.  Backlog Games Beaten 2025 6/50"
179801099,english,1,620,"I absolutely LOVE it! The story mode is incredible, and the co-op campaign is pure chaotic fun from start to finish."
176024431,english,1,620,"Initially I though it's just the co-op part, but after completing it I realized there's a whole story to this thing. Both single and multiplayer were a blast"
170724403,english,1,620,"I played this on Xbox 360 over a decade ago and only got the Steam version on sale, so I could play the mods. Now I thought I might give it another go as it's almost like playing a new game, since I don't remember any of the solutions. Still love this. The first time there was the added bonus that I didn't know the story, but this time, after playing (and getting stuck in) much harder mods, I'm managing to progress without guides. This is still one of the best puzzle games I have played, but I'm not looking forward to the final boss fight."
169165900,english,1,620,"Basically a must-play in my opinion, just an easy to pick up classic in the puzzle genre which probably everyone who calls themselves a gamer should have tried their hands at. Its also not a big time investment since its about solving puzzles not mindlessly grinding out for progression which is ideal for ""new"" gamers who dont want to invest too much time yet."
170271911,english,1,620,"The second part has really added to it and instead of stupid linear levels there is now more for the eyes and especially for the brain.   The character dialogues are funny, and you get insulted every now and then.   Along with Half-Life, one of the good games from Valve."
193802122,english,1,620,"I've replayed this game more times than I can count and I can confidently say that it will never, ever get old for me. From the moment little me launched this game, I was in love. Every year I come back to it, and every year it affects me just the same; whether that be the pure joy I feel rediscovering easter eggs I somehow forgot about, or the aching feeling I get when realizing I will never be able to play this for the very first time again -- it honestly, HONESTLY has impacted my life so greatly, more than any other game I know... and I have games with over 2k hours on it. But playtime be damned, this is my favorite game.   My friend had made a point that many games nowadays are similar in nature (with shooter games being the example used, however I can apply that to many, many other games). The fact that a 14 year old game, to me, surpasses these games that have graphics so intensive that [i]that's[/i] solely what it's known for is incredibly bittersweet, and yet, in a way, I wouldn't change it. The real charm of this game comes with the period of time it was made in (the golden age, I'd say), and due to the nature of post 2020 style games, I can't help but imagine that it would unfortunately end up like most media: popular for about a month, before being forgotten about in favor of something new. A game like Portal doesn't deserve that treatment.  That hasn't happened to Portal, or Half Life, or any of the notable Valve games, really. It's quiet, there's no official new content, but I always find myself stumbling across other Portal fans in the wild. If not the story, or the gameplay, or the funny shit you can do in co-op, then my favorite part of this game would purely be the timeless factor of it.   I've definitely rambled and this is a hell of a lot more dramatic than my other reviews, but I couldn't understand why I reviewed a fangame prior to this one. Maybe it's because I've never really been able to find the words to describe how much this game means to me. Like, literally, this whole block of text still doesn't do any justice on how much I love it."

191523547,english,1,620,Lovely game that continually keeps you entertained.  Puzzle solving with a good story.
181989520,english,1,620,"A masterclass in cooperative puzzle-solving, where teamwork and communication are key. The dual-portal mechanics create clever, mind-bending challenges that require coordination and trust. With witty banter from GLaDOS and brilliantly designed levels, it’s an unforgettable co-op experience."
183982985,english,1,620,"a banger game, definitely a must play for puzzle lovers + story is amazing, so many subtle hints and easter eggs hidden  Edit: I don't think giving a short sentence about this game is enough to give my experience with it justice so..  I definitely see why this is such a classic, well-beloved game by pretty much any gamer who has played it, and it is definitely one of the best story games I have personally played. Yes, it's old, but even in 2024, this never gets old.   From what I have heard, this game pretty much revolutionized the gaming industry and my god, there is nothing else like this. The puzzles can get challenging yes, but my no braincell ass brain managed to complete everything without even looking up the answers. I usually dislike games that make me genuinely think and analyze to solve puzzles for more than 5 minutes (I play games because I don't want to think at all) but I enjoyed this one a lot!   Not only that, the story is incredibly well-written too. Yes, there's tons of puzzles but the story bits are very interesting, and this is one of the games that forces you to explore to learn more about the lore and it's worth it. If you're a gamer who loves searching every corner of a room or environment, this is for you! Plus the dialogue is 100/10, hilarious characters with dark humor and it's not the cringey kind at all that you often see nowadays lol   I love love love this game and I definitely recommend it. Please play it!   p.s. The cake is a lie"
181738236,english,1,620,"I. Love. This. Game.  Fun mechanics, intriguing lore and, most importantly, a big woman robot that humiliates you constantly during your gameplay. Cinema."
191359950,english,1,620,"Played this after the first game, crazy graphics, the mechanics haven't really changed but still great game"
185221978,english,1,620,"Similar to Portal 1, very good solo puzzle/story game. And co-op is also fun."
175898905,english,1,620,"This game is really incredible. If your thinking of getting this game, buy it. I do think a lot of people buy this before portal one bc of either graphics or more content, but playing portal 1 really adds to the experience."
164868263,english,1,620,"Genuinely hands down the best sequel to ever exist in gaming. Expands on what the original layed out and left with a satisfying conclusion.   I couldn't put into words how much I actually have found a fond love for the Portal franchise, out of any game I've played never has something hooked me in so deeply that I actively go out and look for content about it and even have a desire to replay it. Hell one of my long time interests for a while now has been Sonic, and not even he has made me feel the same way Portal has.   I also loved Ellen McLain's and Stephen Merchant's performances respectively. Ellen's different approach on GLaDOS this game was something I didn't expect and it felt like Chell and her were forming a genuine bond.  Stephen also was a perfect fit for Wheatley, the witty responses that little moron gives are very incredibly funny and honestly I find myself quoting him and GLaDOS bickering lots.   All in all if you haven't played either Portal 1 or 2 you should. Hell even if you've played Portal 2 but only in co-op, I highly suggest the single player campaign. Words can't describe how much better it is to play rather than watch and you will cry..   That's where you come in.  You don't know pride.  You don't know fear.  You don't know anything.  You'll be perfect."
188981346,english,1,620,Portal 2 is one game I hesitated to get it but believe the reviews the game is super fun and challenging. Even in co op mode the levels are very intriguing there is no music just focus on the challenge with your friends. Game has very limited pieces of operation but complex combination which leads to interesting gameplay. Some levels were required lot of thinking to solve. Worth the time. If you like simple puzzle games. Best co-op I played till now.
185570956,english,1,620,"Portal 2 takes everything great about the first game and builds upon it: graphics, new mechanics, more interesting puzzles, even more lore. Nothing to add here from me, if you enjoyed Portal, you have to play this sequel."
183799834,english,1,620,Lovely and great puzzle game with physics as well.   Envoirement fits so well. Voice acting great.  Funny characters.  You can play it alone or together with a friend.  Had some good and fun hours with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Flexus711/]my Obu [/url]  I very much recommend this game to all of you! Definitely worth every Penny.  10/10 game!  Get Goo Goo Alu!
167278855,english,1,620,This game is amazing it has many cool parts and the lore is huge witch is amazing i like that we explore and see many test chambers the old facility its weird being the last human alive surrounded by robots and a evil ai overall its great it really puts you're mind to contribution the puzzles are interesting cool game.
186359306,english,1,620,I was not expecting to enjoy this and the first game so much. I'm. Not really the biggest fan of puzzle games. Honestly expected this to kinda suck. Even though I know valve makes peak games. But once I gave them a chance. I loved everything about them from gameplay to story to the hilarious humor. The puzzles really well designed really forced me to use my brain. But not confusing enoght to where I needed to search up the solution. Wish I could play them for the first time again. Would recommend to anyone who hasn't played them yet.
191502912,english,1,620,"It took 8 hours to finish but it took a long time to get rid of happiness that felt like a void in the middle of my chest. After the first game, the story of Glados and this place made my mind start understanding. The new features such as liquids, blue road and others made puzzles a lot interesting and harder than i thought. The quality of the game were beautiful. You can even play with your friends, that was a feature i didn't guess before playing the second game. A worthy game to pay without thinking."
167688051,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is basically just two games in one package, where you have the continuation of Portal One as a single-player adventure and the multiplayer story with ATLAS and P-Body. Honestly, finding fault in either of them is hard. The story mode builds upon what Portal One had already established in a great way, flinging you through an old familiar aperture science center but with a new rundown aesthetic, together with your robot NPC companion, who is just one of the funniest little orbs I've encountered to date. As for the multiplayer, let's just put it this way: I played through it with my friend, who made an anatomical observation and determined I had shown symptoms of something called ""big brain"". Sadly, it seems to have not been a permanent malady; alas, once in a while he will remind me of this diagnosis instead of giving a new complimentary observation. When reminded, he can be a bit of a lugnut when it comes to giving compliments. Overall, great game - worth every penny."
193704706,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a puzzle masterpiece, and its co-op mode? Absolute genius. Playing with a friend takes the game from brilliant to legendary. The puzzles are cleverly designed, and the way you and your partner need to work together to solve them is a perfect blend of challenge and hilarity.  It’s not just about figuring out the puzzles — it’s about timing, trust, and coordination. Every new level feels like a test of how well you and your partner can communicate and think on your feet. And with GLaDOS throwing sarcastic comments your way, it’s nonstop entertainment.  If you're looking for a co-op game that will test your brains, make you laugh, and leave you feeling accomplished after every puzzle, Portal 2 is one of the best out there. It’s a co-op experience that’s hard to beat."
179051045,english,1,620,"Portal 2 - a masterful blend of wit, innovation, and pure fun. The puzzles are brilliantly designed, offering a perfect mix of challenge and satisfaction. The story is engaging, with memorable characters and sharp humor. Whether playing solo or co-op, it’s an unforgettable experience that sets the bar high for puzzle-platformers. An absolute must-play for any gamer, especially if you have played the first instalment in the series!  My favourite moment in this entire game is The Part. The chapter popup on screen, the achievement, the dialogue and the wit, still think fondly about it today!"
167395321,english,1,620,"Nine distinct classes provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities. Constantly updated with new game modes, maps, equipment and, most importantly, hats!"
184478269,english,1,620,"I was delighted with the main game and got a lot of emotions, so I will definitely play the first part too. As for the joint game, the mechanics essentially do not change in any way, but it is very funny as a way of interaction. Not only do you fall together on the buttons, but also solve puzzles, from which sometimes your head hurts 😁 We often looked for more complex solutions, which are needed according to the plan :) In any case, it was fun and I did not consider the time wasted, because it was in high spirits."
191188536,english,1,620,"its a wonderful game that contains amazing puzzles and story especially the ending , i did not expect the ending to  be amazing like  this 10/10"
165344170,english,1,620,"fun game , puzzles dark humor good story for the least i've played it before and iam playing it again after 5 yers since my first playthrough and it still gives fun experience  Highly recomanded  note if u haven't play the fist one u have to play it its a must"
182661658,english,1,620,"Great game, solo or with friends very funny, better than 1(ofc what did you think) even considering that game pretty old. I reccomend to everyone, great story, big ammount of secret things as easter eggs, text on wall, and so on. I almost finished all achievments and dont regret not even second playing it."
180750001,english,1,620,"Legend. Masterpiece in game creation. The plot, the story, the technology, the dialogue, everything is perfect. This game follows Chell as she is tested by GLaDOS, a machine into whose memory Caroline's consciousness was implanted. Gabe Newell, thank you."
170991750,english,1,620,"An perfection amazing well done example of a sequel doing much more superior than the first original video game!!!!!!!!!!! Portal 2 is amazing yet can be tricky to figure out it's puzzles. But it's so much fun and rewarding to do so! Overall, Portal 2 feels a bit more fun and fair than the first game!"
170919215,english,1,620,"This game is unbelievably good. It's everything that the first game was... and more. Every level challenged me, to the point where about halfway through the game I took a break for a couple of years. Eventually, I came back to it (now as an adult) and thoroughly enjoyed every part of beating it. It's satisfying, funny, full of adventure, and worth every penny; I've bought the game at least three times on different platforms now, and have never once felt a shred of regret. I'm a little sad that Portal 3 doesn't have the mythological hype that GTA6 does, because I feel it's just as (if not more) deserved. I will most definitely replay this game in the future, and I would recommend it (and its predecessor, of course) to any human being who has ever enjoyed a video game. Easily 10/10, this is definitely one of my top 3 video games of all time.  TL;DR? Play the Portal game series. It's deservedly one of the GOAT."
169909660,english,1,620,"definitely the best puzzle game ever created and likely one of the best narratives too. you've played this game before, you know already. who doesn't like Portal 2? everyone from hardcore FPS gamers to your cool yet tech illiterate grandma can enjoy this. one of my all time favorites"
165685499,english,1,620,Deserves its status as one of the best games ever made. Superbly made puzzle mechanics wrapped up in an engaging story with outstanding writing & voice acting. Only a fool wouldn't release a third instalment in the franchise...
187932468,english,1,620,this gotta one of my favorite games to play in my free time its fun and has a good story and characters. the co op is fun aswell to play and so are the community maps i recommend
179507301,english,1,620,One of the best puzzle games (SP and Co-op) ever made. Top-tier writing and design. I recommend to everyone.
193877560,english,1,620,"not mad, so cool, game awesome, not irritatable at all, fren smart and not stoopid then game all fun"
193815605,english,1,620,An incredible sequel to an already good game that ties to the Half-Life universe I had a fun time playing and overall story was cool I enjoyed the accessibility to the workshop I also liked the extra content. I would for sure replay this game.
190858927,english,1,620,its such a fun game with hours of gameplay its really fun even if you havent played the prequel theres puzzles adventure and much more! and the co-op is really fun (plus if you cant play with anyone you can play with random people and comunicate via text voice chat or pings)
190841674,english,1,620,"Portal 2 was my first experience with the franchise, and it absolutely blew me away. While I haven’t gotten too far into the story yet, the multiplayer mode is where the game truly shines for me. My friend and I have spent countless hours laughing, strategizing, and tackling the cleverly designed puzzles. The game does an amazing job of accounting for every possible challenge, offering features like the ability to see your partner’s POV and a built-in text chat for seamless communication. Whether you’re in a call or not, teamwork feels intuitive and rewarding. Overall, I’d highly recommend Portal 2 to any group of friends looking for a fun, engaging, and cleverly designed co-op experience!"

The sequel improves on the first game in every single aspect thus creating a perfect sequel to an already a original game with unique design and concept. Portal 2 is nothing but spectacular game which remains to be exceptionally fun and rewarding despite having no violence and just pure puzzle solving. Not only the the 2nd game improves on everything; gameplay, story, challenge/difficulty, soundtrack, and duration, the game also adds a whole new campaign for the co-op experience which is very interesting and more than welcome addition!"
189921003,english,1,620,"Portal 2 will always be in my opinion Valve's best work right next to Half Life 2 the visuals, story, and overall gameplay it nails every aspect of it."
189782909,english,1,620,"S-tier, one of it's kinda game. I thank valve for adding native linux support to all their games. It ran perfectly on my system.   There is a certain charm to the game. Maybe it's the ""goofy [spoiler] Wheatley [/spoiler] and the snarky GlaDos"" or the cute turrets or the amazing puzzles.  The voice actors and dialogue/story writers did a marvellous job. They made the player feel that the robots are alive and gave an amazing personality to each of the characters. The level designers also did a great job at creating complex puzzles with a handful of mechanics. For some experienced players they might feel a bit too easy but I am sure that the Co-op and community made levels will satisfy their hunger for really hard brain challenging levels.  I have not played the Co-Op yet but I am looking forward to playing them as soon as possible. The game also has countless mods, if you are looking forward to buying this game I would like to suggest you to check out the Portal mods on steam after finishing the game if you would like to have MORE Portal! Have a good day <3."
189384861,english,1,620,A classic Valve puzzle game with both a single player and a 2 player coop campaign. And it manages to include top-notch voice acting and a genuinely compelling story. It's excellent and barely costs anything ; it really puts in perspective how the modern gaming industry has fallen off a cliff in recent years.   Everyone should experience this piece of video game history. [b]9/10[/b]
189383546,english,1,620,"Do you like puzzle solving games (for some reason) ? Also do you like games with lore and story? Portal 2 is just these and oh boy has valve done a great job making it enjoyable... I loved every part about this game (except from some, puzzles) and it's just so satisfying solving every puzzle. The v.a. is just great and the lore is interesting. Almost 10 hours in to it and I can see why people loved it. A valve classic.   Also I was blown away by the details and quality of the game. 100% recommend it!!!"
189233559,english,1,620,"It’s an extremely good game, very entertaining even though it might seem simple. My favorite part is listening to GLaDOS talk, and every level is even better than the last. The story is well set, and the graphics are incredible. Without a doubt, it’s an excellent game."
189141973,english,1,620,I probably screwed up when i decided to play the co-op first instead of the story but i digress. As im making this review i havent finished the story but im sure its good
188740788,english,1,620,"Here at Aperture Science we believe in unique mechanics, amazing storytelling, and top notch graphics. Portal 2 was and still is a very good game. It's easily one of the more replayable games out there. Thanks to the boys up in research development, there's always something you didn't notice before, or a way to solve a test that was different from the last time. Not only is the main story great, but the multiplayer Co-Op mode is loads of fun. Then there's the addition of community test chambers. There are so many great chambers out there, some even with their own custom story lines! Crowd Sourcing chambers was definitely the right direction! The game basically never ends! It's only over when your brain is fried from solving puzzles! Good one Caroline! All in all it's amazing game that will keep you engaged, and our investors happy. So get to testing, before I put you fighting the humanoid praying mantis horde! Cave Johnson out!"

Valve took the innovative mechanics of the original Portal and expanded them into a full-fledged, unforgettable experience filled with ingenious puzzles, top-tier storytelling, and dark humor that never gets old.  🧩 Brilliant Puzzle Design: The portal gun is back, and with new mechanics like gels, light bridges, and excursion funnels, every chamber feels fresh and rewarding. The game does an incredible job of gradually introducing new elements while keeping the challenge engaging.  🎭 Unmatched Writing & Voice Acting: GLaDOS returns with her signature sarcastic wit, but the new characters—especially Wheatley (voiced by Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J.K. Simmons)—steal the show with hilarious, yet compelling dialogue. The storytelling is immersive, and the plot twists are genuinely jaw-dropping.  🎮 Co-op Mode = Pure Fun: The cooperative mode is a masterpiece in itself. Solving puzzles with a friend while laughing at their inevitable portal mishaps is an experience like no other. The teamwork and communication required make for some of the best multiplayer moments in gaming.  🏆 A Must-Play for Everyone: Whether you love puzzle games, rich storytelling, or just experiencing a game with some of the best writing in history, Portal 2 is an absolute must-play. Even after all these years, it remains a gold standard for game design.  💙 Final Verdict: A flawless blend of humor, intelligence, and innovation. If you haven't played it yet, stop reading and play it NOW! 🚀🔵🟠  ✅ Score: 9/10 - A True Classic!"
188472978,english,1,620,definition of a perfect game 10/10 incredicle 2 player coop and best solo puzzle experience ever
188255771,english,1,620,"I knew Valve make some of the best games in the industry, but I did not expect a puzzle game from 2011 would hit this hard. The puzzles are extremely well-designed, so much so that solving them feels like watching your team winning last minute at a football match. The bots have more personalities than most modern RPG companions they expect you to fall in love with. And the chasing episodes are on par with some of the best action-adventure games I have played. To think I bought it with less than one USD feels practically unreal. 10/10"
187726506,english,1,620,"Ultimately, Portal 2 is pure genius. With gameplay that never stops becoming addictive and new characters that always threaten to steal the spotlight. A joy to play.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3424764171  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3424762891"
187583908,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a masterpiece. It takes everything great about the first game—mind-bending puzzles, clever mechanics, and dark humor—and expands on it massively. The level design is brilliant, introducing gels, excursion funnels, and light bridges that make puzzles even more interesting. The writing is top-tier, with hilarious dialogue from GLaDOS, Wheatley, and Cave Johnson. Plus, the co-op mode adds a whole new layer of fun and challenge."
186691067,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a weird game. Its such a different game to portal 1, core mechanics aside, that if feels somewhat tricky to compare the two. Lets start with the positive - gameplay. Portal 2 is much smoother than the first with a lot of neat tricks in its repertoire. It pretty much nails all the fundamentals and has less jank than the first. Negatives - this is a taste thing but I found the humour to be a bit overdone in 2. I thought 1's much more subtle approach to storytelling and comedy was more refined and compelling than 2's joke a minute style. Ultimately a great game though and a worthy sequel, well worth playing. Not finished the co op yet but its great so far!"
186602398,english,1,620,"This game is amazing, but it can be improved on.  1. it could be more fun if you added extra courses to play after story mode, and yes there are custom levels but sometimes you just get the same level over and over. 2. 3-4 player coop mode would be interesting and good for if you wanna play with your group of 3 or 4 friends but it could be a little chaotic. Last but not least, it would be nice to have some stuff for a portal game inbetween 1 and 2 and portal 3. Yes i know that there are mods like portal revolution and thinking with the time machine to fill those gaps but without anything not fanmade inbetween to fill the gaps i feel like i wasnt given the whole story, i mean i could go without portal 3 but something inbetween portal 1 and 2 is kinda necessary for this whole thing to feel whole."

185475748,english,1,620,"If you like portal 1, this game is going to be amazing. It takes portal 1 concepts, and expands them by a lot. Some puzzles are a bit more complicated than the original game, as they should be, and its definitely one of my favorite games ive played."

71607900,english,1,620,"[h1] Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to science[/h1]  Portal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to [b]T2: Judgement Day[/b] when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.  [h1]Pros[/h1] +The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot.  +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done.  +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this.  +[b]Stephen Merchant[/b] and [b]J.K Simmons[/b] did an absolutely terrific job. [b]Ellen McLain’s[/b] performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D +Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original! +Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times.  +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game.  +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by [b]Mike Morasky[/b] and [b]The National[/b].  +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend.  +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story.  +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo.  +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support. +Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free. +Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed.  +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support.  +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line.   [h1]Cons[/h1]  -First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV. -Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes.  -Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.    [h1]The Bottom Line[/h1] Portal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson; perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.  The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer.   Highly recommend it to……[b]everyone[/b]. If you’ve read so far then you’re probably interested in the game so won’t hurt giving it a try.   [h1]My Rating: 10/10 [/h1]   Thank You :D"

128382605,english,1,620,"Timeless masterpiece. A textbook example of how a video game should be. Splendid pacing, narrative always flows without major interruptions and the player is always in the action. Superb voice acting (JK Simmons, Ellen McLain, Nolan North) that brings characters to life.

14590312,english,1,620,"I have no idea why I waited so long to review this game. Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up. If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them! ------------------------------- [b]Intro[/b] You know how when you are on vacation and say, ""I am so glad it isn't winter right now.""? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about. ------------------------------- [b]Summary:[/b] This game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programmed-to-be ""idiot"" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play.  ------------------------------- [b]Multi-Player[/b] Then there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totally worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/load-outs into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/mental abilities. ------------------------------- [b]Other important things[/b] The many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the story-line, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.  To dumb it down: ------------------------------- [u][b]Pros[/b][/u] +Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful game-play.  +Wonderful audio and music for a great experience.  +Well-designed maps and challenges.  +Unlimited maps (user-created).  +Fantastic story-line.  +Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials).  +Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable. +Gender neutral. [u][b]++Helps with cognitive brain activity[/b][/u]. ------------------------------- [u][b]Cons[/b][/u] -Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1).  -Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here [spoiler]to me[/spoiler].) -Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.)  -Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.) ------------------------------- [b]My opinionated review[/b] I would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves. ------------------------------- [b]Rating[/b] Out of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing ""Portal transportation"" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definitely get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a [spoiler]97/100[/spoiler] after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating. ------------------------------- [b]Finally[/b] Thanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it! ~thedubmark (I write reviews now :))"
124813542,english,1,620,"An amazing sequel, not only does it keep the atmosphere of the first one, but also upgrades everything, mechanics, graphics, its longer and the story is just great, new characters that add so much more to the universe. Characters that you will never forget.  New puzzles of course that will challenge you and feel satisfying to complete. A beautiful ending and conclusion to Chell's story. It definitely will leave with a desire for more, that you can fulfill with the co-op mode or the myriad of chambers the community has been uploading over the years.

61960334,english,1,620,"Posted: April 17, 2011  The highest rated game on Steam, the best puzzle game ever fathomed, the 2nd best game ever created, and #1 worst dev moderation in history.   A game with limitless potential, with a limited ability to reach it.  A game with so much nostalgia, that it's players become forever stuck in 2011.  A game with such good comedy, that people mistake it for a sitcom instead of a puzzle game.  A puzzle game whose players don't like solving puzzles.  A game full of paradoxes (literally).  A game full of sarcasm. ;)  Really and truly, there is no other game like Portal 2 in existence, because there has never been another game that comes close to Portal 2's sheer amount of wasted potential. If only Valve would add a level editor and workshop, people would be able to play free, high quality puzzles indefinitely and never have to buy another game in their life. With the community in charge of creating content, there would be THOUSANDS of new maps for people to play and test their brains with every week! If I were to make predictions, this level editor should contain:  1. All Portal 2 test elements (including reflection gel and sendificators).  2. All the extra, Valve-made fizzler variants (not used in the main campaign for some odd reason).  3. All test elements from Portal 1, including cube deflectors, flux fields, positron orbs, and lifeform sensors.  4. The ability to choose between Portal 2's aesthetic styles (maybe even Portal 1), with matching element variants.  5. The ability to add custom background music from either game (I especially love ""Halted Production"" and ""Sin"").  6. An easy, resizable grid system for more complex and puzzle-relevant architecture.  7. An efficient brush compiler with optimized entity instances.  8. The ability to add custom music and screenshots.  9. Other cool and unique options for different test elements.  It's amazing how VALVe came up with all these cool new ideas; thank you so much for all your work! We can't wait to participate in all the future mapping competitions you'll hold! As for workshop integration, the only problem I foresee is people posting unsolvable puzzles on it. But if they just add a mechanic like Mario Maker where you have to beat your own level before publishing it, that should fix the issue. Oh wait, you say Mario Maker won't be released until 2015, and I just violated our NDA (no dissenters allowed) contract? Welp, guess I better change my identity and make a new account.

In case you don't know what's this about, read the Portal comic which tells about the event, ""Portal 2: Lab Rat"", I recommend it![/spoiler]).  The story takes a turn and we don't even know who to trust until the end.  The co-op mode is spectacular and quite fun.  The puzzles, compared to the first game, are more complex.  The sense of humour is present just as it was in the first game.  The gameplay doesn't change much compared to its predecessor.

42818803,english,1,620,"Apparently I haven't written a review for this game, so I guess I will now.  For starters, this game is the reason I got a Steam account in the first place. My brother's friend came over with the 360 disc and I stayed up all night playing. Then, of course, he took the game when he left. I immediately wanted to continue playing,  I was hooked from that point forward. Played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 FPS average. It was worth every second of it, honestly.   The campaign is, of course, one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming. The difficulty curve is well-done, the humor is always well-executed and there's tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens. Then, of course, the co-op is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and, of course, another person to cooperate with. I have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike, especially the moments where you have to decide if you REALLY want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partner's relying on. And, to top it all off, there's a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least time/portals with your friends. To this day I occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobody's beaten them, and it's always a pleasant surprise when someone has.  All in all, the game's simply amazing. If the fact that it's the #1 rated game on Steam with 121,015 Positive reviews to 1,586 Negative doesn't indicate its sheer quality, I don't know what will. It's a great game that came from a time when Valve still made them, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart."

134376735,english,1,620,"I bought this with my partner to play co-op together, and I think I speak for both of us when I say we enjoyed this game very much. We did the mistake of doing the extra *optional* difficult missions right away before doing the main story due to our lack of reading skills, which made things harder than necessary since we sort of skipped the tutorial, but it was a fun but challenging experience nonetheless. We have yet to finish the main co-op or the singleplayer missions, but I would like to praise the game regardless because it truly is a fun game to play where you have to use your brain a little, and when playing co-op you have to work together which was an overall very positive experience.  I will update my review after completing the game if it somehow changes my mind, but for 90% off on sale (cost ~ $1 USD) this game is an absolute steal and I cannot recommend it enough if you grab it while discounted. The game may be old, but the graphics hold up pretty good I would say."

177402372,english,1,620,Hilarious dialogue. Deep lore. Difficult puzzle experience. These things make this game and it's prequel my favorite video games I've played. Only complaint is there's not a third game.
28688378,english,1,620,"Honestly I'm still baffled and I'm clueless how to start this review. I'm still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel. I can't wait to jump into the co-op function honestly since the singleplayer was this good.  Valve literally took a look at Portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel. They added new general features like a loading screen, which I didn't find mandatory, and you can see where your portals are placed through walls. They stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map. Speaking of puzzles, they added so many, that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel. They added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want.  You have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land. You have bridges to guide you around the map. You also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button. Finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white. Red gel gives you a speed boost. Blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it, mainly for places that you couldn't portal on before.  Obviously the things previously said aren't the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment. The story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences. It also contains a few plot twists here and there. The places you visit are fairly new but you'll visit some well remembered places from portal. Something they also introduced is companions, the most part of the game you'll have a object travelling with you. One of them is a funny little core with a british accent. Aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths. The jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh.  I highly recommend  that you buy this game, and play it for the rest of the day or week. Turn off your notification, because the game doesn't support tabbing, and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story. (Edit:) You also can choose from many maps from the community to test out so you won't get tired of the story and you can still play."
171628798,english,1,620,"God, it's amazing how well this game holds up even after more than a decade. Both the singleplayer and co-op experiences are top tier in their own way. The voice acting is simply spectacular, the story is intriguing and the puzzles get progressively harder throughout the game (thus providing you with a nice learning curve). This sequel overall is a great step up from the first game and a must-have for virtually any gamer I'd say."
124756887,english,1,620,"One of the greatest games of all time. Your life will be changed, having played it. The writing is hilarious, the story is heart warming and triumphant. The characters are the life of the party. Throw in challenging physics puzzles, witty banter, and the constant threat of doom makes for a story and gameplay that you'll remember for years. The comments and banter get even more meta if the you've played the first one."
142783653,english,1,620,"Prepare yourselves for a sequel that's as witty as a stand-up comedy routine and as mind-bending as a Rubik's cube on steroids. Portal 2, the brainchild of Valve, is a masterclass in puzzle-solving, humor, and creativity that will leave you scratching your head and clutching your sides in laughter. So, let's dive into this Portal to discover why it's more than just a cake-filled lie.  Gameplay and Puzzles: Portal 2 picks up where its predecessor left off, throwing you back into the test chambers of Aperture Science like an unwilling lab rat. Armed with the iconic portal gun, you'll face an array of puzzles that will have you pondering like a philosopher in a think tank.  The puzzles in Portal 2 are as varied as a box of assorted chocolates. From ingenious tests of spatial reasoning to brain-bending platforming challenges, the game keeps you on your toes like a ballet dancer auditioning for a circus. It's like an exhilarating dance of portals, where each move is as precise as a surgeon's scalpel.  But fear not; if you ever find yourself stuck like a fly in honey, the solution is often simpler than a toddler's toy. The ""Aha!"" moments you experience after finally cracking a puzzle are as satisfying as pulling off a magic trick that leaves your audience in awe.  Narrative and Humor: Beyond the puzzles, Portal 2 is a storytelling triumph that will captivate you like a bard's ballad. The game continues the saga of Chell and GLaDOS, the AI with a knack for dark humor and the occasional compliment. GLaDOS's snarky remarks are as sharp as a ninja's shuriken, and her wit will keep you entertained like a comedic duo on stage.  The game introduces new characters like Wheatley, a bumbling personality core with a penchant for bumbling and hilarious British charm. Wheatley's antics add a layer of levity to the experience, like adding sprinkles to an already delightful cupcake.  The narrative unfolds like a captivating novel, keeping you hooked from start to finish like a fish on a line. You'll find yourself emotionally invested in the fate of Chell and the Aperture Science facility, even as you laugh at GLaDOS's passive-aggressive remarks.  Cooperative Multiplayer: Ah, but Portal 2's delights don't end there. The game boasts a cooperative multiplayer mode that's as delightful as having a partner in crime. Working together with a friend (or perhaps a friendly rival) to solve intricate puzzles and communicate through in-game gestures is as charming as watching a synchronized dance routine.  The cooperative puzzles require seamless teamwork and communication, which can lead to hilarious moments of miscommunication and botched portal placements. But remember, in the world of Portal 2, even the most disastrous mistakes can end in peals of laughter.  Graphics and Sound: Portal 2's visual design is as polished as a shiny new Aperture Science test chamber. The environments are a testament to the game's attention to detail, from the decaying ruins of the facility to the pristine test chambers that beckon you like a magician's invitation.  The sound design is equally impressive, with a captivating soundtrack that complements the gameplay like a well-timed drumbeat. The voice acting, particularly the performances of GLaDOS and Wheatley, is nothing short of stellar, deserving accolades like a standing ovation.  Challenging and Rewarding: Portal 2 isn't afraid to challenge your intellect like a sparring match with a grandmaster. But fear not, for the game is as rewarding as a treasure chest filled with rare loot. Each puzzle you conquer feels like an intellectual victory, and the moments of revelation are as delightful as unwrapping a long-awaited gift.  Conclusion: In conclusion, Portal 2 is a sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it in every way like a magician pulling off an awe-inspiring illusion. Its puzzles will twist your mind like a pretzel, and its humor will leave you in stitches like a comedy show.  So, if you're ready to embark on an adventure that's as intellectually stimulating as it is hilarious, enter the world of Portal 2. Whether you're a returning fan of the series or a newcomer to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, prepare to be captivated by the wit, charmed by the characters, and enthralled by the puzzles.  Grab your portal gun, put on your thinking cap, and get ready for a mind-warping, side-splitting experience. Portal 2 is more than just a sequel; it's a comedic masterpiece of puzzle-solving, storytelling, and unforgettable moments. Now, let's open those portals and step through to a world of laughter and brain-teasing delight!"
57536665,english,1,620,"Great coop puzzle game that in a short time span will make you feel dumb as rocks and smarter than Einstein. My wife and I strengthened our marriage bond through this teamwork game and luckily, we were pretty much even as far as figuring stuff out. ;)"
1110736,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun. At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact. The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well. One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay. Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player. I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter.  Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.

78206593,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a phenomenal game by Valve and a true successor to its first one. Not my first time playing this, I've played this before Steam like 4 times and now this completing it in 6 hours is kinda short, looking forward to trying the co-op. Such an amazing story, visuals, gameplay, everything on par especially the design of the gigantic structures just like how in Half-Life there's Black Mesa. Not to forget about the voice acting, in general, is ""the cherry on top"", IMO J.K Simmons nailed it voicing ""Cave Johnson"" making me imagine how his facial expression was every time he talks. I wish if there is a new Portal game in the works or going to be, who knows. Overall, Highly recommended, every gamer or a newcomer should play this. 10/10"
32285117,english,1,620,"DAMN this game is good. I think at this point everyone knows what the Portal series is, so I'll just point out some of the highlights. The story is great with interesting characters and a perfect pace. The plot twists are well done and it only tells you what you need to know. The story is also supplemented by the great humor. Of course it's a puzzle game, so the puzzles and level design need to be good. Luckily, they're done flawlessly. On top of that the environments are also amazing and add lots to the world. Once you're done with the story mode there's a level creator that is perfectly made and allows you to do just about anything you want. People have used this to make some crazy and amazing levels.

70379413,english,1,620,"Reviewing games I played a long time ago:  I'm usually not a person prone to hyperbolize, but Portal 2 is, after almost a decade, still one of the best games ever made. It's not easy to follow up to a groundbreaking game like Portal, but this sequel is really something special."
10527581,english,1,620,"Portal was sort of a little experiment of a huge company. That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.  　STILL ALIVE?  　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.  　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER  　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.  　ENDLESS TESTS  　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.  　Multiplayer: 　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ  　　Co-op:    ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Storyline:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Graphics:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺  　  　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.  　　　　[i]VALVe made another good 　　game. With good intelligent humor, 　　charismatic characters and unusual 　　interesting gameplay.  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　As expected, nine out of ten [9/10]."

114069283,english,1,620,there is no describable feeling for the pang of sadness I get whenever I replay a Valve game knowing they will never put their all into a game ever again. Alyx is nice but the earlier half-life games and portal were something special.
49246649,english,1,620,"I cannot believe it took me this long to write a review about this game. I wrote an essay about how good it is for an English class before I wrote a review talking about how good it is.  Long overdue, I honestly don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece. This game is hands down the best one I have ever played in my life. An improvement on the first one in all the right ways, this game is potentially the only singleplayer experience I have had a proper craving for, the only experience that I have genuinely felt that going back and replaying is the thing I want to be doing.  In the essay that I wrote about Portal 2, I spoke at length about all of the fancy rhetoric that the game employs to convey various emotions and force the player into a mindset. The big thing I noticed was how well the game uses the physically small map to portray this MASSIVE sense of scale. In the essay I focused more on how it forces the player into experiencing something akin to a ""trapped freedom"", where you have the opportunity to do whatever you want but in a certain space. In retrospect, I should simply have written about the way that the game conveys lonely companionship, fearful trust, and reliance on someone openly trying to kill you. It tears out your deepest emotions and plays with them, trying to and succeeding in making you feel two conflicting emotions simultaneously. This is a powerful way to write a story and Portal 2 pulls it off flawlessly.  With a mix of top-tier voice acting, fluid animation, realistic interactions, interesting characters, an amazing story, the usage of a silent protagonist, and the lack of cutscenes entirely, the game feels realistic and involved. The game doesn't break immersion for a second. While remaining tense, it manages to employ humour, and does everything tastefully.  I can't rave about everything in one review because it frankly will turn into another 20 page essay like the last one did. The TL;DR of this is that the game does everything a game should do flawlessly.   This is the best game ever made and nothing can change my mind."

The campaign is much larger than the previous one, with a bunch of new mechanics as well. What really shines here though is the fantastic voice acting from the antagonists, Wheatley is hilarious with his british accent and GLaDOS just being cynical and awesome as always! It has a lot more challenges as well and the multiplayer works perfectly.   The game is a masterpiece indeed!"

187593044,english,1,620,"Rating: 10/10  Developed by Valve and released in 2011, Portal 2 is a masterpiece of puzzle-platforming, featuring brilliant level design, sharp humor, and one of the most memorable narratives in gaming. Expanding on the mechanics of the original Portal (2007), this sequel introduces new puzzle elements, a longer and richer story, and an incredibly fun co-op mode. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys brain-teasing challenges and witty writing.  Why Portal 2 is a Masterpiece 🧩 Brilliant Puzzle Mechanics The core of Portal 2’s gameplay remains the portal gun, allowing players to create two connected portals to navigate through puzzles. However, this sequel introduces new elements like:  Excursion Funnels (tractor beams that carry objects and players) Repulsion Gel (bouncy surfaces for high jumps) Propulsion Gel (speed-enhancing surfaces) Light Bridges and Aerial Faith Plates Each of these elements adds depth and variety, keeping puzzles fresh throughout the campaign.  🎭 Incredible Writing and Humor Portal 2’s dialogue is legendary. The writing team, led by Erik Wolpaw, delivers some of the funniest and smartest lines in gaming history. GLaDOS, the sarcastic AI antagonist, returns with passive-aggressive insults and dark humor, while Wheatley, voiced by Stephen Merchant, provides an energetic and often hilarious presence. The game’s humor is perfectly balanced, making it both funny and deeply engaging.  🏢 Expanded World-Building Unlike the first game, which mostly took place in sterile test chambers, Portal 2 explores the history of Aperture Science. Players venture into old, decayed sections of the facility, uncovering audio logs of Cave Johnson, the eccentric founder of Aperture. This deeper lore makes the world feel more alive and mysterious.  🤝 Co-op Mode – A Perfect Two-Player Experience Portal 2 features a fully-fledged cooperative mode, where two players control Atlas and P-Body, two testing robots. Co-op puzzles require teamwork, timing, and communication, making it one of the best cooperative experiences in gaming. It’s brilliantly designed, ensuring both players feel equally involved in solving the challenges.  🎶 Memorable Soundtrack Portal 2’s soundtrack, composed by Mike Morasky, features dynamic music that adapts to player actions. The game also ends with another hilarious song from GLaDOS, ""Want You Gone"", following up on the iconic ""Still Alive"" from the first game.  Are There Any Flaws? ❌ Some Puzzles May Feel Too Easy for Veterans Compared to the original Portal, some experienced puzzle-solvers might find Portal 2’s difficulty a bit more forgiving. However, the co-op mode and community-created test chambers provide plenty of challenging content.  ❌ No Portal 3... Yet The biggest flaw? Valve never made a Portal 3. 😢  Conclusion Portal 2 is a masterpiece that balances clever puzzle design, fantastic humor, and deep world-building into an unforgettable experience. Whether you're playing solo or with a friend, the game delivers one of the most rewarding and entertaining adventures ever made. It remains one of Valve’s greatest achievements and is highly recommended for any gamer.  🔹 Rating: 10/10 – Brilliant puzzles, unforgettable characters, and one of the best co-op experiences in gaming."
135872966,english,1,620,Portal2 is on my list of favorite games that I like to go back and revisit every year or so. I have yet to play a game that has impressed me as much as Portal2. Some come close but the engaging puzzles and intriguing story are hard to beat. I really hope they make a true Portal3 or Half-Life/Portal crossover and continue the story.  *side note: I originally played this on a console but find it's much easier to play advanced levels with a mouse and keyboard.
186970926,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.  One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.  Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.  Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.  Overall, Portal"
82985743,english,1,620,"In my playtime, I felt proud for not looking the answers online, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment without giving me a Brain Damage.  Portal 2 definitely live up to what people say about it, the game is Overwhelming and have the right to be considered [b] One of the Best Puzzle Games [/b] created to date, it is really a Must play for PC Gaming, even if you are not into Puzzle games like myself... I will talk about the most striking things for me during my playtime and some thoughts about it.  [list]   [*]  [u] [b] Storyline [/b] [/u] – The Story has improved a lot since the first game, there is now a more noticeable narrative, between the Old Villain (Glados), a new character (Whitley) and the playable character (Chell). There is also a lot from the Origin of the Aperture Science, making it an interesting and solid game to go through.  [*]  [u] [b] Challenging and Mechanics [/b] [/u] – The game has a base mechanic, the Portal Gun, a weapon that shoot 2 different portals that you can go through… It might be simple, but the game keeps giving you new things to work with along the chapters, making it a lot more Challenging as you go further in the game.  [*]  [u] [b] Comedy [/b] [/u] – This game is Hilarious, not only from the well written jokes spoken by  the characters, but the environment has some hidden details that are so funny as well, I would definitely recommend you to read the plaques and frames around the map.  [*]  [u] [b] Aged like Wine [/b] [/u] – Portal 2 was released in April of 2011, back then it was revolutionary, it was a brand new game with new features and mechanics, today, it is not much different, the Graphics is fairly decent and the game still unique. The best thing is that Portal 2 is a lot cheaper than it once was.  [*]  [u] [b] Co-op [/b] [/u] – As Atlas and P-Body, you can play this mode with one more friend and enjoy a variety of more Levels, now with 4 different Portals to work with, which makes the Levels much more complex. The Co-op mode not only uses the already introduced mechanics very well, but it also gives a little touch to the main Story.  [/list]  When I think about it, makes me really impressed that this game was released more than 9 years ago, and it still a [b] Unique [/b] and [b] Original [/b] puzzle game. Portal 2 is a much-improved version from Portal 1, a game that was already great, but this one is a refined version and brought the potential it had… And I must praise the [b] Voice Acting [/b], one of the best features and contribute a lot for it being so Iconic.  Is understandable why people are always memeing and asking for Valve to make more games of every franchise they have; the quality of their games is top notch… Maybe their secret is that they took a long time to develop, from the idea to the playability… We just have to keep waiting.  [u] [b] Rate: 9.2/10.0 [/b] [/u]"

24334460,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in April 2011. Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.  Portal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.  The dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.  The co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.  [h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1] Portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience.

67688868,english,1,620,"[h1]Great game[/h1]  Portal 2 is a continuation of a very good first part. The game is based on the same mechanisms as the first part, and adds elements that make the game better.  I'm mainly talking about cooperation mode. It's done so well that I think it's more interesting than the single player mode and more fun to play. Of course the storyline is very good, but the ability to solve puzzles with a friend appeals to me more. The boards are made in such a way that we are unlikely to finish them by ourselves and the cooperation is very important here.  Of course, our main object that we need to complete the game is the gun portal, just like in the previous part. It does not introduce any innovations, it works on the same principle as before, that is, it can create two portals between which we can move.  We need to mention the riddles that await us during the game. We will come across simple, trivial puzzles, which will take us literally a while to solve, but we will also find some that we will have to spend more time on. This discrepancy makes the game more diverse and friendly even for younger players.  The graphics are very good for the year of the game release. The locations are nice, they contain various details, despite the old engine, the graphics can really make an amazing impression.  [h1]Summary[/h1]  Portal 2 is definitely one of the best games I've played. It's hard to find any mistakes, the game is just great. We have an interesting storyline, good cooperation mode, easy and difficult puzzles. All in all, the only thing I can attach to is a few bugs, but they are so few that they do not affect the pleasure of the game.

38663794,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece. The voice acting is some of the best that I've ever heard, the puzzles are just hard enough, the game runs beautifully. It is just enjoyable if you look at the single player. If you've considered buying this game and haven't yet, do it! The only bad part about this game is that, now that I'm finished with it, I can never experience it for the first time again.  Next Target - Co-Op Campaign"
137189353,english,1,620,"One of the best games I've ever played. Amazing mechanics, awsome  story and great graphics. Congrats to the developers. 10/10. This need a sequel 100%."
35453186,english,1,620,"'Portal 2' may just be the most enjoyable single-player game I have ever played - and I will provide you with five reasons why!  - Firstly, the dialogue is brilliant; - The story is surprisingly engaging, and your 'companion', Wheatley, is highly entertaining, although perhaps a little too talkative for some;  - The atmosphere is highly immersive, with a variety of settings ranging from - without spoiling too much - underground to laboratories to factories; - Very rewarding puzzles that challenge you without becoming monotonous or frustrating. This is entirely subjective, though, so some of you may dissent from this view; and - The co-op mode provides more content to enjoy with a friend. Truth be told, I found this mode to be more enjoyable than the single-player! And to that end, the prospect of replaying the co-op mode is certainly appealing IF you are fortunate enough to a) have more than 1 friend who owns the game, and b) own more than one friend.   11/10 GET THE GAME!"
76774117,english,1,620,"Another 𝘤𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘤 game you have to try at least once. Great puzzles that will make you feel like the smartest person on the world, while also maintaining a good storyline with just fantastic characters. I have to say that I think the voice acting is one of the best features of the game, they certainly help make every character be more memorable. Purely because of the voice acting, I can remember what every character's attitude was like despite that it has been 𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘴 since I first played! The campaign and story might be a tad short and some maps might look a bit repetitive, but I personally don't think those are a huge con. Everything else about the game gives shines brighter than a couple small faults. Even after the campaign, you can try out coop or many of the workshop maps! You can continue the magic after the victory from the finale, and there are some 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 creative maps out there. Invite your friend to play and it'll definitely feel like a smart bonding session you should enjoy. Overall, I think this is a great game suited for every type of gamer and I definitely enjoyed it."
110963638,english,1,620,"Where do I even start? First of all the story is awesome and can be replayed so much without loosing its value. The puzzles are difficult but not too difficult to make it infuriating, once you finish a really hard puzzle you feel so much accomplishment. The co-op is one of the best co-op games I have ever played, it has a great story and actually feels like its meant to be a part of the game instead of just some afterthought. There are community made maps for single player and co-op, there are so many well made community maps that feel like they were produced by a game studio. You can even make your own map if you wanted to. SOOO many easter eggs and secrets in this game its unreal. There are barely any glitches that you can just run into during game play. Even the title screen changes depending on where you are in the game. The community for this game is insane. Speedrunning this game is insane, if you somehow feel like you are getting bored of this game, then try speedrunning it. This is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. Oh and i forgot to mention... THE CUSTOM MODS FOR THIS GAME IS INSANE!!!! If you have this game you should really consider downloading the mods for this game, some even just straight up make a whole new game with new mechanics and a whole story with new characters and its just the coolest thing ever, examples are: Portal Stories Mel, Portal Reloaded and Aperture Tag just to name a tiny amount of them. This game is perhaps one of, if not my most favourite game of all time.   TL;DR : Portal 2 is good game, lots to do, 10/10"

It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.  In the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.  After that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.  And to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game.  It is a gift that just keeps on giving.  With the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, [b]Portal 2[/b] rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games.  It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence.  If you haven’t yet tried it, now is the time.  There are hours of entertainment waiting for you.

64219641,english,1,620,"Amazing game. Truly defines the puzzle genre, while acting as a great sequel to portal. Read the end for a TL:DR.  Campaign is flawless. It offers a more in-depth journey through aperture that the first game could never accomplish with the original source engine. Campaign characters: Lovable, Exciting, and not annoying. One thing that games forget to do is make their characters good. This game does that in just the right way that it feels like you've built a connection to the characters. Puzzles are easy once you've mastered them, (as I have) but harder once you first play through the game.  Co-op: Amazing. Taking place after the events of the singleplayer campaign, you and your friend (maybe someone who's played the campaign before), can have a really fun time playing. Level editor: Easy and fun to use. I really enjoy building levels for this game, and it shows based on how many I've made. You can also use the hammer editor to build more in-depth and custom levels, but if you are new to level design and want something simple to start you out, this game is for you.  Community levels: Sometimes fun, sometimes boring. You never really know what you're going to get with a level from the workshop. It could be either be a masterpiece made with the hammer editor, or a test chamber made by a 5 year old who thought walking to the exit without having a puzzle was hard. There are also co-op community levels that can yet again be played with your buddy! If you and your partner had a really fun time playing, then you'll probably enjoy working together to beat community levels. Of course you still never know what you're gonna get.  Community mods or 6 part levels: These just add more game that you would want to replay. There are some really good standalone free mods on the steam shop right now if you want to pick them up. Some really good steam mods: Portal stories: Mel, Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Inititive, Thinking with Time Machine. Here is a list of some 6-part levels that I would personally recommend: Wheatley's Unscientific Tests, Minecraft in Portal 2, COSMOGNY and many more.  Only bad point in this game: There are co-op cosmetics that are not required but still act as in-app purchases if you are so inclined to buy them. The entire store is only about 10 dollars which kinda balances it out though.  TL:DR: Campaign is really good. Co-op is really fun. Level editor is a excellent introduction to level design. Community levels you really don't know what you're gonna get. (Played 6 hours of custom levels today and I wanted to die at the end) Includes Co-op community levels so you and your partner can want to die together. (Sarcasm)  FINAL REVIEW: Finally, right? 8/10 Valve, you've knocked it out of the park once again. Hopefully Half life: Alyx will bring us the same experience.  MODERN EDIT: lemme add to this essay a bit, first of all, i first saw this game in the window of a gamestop, on one of those big posters around the time when it came out (i was small and unable to play video games) i really liked the co-op robots, so a while later i finally played it, and ever since i played portal 1, (not so much portal 2) i've absolutely fallen in love with the source engine, so this franchise singlehandedly changed my life in an absolutely insane way, i am now going to go to college for computer engineering and will attempt to get a job at valve (will update if that happens)"

71607900,english,1,620,"[h1] Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to science[/h1]  Portal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to [b]T2: Judgement Day[/b] when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.  [h1]Pros[/h1] +The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot.  +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done.  +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this.  +[b]Stephen Merchant[/b] and [b]J.K Simmons[/b] did an absolutely terrific job. [b]Ellen McLain’s[/b] performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D +Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original! +Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times.  +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game.  +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by [b]Mike Morasky[/b] and [b]The National[/b].  +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend.  +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story.  +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo.  +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support. +Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free. +Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed.  +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support.  +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line.   [h1]Cons[/h1]  -First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV. -Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes.  -Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.    [h1]The Bottom Line[/h1] Portal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson; perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.  The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer.   Highly recommend it to……[b]everyone[/b]. If you’ve read so far then you’re probably interested in the game so won’t hurt giving it a try.   [h1]My Rating: 10/10 [/h1]   Thank You :D"

If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them! ------------------------------- [b]Intro[/b] You know how when you are on vacation and say, ""I am so glad it isn't winter right now.""? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about. ------------------------------- [b]Summary:[/b] This game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programmed-to-be ""idiot"" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play.  ------------------------------- [b]Multi-Player[/b] Then there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totally worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/load-outs into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/mental abilities. ------------------------------- [b]Other important things[/b] The many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the story-line, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.  To dumb it down: ------------------------------- [u][b]Pros[/b][/u] +Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful game-play.  +Wonderful audio and music for a great experience.  +Well-designed maps and challenges.  +Unlimited maps (user-created).  +Fantastic story-line.  +Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials).  +Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable. +Gender neutral. [u][b]++Helps with cognitive brain activity[/b][/u]. ------------------------------- [u][b]Cons[/b][/u] -Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1).  -Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here [spoiler]to me[/spoiler].) -Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.)  -Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.) ------------------------------- [b]My opinionated review[/b] I would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves. ------------------------------- [b]Rating[/b] Out of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing ""Portal transportation"" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definitely get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a [spoiler]97/100[/spoiler] after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating. ------------------------------- [b]Finally[/b] Thanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it! ~thedubmark (I write reviews now :))"
124813542,english,1,620,"An amazing sequel, not only does it keep the atmosphere of the first one, but also upgrades everything, mechanics, graphics, its longer and the story is just great, new characters that add so much more to the universe. Characters that you will never forget.  New puzzles of course that will challenge you and feel satisfying to complete. A beautiful ending and conclusion to Chell's story. It definitely will leave with a desire for more, that you can fulfill with the co-op mode or the myriad of chambers the community has been uploading over the years.  Just get it as soon as you can, and make sure you play Portal 1 first so you can enjoy 2 the most."

61960334,english,1,620,"Posted: April 17, 2011  The highest rated game on Steam, the best puzzle game ever fathomed, the 2nd best game ever created, and #1 worst dev moderation in history.   A game with limitless potential, with a limited ability to reach it.  A game with so much nostalgia, that it's players become forever stuck in 2011.  A game with such good comedy, that people mistake it for a sitcom instead of a puzzle game.  A puzzle game whose players don't like solving puzzles.  A game full of paradoxes (literally).  A game full of sarcasm. ;)  Really and truly, there is no other game like Portal 2 in existence, because there has never been another game that comes close to Portal 2's sheer amount of wasted potential. If only Valve would add a level editor and workshop, people would be able to play free, high quality puzzles indefinitely and never have to buy another game in their life. With the community in charge of creating content, there would be THOUSANDS of new maps for people to play and test their brains with every week! If I were to make predictions, this level editor should contain:  1. All Portal 2 test elements (including reflection gel and sendificators).  2. All the extra, Valve-made fizzler variants (not used in the main campaign for some odd reason).  3. All test elements from Portal 1, including cube deflectors, flux fields, positron orbs, and lifeform sensors.  4. The ability to choose between Portal 2's aesthetic styles (maybe even Portal 1), with matching element variants.  5. The ability to add custom background music from either game (I especially love ""Halted Production"" and ""Sin"").  6. An easy, resizable grid system for more complex and puzzle-relevant architecture.  7. An efficient brush compiler with optimized entity instances.  8. The ability to add custom music and screenshots.  9. Other cool and unique options for different test elements.  It's amazing how VALVe came up with all these cool new ideas; thank you so much for all your work! We can't wait to participate in all the future mapping competitions you'll hold! As for workshop integration, the only problem I foresee is people posting unsolvable puzzles on it. But if they just add a mechanic like Mario Maker where you have to beat your own level before publishing it, that should fix the issue. Oh wait, you say Mario Maker won't be released until 2015, and I just violated our NDA (no dissenters allowed) contract? Welp, guess I better change my identity and make a new account. See you in court, mate."

The story takes a turn and we don't even know who to trust until the end.  The co-op mode is spectacular and quite fun.  The puzzles, compared to the first game, are more complex.

42818803,english,1,620,"Apparently I haven't written a review for this game, so I guess I will now.  For starters, this game is the reason I got a Steam account in the first place. My brother's friend came over with the 360 disc and I stayed up all night playing. Then, of course, he took the game when he left. I immediately wanted to continue playing,  I was hooked from that point forward. Played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 FPS average. It was worth every second of it, honestly.   The campaign is, of course, one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming. The difficulty curve is well-done, the humor is always well-executed and there's tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens. Then, of course, the co-op is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and, of course, another person to cooperate with. I have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike, especially the moments where you have to decide if you REALLY want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partner's relying on. And, to top it all off, there's a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least time/portals with your friends. To this day I occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobody's beaten them, and it's always a pleasant surprise when someone has.  All in all, the game's simply amazing. If the fact that it's the #1 rated game on Steam with 121,015 Positive reviews to 1,586 Negative doesn't indicate its sheer quality, I don't know what will. It's a great game that came from a time when Valve still made them, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart."

134376735,english,1,620,"I bought this with my partner to play co-op together, and I think I speak for both of us when I say we enjoyed this game very much. We did the mistake of doing the extra *optional* difficult missions right away before doing the main story due to our lack of reading skills, which made things harder than necessary since we sort of skipped the tutorial, but it was a fun but challenging experience nonetheless. We have yet to finish the main co-op or the singleplayer missions, but I would like to praise the game regardless because it truly is a fun game to play where you have to use your brain a little, and when playing co-op you have to work together which was an overall very positive experience.  I will update my review after completing the game if it somehow changes my mind, but for 90% off on sale (cost ~ $1 USD) this game is an absolute steal and I cannot recommend it enough if you grab it while discounted.

177402372,english,1,620,Hilarious dialogue. Deep lore. Difficult puzzle experience. These things make this game and it's prequel my favorite video games I've played. Only complaint is there's not a third game.
28688378,english,1,620,"Honestly I'm still baffled and I'm clueless how to start this review. I'm still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel. I can't wait to jump into the co-op function honestly since the singleplayer was this good.  Valve literally took a look at Portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel. They added new general features like a loading screen, which I didn't find mandatory, and you can see where your portals are placed through walls. They stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map. Speaking of puzzles, they added so many, that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel. They added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want.  You have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land. You have bridges to guide you around the map. You also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button. Finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white. Red gel gives you a speed boost. Blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it, mainly for places that you couldn't portal on before.  Obviously the things previously said aren't the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment. The story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences. It also contains a few plot twists here and there. The places you visit are fairly new but you'll visit some well remembered places from portal. Something they also introduced is companions, the most part of the game you'll have a object travelling with you. One of them is a funny little core with a british accent. Aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths. The jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh.  I highly recommend  that you buy this game, and play it for the rest of the day or week. Turn off your notification, because the game doesn't support tabbing, and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story. (Edit:) You also can choose from many maps from the community to test out so you won't get tired of the story and you can still play."
171628798,english,1,620,"God, it's amazing how well this game holds up even after more than a decade. Both the singleplayer and co-op experiences are top tier in their own way. The voice acting is simply spectacular, the story is intriguing and the puzzles get progressively harder throughout the game (thus providing you with a nice learning curve). This sequel overall is a great step up from the first game and a must-have for virtually any gamer I'd say."
124756887,english,1,620,"One of the greatest games of all time. Your life will be changed, having played it. The writing is hilarious, the story is heart warming and triumphant. The characters are the life of the party. Throw in challenging physics puzzles, witty banter, and the constant threat of doom makes for a story and gameplay that you'll remember for years. The comments and banter get even more meta if the you've played the first one."
142783653,english,1,620,"Prepare yourselves for a sequel that's as witty as a stand-up comedy routine and as mind-bending as a Rubik's cube on steroids. Portal 2, the brainchild of Valve, is a masterclass in puzzle-solving, humor, and creativity that will leave you scratching your head and clutching your sides in laughter. So, let's dive into this Portal to discover why it's more than just a cake-filled lie.  Gameplay and Puzzles: Portal 2 picks up where its predecessor left off, throwing you back into the test chambers of Aperture Science like an unwilling lab rat. Armed with the iconic portal gun, you'll face an array of puzzles that will have you pondering like a philosopher in a think tank.  The puzzles in Portal 2 are as varied as a box of assorted chocolates. From ingenious tests of spatial reasoning to brain-bending platforming challenges, the game keeps you on your toes like a ballet dancer auditioning for a circus. It's like an exhilarating dance of portals, where each move is as precise as a surgeon's scalpel.  But fear not; if you ever find yourself stuck like a fly in honey, the solution is often simpler than a toddler's toy. The ""Aha!"" moments you experience after finally cracking a puzzle are as satisfying as pulling off a magic trick that leaves your audience in awe.  Narrative and Humor: Beyond the puzzles, Portal 2 is a storytelling triumph that will captivate you like a bard's ballad. The game continues the saga of Chell and GLaDOS, the AI with a knack for dark humor and the occasional compliment. GLaDOS's snarky remarks are as sharp as a ninja's shuriken, and her wit will keep you entertained like a comedic duo on stage.  The game introduces new characters like Wheatley, a bumbling personality core with a penchant for bumbling and hilarious British charm. Wheatley's antics add a layer of levity to the experience, like adding sprinkles to an already delightful cupcake.  The narrative unfolds like a captivating novel, keeping you hooked from start to finish like a fish on a line. You'll find yourself emotionally invested in the fate of Chell and the Aperture Science facility, even as you laugh at GLaDOS's passive-aggressive remarks.  Cooperative Multiplayer: Ah, but Portal 2's delights don't end there. The game boasts a cooperative multiplayer mode that's as delightful as having a partner in crime. Working together with a friend (or perhaps a friendly rival) to solve intricate puzzles and communicate through in-game gestures is as charming as watching a synchronized dance routine.  The cooperative puzzles require seamless teamwork and communication, which can lead to hilarious moments of miscommunication and botched portal placements. But remember, in the world of Portal 2, even the most disastrous mistakes can end in peals of laughter.  Graphics and Sound: Portal 2's visual design is as polished as a shiny new Aperture Science test chamber. The environments are a testament to the game's attention to detail, from the decaying ruins of the facility to the pristine test chambers that beckon you like a magician's invitation.  The sound design is equally impressive, with a captivating soundtrack that complements the gameplay like a well-timed drumbeat. The voice acting, particularly the performances of GLaDOS and Wheatley, is nothing short of stellar, deserving accolades like a standing ovation.  Challenging and Rewarding: Portal 2 isn't afraid to challenge your intellect like a sparring match with a grandmaster. But fear not, for the game is as rewarding as a treasure chest filled with rare loot. Each puzzle you conquer feels like an intellectual victory, and the moments of revelation are as delightful as unwrapping a long-awaited gift.  Conclusion: In conclusion, Portal 2 is a sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it in every way like a magician pulling off an awe-inspiring illusion. Its puzzles will twist your mind like a pretzel, and its humor will leave you in stitches like a comedy show.  So, if you're ready to embark on an adventure that's as intellectually stimulating as it is hilarious, enter the world of Portal 2. Whether you're a returning fan of the series or a newcomer to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, prepare to be captivated by the wit, charmed by the characters, and enthralled by the puzzles.  Grab your portal gun, put on your thinking cap, and get ready for a mind-warping, side-splitting experience. Portal 2 is more than just a sequel; it's a comedic masterpiece of puzzle-solving, storytelling, and unforgettable moments. Now, let's open those portals and step through to a world of laughter and brain-teasing delight!"
57536665,english,1,620,"Great coop puzzle game that in a short time span will make you feel dumb as rocks and smarter than Einstein. My wife and I strengthened our marriage bond through this teamwork game and luckily, we were pretty much even as far as figuring stuff out. ;)"
1110736,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun. At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact. The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well. One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay. Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player. I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter.  Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.

78206593,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a phenomenal game by Valve and a true successor to its first one. Not my first time playing this, I've played this before Steam like 4 times and now this completing it in 6 hours is kinda short, looking forward to trying the co-op. Such an amazing story, visuals, gameplay, everything on par especially the design of the gigantic structures just like how in Half-Life there's Black Mesa. Not to forget about the voice acting, in general, is ""the cherry on top"", IMO J.K Simmons nailed it voicing ""Cave Johnson"" making me imagine how his facial expression was every time he talks. I wish if there is a new Portal game in the works or going to be, who knows. Overall, Highly recommended, every gamer or a newcomer should play this. 10/10"
32285117,english,1,620,"DAMN this game is good. I think at this point everyone knows what the Portal series is, so I'll just point out some of the highlights. The story is great with interesting characters and a perfect pace. The plot twists are well done and it only tells you what you need to know. The story is also supplemented by the great humor. Of course it's a puzzle game, so the puzzles and level design need to be good. Luckily, they're done flawlessly. On top of that the environments are also amazing and add lots to the world. Once you're done with the story mode there's a level creator that is perfectly made and allows you to do just about anything you want. People have used this to make some crazy and amazing levels. The community, while I'm not sure how active it is now, has always been very helpful and creative. You'll never run out of content as long as talented map creators exist. Definitely a must play for anyone. It's only $20 and worth every penny."

It's not easy to follow up to a groundbreaking game like Portal, but this sequel is really something special."
10527581,english,1,620,"Portal was sort of a little experiment of a huge company. That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.  　STILL ALIVE?  　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.  　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER  　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.  　ENDLESS TESTS  　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.  　Multiplayer: 　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ  　　Co-op:    ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Storyline:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Graphics:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺  　  　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.  　　　　[i]VALVe made another good 　　game. With good intelligent humor, 　　charismatic characters and unusual 　　interesting gameplay.  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　As expected, nine out of ten [9/10]."

114069283,english,1,620,there is no describable feeling for the pang of sadness I get whenever I replay a Valve game knowing they will never put their all into a game ever again. Alyx is nice but the earlier half-life games and portal were something special.
49246649,english,1,620,"I cannot believe it took me this long to write a review about this game. I wrote an essay about how good it is for an English class before I wrote a review talking about how good it is.  Long overdue, I honestly don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece. This game is hands down the best one I have ever played in my life. An improvement on the first one in all the right ways, this game is potentially the only singleplayer experience I have had a proper craving for, the only experience that I have genuinely felt that going back and replaying is the thing I want to be doing.  In the essay that I wrote about Portal 2, I spoke at length about all of the fancy rhetoric that the game employs to convey various emotions and force the player into a mindset. The big thing I noticed was how well the game uses the physically small map to portray this MASSIVE sense of scale. In the essay I focused more on how it forces the player into experiencing something akin to a ""trapped freedom"", where you have the opportunity to do whatever you want but in a certain space. In retrospect, I should simply have written about the way that the game conveys lonely companionship, fearful trust, and reliance on someone openly trying to kill you. It tears out your deepest emotions and plays with them, trying to and succeeding in making you feel two conflicting emotions simultaneously. This is a powerful way to write a story and Portal 2 pulls it off flawlessly.  With a mix of top-tier voice acting, fluid animation, realistic interactions, interesting characters, an amazing story, the usage of a silent protagonist, and the lack of cutscenes entirely, the game feels realistic and involved. The game doesn't break immersion for a second. While remaining tense, it manages to employ humour, and does everything tastefully.  I can't rave about everything in one review because it frankly will turn into another 20 page essay like the last one did. The TL;DR of this is that the game does everything a game should do flawlessly.   This is the best game ever made and nothing can change my mind."

What really shines here though is the fantastic voice acting from the antagonists, Wheatley is hilarious with his british accent and GLaDOS just being cynical and awesome as always! It has a lot more challenges as well and the multiplayer works perfectly.   The game is a masterpiece indeed!"

187593044,english,1,620,"Rating: 10/10  Developed by Valve and released in 2011, Portal 2 is a masterpiece of puzzle-platforming, featuring brilliant level design, sharp humor, and one of the most memorable narratives in gaming. Expanding on the mechanics of the original Portal (2007), this sequel introduces new puzzle elements, a longer and richer story, and an incredibly fun co-op mode. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys brain-teasing challenges and witty writing.  Why Portal 2 is a Masterpiece 🧩 Brilliant Puzzle Mechanics The core of Portal 2’s gameplay remains the portal gun, allowing players to create two connected portals to navigate through puzzles. However, this sequel introduces new elements like:  Excursion Funnels (tractor beams that carry objects and players) Repulsion Gel (bouncy surfaces for high jumps) Propulsion Gel (speed-enhancing surfaces) Light Bridges and Aerial Faith Plates Each of these elements adds depth and variety, keeping puzzles fresh throughout the campaign.  🎭 Incredible Writing and Humor Portal 2’s dialogue is legendary. The writing team, led by Erik Wolpaw, delivers some of the funniest and smartest lines in gaming history. GLaDOS, the sarcastic AI antagonist, returns with passive-aggressive insults and dark humor, while Wheatley, voiced by Stephen Merchant, provides an energetic and often hilarious presence. The game’s humor is perfectly balanced, making it both funny and deeply engaging.  🏢 Expanded World-Building Unlike the first game, which mostly took place in sterile test chambers, Portal 2 explores the history of Aperture Science. Players venture into old, decayed sections of the facility, uncovering audio logs of Cave Johnson, the eccentric founder of Aperture. This deeper lore makes the world feel more alive and mysterious.  🤝 Co-op Mode – A Perfect Two-Player Experience Portal 2 features a fully-fledged cooperative mode, where two players control Atlas and P-Body, two testing robots. Co-op puzzles require teamwork, timing, and communication, making it one of the best cooperative experiences in gaming. It’s brilliantly designed, ensuring both players feel equally involved in solving the challenges.  🎶 Memorable Soundtrack Portal 2’s soundtrack, composed by Mike Morasky, features dynamic music that adapts to player actions. The game also ends with another hilarious song from GLaDOS, ""Want You Gone"", following up on the iconic ""Still Alive"" from the first game.  Are There Any Flaws? ❌ Some Puzzles May Feel Too Easy for Veterans Compared to the original Portal, some experienced puzzle-solvers might find Portal 2’s difficulty a bit more forgiving. However, the co-op mode and community-created test chambers provide plenty of challenging content.  ❌ No Portal 3... Yet The biggest flaw? Valve never made a Portal 3. 😢  Conclusion Portal 2 is a masterpiece that balances clever puzzle design, fantastic humor, and deep world-building into an unforgettable experience. Whether you're playing solo or with a friend, the game delivers one of the most rewarding and entertaining adventures ever made. It remains one of Valve’s greatest achievements and is highly recommended for any gamer.  🔹 Rating: 10/10 – Brilliant puzzles, unforgettable characters, and one of the best co-op experiences in gaming."
135872966,english,1,620,Portal2 is on my list of favorite games that I like to go back and revisit every year or so. I have yet to play a game that has impressed me as much as Portal2. Some come close but the engaging puzzles and intriguing story are hard to beat. I really hope they make a true Portal3 or Half-Life/Portal crossover and continue the story.  *side note: I originally played this on a console but find it's much easier to play advanced levels with a mouse and keyboard.
186970926,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.  One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.  Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.  Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.  Overall, Portal"

Portal 2 definitely live up to what people say about it, the game is Overwhelming and have the right to be considered [b] One of the Best Puzzle Games [/b] created to date, it is really a Must play for PC Gaming, even if you are not into Puzzle games like myself... I will talk about the most striking things for me during my playtime and some thoughts about it.  [list]   [*]  [u] [b] Storyline [/b] [/u] – The Story has improved a lot since the first game, there is now a more noticeable narrative, between the Old Villain (Glados), a new character (Whitley) and the playable character (Chell). There is also a lot from the Origin of the Aperture Science, making it an interesting and solid game to go through.  [*]  [u] [b] Challenging and Mechanics [/b] [/u] – The game has a base mechanic, the Portal Gun, a weapon that shoot 2 different portals that you can go through… It might be simple, but the game keeps giving you new things to work with along the chapters, making it a lot more Challenging as you go further in the game.  [*]  [u] [b] Comedy [/b] [/u] – This game is Hilarious, not only from the well written jokes spoken by  the characters, but the environment has some hidden details that are so funny as well, I would definitely recommend you to read the plaques and frames around the map.  [*]  [u] [b] Aged like Wine [/b] [/u] – Portal 2 was released in April of 2011, back then it was revolutionary, it was a brand new game with new features and mechanics, today, it is not much different, the Graphics is fairly decent and the game still unique. The best thing is that Portal 2 is a lot cheaper than it once was.  [*]  [u] [b] Co-op [/b] [/u] – As Atlas and P-Body, you can play this mode with one more friend and enjoy a variety of more Levels, now with 4 different Portals to work with, which makes the Levels much more complex. The Co-op mode not only uses the already introduced mechanics very well, but it also gives a little touch to the main Story.  [/list]  When I think about it, makes me really impressed that this game was released more than 9 years ago, and it still a [b] Unique [/b] and [b] Original [/b] puzzle game. Portal 2 is a much-improved version from Portal 1, a game that was already great, but this one is a refined version and brought the potential it had… And I must praise the [b] Voice Acting [/b], one of the best features and contribute a lot for it being so Iconic.  Is understandable why people are always memeing and asking for Valve to make more games of every franchise they have; the quality of their games is top notch… Maybe their secret is that they took a long time to develop, from the idea to the playability… We just have to keep waiting.

Now, imagine all of those unanswered questions and obscure mysteries that linger within the first game, and how this sequel answers nearly all those said questions with the utmost scientific explanations through the lines of entertainment from this one.

Play through portal 1 for its ingenious design and then play through portal 2 for it's additions as well as the comedy. After 10 years or so of owning the game, i picked up speedrunning.

24334460,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in April 2011. Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.  Portal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.  The dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.  The co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.  [h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1] Portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it.   Rating: 8.5/10  [h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1] 	- The simple story that ends with an excellent climax. 	- Excellent voice acting. 	- Very good dialogue.  	- The challenging and increasingly complex puzzles. 	- Length.  [h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1] 	- Annoying glitches with the R feedback prompt in single player and frequent crashes via alt tabbing. 	 If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

132015510,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a highly acclaimed puzzle game in which players must solve complex puzzles to progress through various levels.

Pros: Great gameplay: Portal 2 offers intricate puzzles that require strategic and logical thinking, making the game highly satisfying. Excellent storyline: The game's story is very engaging and full of unexpected twists. Excellent game mechanics: The game introduces new elements such as gels, which add additional layers of complexity to the puzzles. Great humor: Players can expect many funny situations and jokes that add another dimension to the game. Cons: May be challenging for beginners: The game can be difficult for those who are not accustomed to puzzle games requiring strategic thinking. May be short for some players: The game may be slightly shorter than other games of its kind, which may disappoint some players. Overall, Portal 2 is a great puzzle game that offers excellent gameplay, a great storyline, and excellent game mechanics. Although it may be challenging for beginners and slightly shorter than other games of its kind, it is definitely worth considering for fans of puzzle games."
67688868,english,1,620,"[h1]Great game[/h1]  Portal 2 is a continuation of a very good first part. The game is based on the same mechanisms as the first part, and adds elements that make the game better.  I'm mainly talking about cooperation mode. It's done so well that I think it's more interesting than the single player mode and more fun to play. Of course the storyline is very good, but the ability to solve puzzles with a friend appeals to me more. The boards are made in such a way that we are unlikely to finish them by ourselves and the cooperation is very important here.  Of course, our main object that we need to complete the game is the gun portal, just like in the previous part. It does not introduce any innovations, it works on the same principle as before, that is, it can create two portals between which we can move.  We need to mention the riddles that await us during the game. We will come across simple, trivial puzzles, which will take us literally a while to solve, but we will also find some that we will have to spend more time on. This discrepancy makes the game more diverse and friendly even for younger players.  The graphics are very good for the year of the game release. The locations are nice, they contain various details, despite the old engine, the graphics can really make an amazing impression.  [h1]Summary[/h1]  Portal 2 is definitely one of the best games I've played. It's hard to find any mistakes, the game is just great. We have an interesting storyline, good cooperation mode, easy and difficult puzzles. All in all, the only thing I can attach to is a few bugs, but they are so few that they do not affect the pleasure of the game.

38663794,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece. The voice acting is some of the best that I've ever heard, the puzzles are just hard enough, the game runs beautifully. It is just enjoyable if you look at the single player. If you've considered buying this game and haven't yet, do it! The only bad part about this game is that, now that I'm finished with it, I can never experience it for the first time again.  Next Target - Co-Op Campaign"
137189353,english,1,620,"One of the best games I've ever played. Amazing mechanics, awsome  story and great graphics. Congrats to the developers. 10/10. This need a sequel 100%."
35453186,english,1,620,"'Portal 2' may just be the most enjoyable single-player game I have ever played - and I will provide you with five reasons why!  - Firstly, the dialogue is brilliant; - The story is surprisingly engaging, and your 'companion', Wheatley, is highly entertaining, although perhaps a little too talkative for some;  - The atmosphere is highly immersive, with a variety of settings ranging from - without spoiling too much - underground to laboratories to factories; - Very rewarding puzzles that challenge you without becoming monotonous or frustrating. This is entirely subjective, though, so some of you may dissent from this view; and - The co-op mode provides more content to enjoy with a friend. Truth be told, I found this mode to be more enjoyable than the single-player! And to that end, the prospect of replaying the co-op mode is certainly appealing IF you are fortunate enough to a) have more than 1 friend who owns the game, and b) own more than one friend.   11/10 GET THE GAME!"
76774117,english,1,620,"Another 𝘤𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘤 game you have to try at least once. Great puzzles that will make you feel like the smartest person on the world, while also maintaining a good storyline with just fantastic characters. I have to say that I think the voice acting is one of the best features of the game, they certainly help make every character be more memorable. Purely because of the voice acting, I can remember what every character's attitude was like despite that it has been 𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘴 since I first played! The campaign and story might be a tad short and some maps might look a bit repetitive, but I personally don't think those are a huge con. Everything else about the game gives shines brighter than a couple small faults. Even after the campaign, you can try out coop or many of the workshop maps! You can continue the magic after the victory from the finale, and there are some 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 creative maps out there. Invite your friend to play and it'll definitely feel like a smart bonding session you should enjoy. Overall, I think this is a great game suited for every type of gamer and I definitely enjoyed it."
110963638,english,1,620,"Where do I even start? First of all the story is awesome and can be replayed so much without loosing its value. The puzzles are difficult but not too difficult to make it infuriating, once you finish a really hard puzzle you feel so much accomplishment. The co-op is one of the best co-op games I have ever played, it has a great story and actually feels like its meant to be a part of the game instead of just some afterthought. There are community made maps for single player and co-op, there are so many well made community maps that feel like they were produced by a game studio. You can even make your own map if you wanted to. SOOO many easter eggs and secrets in this game its unreal. There are barely any glitches that you can just run into during game play. Even the title screen changes depending on where you are in the game. The community for this game is insane. Speedrunning this game is insane, if you somehow feel like you are getting bored of this game, then try speedrunning it. This is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. Oh and i forgot to mention... THE CUSTOM MODS FOR THIS GAME IS INSANE!!!! If you have this game you should really consider downloading the mods for this game, some even just straight up make a whole new game with new mechanics and a whole story with new characters and its just the coolest thing ever, examples are: Portal Stories Mel, Portal Reloaded and Aperture Tag just to name a tiny amount of them. This game is perhaps one of, if not my most favourite game of all time.   TL;DR : Portal 2 is good game, lots to do, 10/10"

It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.  In the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.  After that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.  And to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game.  It is a gift that just keeps on giving.  With the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, [b]Portal 2[/b] rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games.  It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence.  If you haven’t yet tried it, now is the time.  There are hours of entertainment waiting for you.

64219641,english,1,620,"Amazing game. Truly defines the puzzle genre, while acting as a great sequel to portal. Read the end for a TL:DR.  Campaign is flawless. It offers a more in-depth journey through aperture that the first game could never accomplish with the original source engine. Campaign characters: Lovable, Exciting, and not annoying. One thing that games forget to do is make their characters good. This game does that in just the right way that it feels like you've built a connection to the characters. Puzzles are easy once you've mastered them, (as I have) but harder once you first play through the game.  Co-op: Amazing. Taking place after the events of the singleplayer campaign, you and your friend (maybe someone who's played the campaign before), can have a really fun time playing. Level editor: Easy and fun to use. I really enjoy building levels for this game, and it shows based on how many I've made. You can also use the hammer editor to build more in-depth and custom levels, but if you are new to level design and want something simple to start you out, this game is for you.  Community levels: Sometimes fun, sometimes boring. You never really know what you're going to get with a level from the workshop. It could be either be a masterpiece made with the hammer editor, or a test chamber made by a 5 year old who thought walking to the exit without having a puzzle was hard. There are also co-op community levels that can yet again be played with your buddy! If you and your partner had a really fun time playing, then you'll probably enjoy working together to beat community levels. Of course you still never know what you're gonna get.  Community mods or 6 part levels: These just add more game that you would want to replay. There are some really good standalone free mods on the steam shop right now if you want to pick them up. Some really good steam mods: Portal stories: Mel, Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Inititive, Thinking with Time Machine. Here is a list of some 6-part levels that I would personally recommend: Wheatley's Unscientific Tests, Minecraft in Portal 2, COSMOGNY and many more.  Only bad point in this game: There are co-op cosmetics that are not required but still act as in-app purchases if you are so inclined to buy them. The entire store is only about 10 dollars which kinda balances it out though.  TL:DR: Campaign is really good. Co-op is really fun. Level editor is a excellent introduction to level design. Community levels you really don't know what you're gonna get. (Played 6 hours of custom levels today and I wanted to die at the end) Includes Co-op community levels so you and your partner can want to die together. (Sarcasm)  FINAL REVIEW: Finally, right? 8/10 Valve, you've knocked it out of the park once again. Hopefully Half life: Alyx will bring us the same experience.  MODERN EDIT: lemme add to this essay a bit, first of all, i first saw this game in the window of a gamestop, on one of those big posters around the time when it came out (i was small and unable to play video games) i really liked the co-op robots, so a while later i finally played it, and ever since i played portal 1, (not so much portal 2) i've absolutely fallen in love with the source engine, so this franchise singlehandedly changed my life in an absolutely insane way, i am now going to go to college for computer engineering and will attempt to get a job at valve (will update if that happens)"

71607900,english,1,620,"[h1] Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to science[/h1]  Portal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to [b]T2: Judgement Day[/b] when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.  [h1]Pros[/h1] +The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot.  +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done.  +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this.  +[b]Stephen Merchant[/b] and [b]J.K Simmons[/b] did an absolutely terrific job. [b]Ellen McLain’s[/b] performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D +Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original! +Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times.  +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game.  +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by [b]Mike Morasky[/b] and [b]The National[/b].  +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend.  +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story.  +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo.  +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support. +Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free. +Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed.  +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support.  +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line.   [h1]Cons[/h1]  -First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV. -Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes.  -Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.    [h1]The Bottom Line[/h1] Portal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson; perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.  The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer.   Highly recommend it to……[b]everyone[/b].

128382605,english,1,620,"Timeless masterpiece. A textbook example of how a video game should be. Splendid pacing, narrative always flows without major interruptions and the player is always in the action. Superb voice acting (JK Simmons, Ellen McLain, Nolan North) that brings characters to life. A great framework of story that leaves player with lots of answered AND unanswered questions. And it is simply fun.  I wish Valve kept making such great games. They truly understood what players wanted. They still do. Only difference is that they do not ACT on it."

14590312,english,1,620,"I have no idea why I waited so long to review this game. Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up. If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them! ------------------------------- [b]Intro[/b] You know how when you are on vacation and say, ""I am so glad it isn't winter right now.""? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about. ------------------------------- [b]Summary:[/b] This game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programmed-to-be ""idiot"" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play.  ------------------------------- [b]Multi-Player[/b] Then there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totally worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/load-outs into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/mental abilities. ------------------------------- [b]Other important things[/b] The many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the story-line, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.  To dumb it down: ------------------------------- [u][b]Pros[/b][/u] +Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful game-play.  +Wonderful audio and music for a great experience.  +Well-designed maps and challenges.  +Unlimited maps (user-created).  +Fantastic story-line.  +Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials).  +Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable. +Gender neutral. [u][b]++Helps with cognitive brain activity[/b][/u]. ------------------------------- [u][b]Cons[/b][/u] -Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1).  -Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here [spoiler]to me[/spoiler].) -Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.)  -Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.) ------------------------------- [b]My opinionated review[/b] I would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves. ------------------------------- [b]Rating[/b] Out of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing ""Portal transportation"" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definitely get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a [spoiler]97/100[/spoiler] after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating. ------------------------------- [b]Finally[/b] Thanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it! ~thedubmark (I write reviews now :))"
124813542,english,1,620,"An amazing sequel, not only does it keep the atmosphere of the first one, but also upgrades everything, mechanics, graphics, its longer and the story is just great, new characters that add so much more to the universe. Characters that you will never forget.  New puzzles of course that will challenge you and feel satisfying to complete. A beautiful ending and conclusion to Chell's story. It definitely will leave with a desire for more, that you can fulfill with the co-op mode or the myriad of chambers the community has been uploading over the years.  Just get it as soon as you can, and make sure you play Portal 1 first so you can enjoy 2 the most."

61960334,english,1,620,"Posted: April 17, 2011  The highest rated game on Steam, the best puzzle game ever fathomed, the 2nd best game ever created, and #1 worst dev moderation in history.   A game with limitless potential, with a limited ability to reach it.  A game with so much nostalgia, that it's players become forever stuck in 2011.  A game with such good comedy, that people mistake it for a sitcom instead of a puzzle game.  A puzzle game whose players don't like solving puzzles.  A game full of paradoxes (literally).  A game full of sarcasm. ;)  Really and truly, there is no other game like Portal 2 in existence, because there has never been another game that comes close to Portal 2's sheer amount of wasted potential. If only Valve would add a level editor and workshop, people would be able to play free, high quality puzzles indefinitely and never have to buy another game in their life. With the community in charge of creating content, there would be THOUSANDS of new maps for people to play and test their brains with every week! If I were to make predictions, this level editor should contain:  1. All Portal 2 test elements (including reflection gel and sendificators).  2. All the extra, Valve-made fizzler variants (not used in the main campaign for some odd reason).  3. All test elements from Portal 1, including cube deflectors, flux fields, positron orbs, and lifeform sensors.  4. The ability to choose between Portal 2's aesthetic styles (maybe even Portal 1), with matching element variants.  5. The ability to add custom background music from either game (I especially love ""Halted Production"" and ""Sin"").  6. An easy, resizable grid system for more complex and puzzle-relevant architecture.  7. An efficient brush compiler with optimized entity instances.  8. The ability to add custom music and screenshots.  9. Other cool and unique options for different test elements.  It's amazing how VALVe came up with all these cool new ideas; thank you so much for all your work! We can't wait to participate in all the future mapping competitions you'll hold! As for workshop integration, the only problem I foresee is people posting unsolvable puzzles on it. But if they just add a mechanic like Mario Maker where you have to beat your own level before publishing it, that should fix the issue. Oh wait, you say Mario Maker won't be released until 2015, and I just violated our NDA (no dissenters allowed) contract? Welp, guess I better change my identity and make a new account. See you in court, mate."

I immediately wanted to continue playing,  I was hooked from that point forward. Played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 FPS average. It was worth every second of it, honestly.   The campaign is, of course, one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming. The difficulty curve is well-done, the humor is always well-executed and there's tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens. Then, of course, the co-op is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and, of course, another person to cooperate with. I have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike, especially the moments where you have to decide if you REALLY want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partner's relying on. And, to top it all off, there's a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least time/portals with your friends. To this day I occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobody's beaten them, and it's always a pleasant surprise when someone has.  All in all, the game's simply amazing. If the fact that it's the #1 rated game on Steam with 121,015 Positive reviews to 1,586 Negative doesn't indicate its sheer quality, I don't know what will. It's a great game that came from a time when Valve still made them, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart."

The levels are very well designed, the characters are memorable, the dialogues are humourous, the puzzles can get confusing at times but not impossible to solve, multiplayer is a lot of fun and the story is great especially GLaDOS and Chell's relationship. I absolutely love this game.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVVZaZ8yO6o"
134376735,english,1,620,"I bought this with my partner to play co-op together, and I think I speak for both of us when I say we enjoyed this game very much. We did the mistake of doing the extra *optional* difficult missions right away before doing the main story due to our lack of reading skills, which made things harder than necessary since we sort of skipped the tutorial, but it was a fun but challenging experience nonetheless. We have yet to finish the main co-op or the singleplayer missions, but I would like to praise the game regardless because it truly is a fun game to play where you have to use your brain a little, and when playing co-op you have to work together which was an overall very positive experience.  I will update my review after completing the game if it somehow changes my mind, but for 90% off on sale (cost ~ $1 USD) this game is an absolute steal and I cannot recommend it enough if you grab it while discounted. The game may be old, but the graphics hold up pretty good I would say."

177402372,english,1,620,Hilarious dialogue. Deep lore. Difficult puzzle experience. These things make this game and it's prequel my favorite video games I've played. Only complaint is there's not a third game.
28688378,english,1,620,"Honestly I'm still baffled and I'm clueless how to start this review. I'm still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel. I can't wait to jump into the co-op function honestly since the singleplayer was this good.  Valve literally took a look at Portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel. They added new general features like a loading screen, which I didn't find mandatory, and you can see where your portals are placed through walls. They stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map. Speaking of puzzles, they added so many, that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel. They added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want.  You have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land. You have bridges to guide you around the map. You also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button. Finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white. Red gel gives you a speed boost. Blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it, mainly for places that you couldn't portal on before.  Obviously the things previously said aren't the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment. The story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences. It also contains a few plot twists here and there. The places you visit are fairly new but you'll visit some well remembered places from portal. Something they also introduced is companions, the most part of the game you'll have a object travelling with you. One of them is a funny little core with a british accent. Aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths. The jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh.  I highly recommend  that you buy this game, and play it for the rest of the day or week. Turn off your notification, because the game doesn't support tabbing, and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story. (Edit:) You also can choose from many maps from the community to test out so you won't get tired of the story and you can still play."
171628798,english,1,620,"God, it's amazing how well this game holds up even after more than a decade. Both the singleplayer and co-op experiences are top tier in their own way. The voice acting is simply spectacular, the story is intriguing and the puzzles get progressively harder throughout the game (thus providing you with a nice learning curve). This sequel overall is a great step up from the first game and a must-have for virtually any gamer I'd say."
124756887,english,1,620,"One of the greatest games of all time. Your life will be changed, having played it. The writing is hilarious, the story is heart warming and triumphant. The characters are the life of the party. Throw in challenging physics puzzles, witty banter, and the constant threat of doom makes for a story and gameplay that you'll remember for years. The comments and banter get even more meta if the you've played the first one."
142783653,english,1,620,"Prepare yourselves for a sequel that's as witty as a stand-up comedy routine and as mind-bending as a Rubik's cube on steroids. Portal 2, the brainchild of Valve, is a masterclass in puzzle-solving, humor, and creativity that will leave you scratching your head and clutching your sides in laughter. So, let's dive into this Portal to discover why it's more than just a cake-filled lie.  Gameplay and Puzzles: Portal 2 picks up where its predecessor left off, throwing you back into the test chambers of Aperture Science like an unwilling lab rat. Armed with the iconic portal gun, you'll face an array of puzzles that will have you pondering like a philosopher in a think tank.  The puzzles in Portal 2 are as varied as a box of assorted chocolates. From ingenious tests of spatial reasoning to brain-bending platforming challenges, the game keeps you on your toes like a ballet dancer auditioning for a circus. It's like an exhilarating dance of portals, where each move is as precise as a surgeon's scalpel.  But fear not; if you ever find yourself stuck like a fly in honey, the solution is often simpler than a toddler's toy. The ""Aha!"" moments you experience after finally cracking a puzzle are as satisfying as pulling off a magic trick that leaves your audience in awe.  Narrative and Humor: Beyond the puzzles, Portal 2 is a storytelling triumph that will captivate you like a bard's ballad. The game continues the saga of Chell and GLaDOS, the AI with a knack for dark humor and the occasional compliment. GLaDOS's snarky remarks are as sharp as a ninja's shuriken, and her wit will keep you entertained like a comedic duo on stage.  The game introduces new characters like Wheatley, a bumbling personality core with a penchant for bumbling and hilarious British charm. Wheatley's antics add a layer of levity to the experience, like adding sprinkles to an already delightful cupcake.  The narrative unfolds like a captivating novel, keeping you hooked from start to finish like a fish on a line. You'll find yourself emotionally invested in the fate of Chell and the Aperture Science facility, even as you laugh at GLaDOS's passive-aggressive remarks.  Cooperative Multiplayer: Ah, but Portal 2's delights don't end there. The game boasts a cooperative multiplayer mode that's as delightful as having a partner in crime. Working together with a friend (or perhaps a friendly rival) to solve intricate puzzles and communicate through in-game gestures is as charming as watching a synchronized dance routine.  The cooperative puzzles require seamless teamwork and communication, which can lead to hilarious moments of miscommunication and botched portal placements. But remember, in the world of Portal 2, even the most disastrous mistakes can end in peals of laughter.  Graphics and Sound: Portal 2's visual design is as polished as a shiny new Aperture Science test chamber. The environments are a testament to the game's attention to detail, from the decaying ruins of the facility to the pristine test chambers that beckon you like a magician's invitation.  The sound design is equally impressive, with a captivating soundtrack that complements the gameplay like a well-timed drumbeat. The voice acting, particularly the performances of GLaDOS and Wheatley, is nothing short of stellar, deserving accolades like a standing ovation.  Challenging and Rewarding: Portal 2 isn't afraid to challenge your intellect like a sparring match with a grandmaster. But fear not, for the game is as rewarding as a treasure chest filled with rare loot. Each puzzle you conquer feels like an intellectual victory, and the moments of revelation are as delightful as unwrapping a long-awaited gift.  Conclusion: In conclusion, Portal 2 is a sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it in every way like a magician pulling off an awe-inspiring illusion. Its puzzles will twist your mind like a pretzel, and its humor will leave you in stitches like a comedy show.  So, if you're ready to embark on an adventure that's as intellectually stimulating as it is hilarious, enter the world of Portal 2. Whether you're a returning fan of the series or a newcomer to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, prepare to be captivated by the wit, charmed by the characters, and enthralled by the puzzles.  Grab your portal gun, put on your thinking cap, and get ready for a mind-warping, side-splitting experience. Portal 2 is more than just a sequel; it's a comedic masterpiece of puzzle-solving, storytelling, and unforgettable moments. Now, let's open those portals and step through to a world of laughter and brain-teasing delight!"

1110736,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun. At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact. The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well. One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay. Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player. I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter.  Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.

78206593,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a phenomenal game by Valve and a true successor to its first one. Not my first time playing this, I've played this before Steam like 4 times and now this completing it in 6 hours is kinda short, looking forward to trying the co-op. Such an amazing story, visuals, gameplay, everything on par especially the design of the gigantic structures just like how in Half-Life there's Black Mesa. Not to forget about the voice acting, in general, is ""the cherry on top"", IMO J.K Simmons nailed it voicing ""Cave Johnson"" making me imagine how his facial expression was every time he talks. I wish if there is a new Portal game in the works or going to be, who knows. Overall, Highly recommended, every gamer or a newcomer should play this. 10/10"
32285117,english,1,620,"DAMN this game is good. I think at this point everyone knows what the Portal series is, so I'll just point out some of the highlights. The story is great with interesting characters and a perfect pace. The plot twists are well done and it only tells you what you need to know. The story is also supplemented by the great humor. Of course it's a puzzle game, so the puzzles and level design need to be good. Luckily, they're done flawlessly. On top of that the environments are also amazing and add lots to the world. Once you're done with the story mode there's a level creator that is perfectly made and allows you to do just about anything you want. People have used this to make some crazy and amazing levels. The community, while I'm not sure how active it is now, has always been very helpful and creative. You'll never run out of content as long as talented map creators exist. Definitely a must play for anyone. It's only $20 and worth every penny."

10527581,english,1,620,"Portal was sort of a little experiment of a huge company. That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.  　STILL ALIVE?  　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.  　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER  　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.  　ENDLESS TESTS  　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.  　Multiplayer: 　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ  　　Co-op:    ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Storyline:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Graphics:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺  　  　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.  　　　　[i]VALVe made another good 　　game. With good intelligent humor, 　　charismatic characters and unusual 　　interesting gameplay.  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　As expected, nine out of ten [9/10]."

49246649,english,1,620,"I cannot believe it took me this long to write a review about this game. I wrote an essay about how good it is for an English class before I wrote a review talking about how good it is.  Long overdue, I honestly don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece. This game is hands down the best one I have ever played in my life. An improvement on the first one in all the right ways, this game is potentially the only singleplayer experience I have had a proper craving for, the only experience that I have genuinely felt that going back and replaying is the thing I want to be doing.  In the essay that I wrote about Portal 2, I spoke at length about all of the fancy rhetoric that the game employs to convey various emotions and force the player into a mindset. The big thing I noticed was how well the game uses the physically small map to portray this MASSIVE sense of scale. In the essay I focused more on how it forces the player into experiencing something akin to a ""trapped freedom"", where you have the opportunity to do whatever you want but in a certain space. In retrospect, I should simply have written about the way that the game conveys lonely companionship, fearful trust, and reliance on someone openly trying to kill you. It tears out your deepest emotions and plays with them, trying to and succeeding in making you feel two conflicting emotions simultaneously. This is a powerful way to write a story and Portal 2 pulls it off flawlessly.  With a mix of top-tier voice acting, fluid animation, realistic interactions, interesting characters, an amazing story, the usage of a silent protagonist, and the lack of cutscenes entirely, the game feels realistic and involved. The game doesn't break immersion for a second. While remaining tense, it manages to employ humour, and does everything tastefully.  I can't rave about everything in one review because it frankly will turn into another 20 page essay like the last one did. The TL;DR of this is that the game does everything a game should do flawlessly.   This is the best game ever made and nothing can change my mind."

However, this sequel introduces new elements like:  Excursion Funnels (tractor beams that carry objects and players) Repulsion Gel (bouncy surfaces for high jumps) Propulsion Gel (speed-enhancing surfaces) Light Bridges and Aerial Faith Plates Each of these elements adds depth and variety, keeping puzzles fresh throughout the campaign.  🎭 Incredible Writing and Humor Portal 2’s dialogue is legendary. The writing team, led by Erik Wolpaw, delivers some of the funniest and smartest lines in gaming history. GLaDOS, the sarcastic AI antagonist, returns with passive-aggressive insults and dark humor, while Wheatley, voiced by Stephen Merchant, provides an energetic and often hilarious presence. The game’s humor is perfectly balanced, making it both funny and deeply engaging.  🏢 Expanded World-Building Unlike the first game, which mostly took place in sterile test chambers, Portal 2 explores the history of Aperture Science. Players venture into old, decayed sections of the facility, uncovering audio logs of Cave Johnson, the eccentric founder of Aperture. This deeper lore makes the world feel more alive and mysterious.  🤝 Co-op Mode – A Perfect Two-Player Experience Portal 2 features a fully-fledged cooperative mode, where two players control Atlas and P-Body, two testing robots. Co-op puzzles require teamwork, timing, and communication, making it one of the best cooperative experiences in gaming. It’s brilliantly designed, ensuring both players feel equally involved in solving the challenges.  🎶 Memorable Soundtrack Portal 2’s soundtrack, composed by Mike Morasky, features dynamic music that adapts to player actions. The game also ends with another hilarious song from GLaDOS, ""Want You Gone"", following up on the iconic ""Still Alive"" from the first game.  Are There Any Flaws? ❌ Some Puzzles May Feel Too Easy for Veterans Compared to the original Portal, some experienced puzzle-solvers might find Portal 2’s difficulty a bit more forgiving. However, the co-op mode and community-created test chambers provide plenty of challenging content.  ❌ No Portal 3... Yet The biggest flaw? Valve never made a Portal 3. 😢  Conclusion Portal 2 is a masterpiece that balances clever puzzle design, fantastic humor, and deep world-building into an unforgettable experience. Whether you're playing solo or with a friend, the game delivers one of the most rewarding and entertaining adventures ever made. It remains one of Valve’s greatest achievements and is highly recommended for any gamer.  🔹 Rating: 10/10 – Brilliant puzzles, unforgettable characters, and one of the best co-op experiences in gaming."
135872966,english,1,620,Portal2 is on my list of favorite games that I like to go back and revisit every year or so. I have yet to play a game that has impressed me as much as Portal2. Some come close but the engaging puzzles and intriguing story are hard to beat. I really hope they make a true Portal3 or Half-Life/Portal crossover and continue the story.  *side note: I originally played this on a console but find it's much easier to play advanced levels with a mouse and keyboard.
186970926,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.  One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.  Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.  Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.  Overall, Portal"
82985743,english,1,620,"In my playtime, I felt proud for not looking the answers online, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment without giving me a Brain Damage.  Portal 2 definitely live up to what people say about it, the game is Overwhelming and have the right to be considered [b] One of the Best Puzzle Games [/b] created to date, it is really a Must play for PC Gaming, even if you are not into Puzzle games like myself... I will talk about the most striking things for me during my playtime and some thoughts about it.  [list]   [*]  [u] [b] Storyline [/b] [/u] – The Story has improved a lot since the first game, there is now a more noticeable narrative, between the Old Villain (Glados), a new character (Whitley) and the playable character (Chell). There is also a lot from the Origin of the Aperture Science, making it an interesting and solid game to go through.  [*]  [u] [b] Challenging and Mechanics [/b] [/u] – The game has a base mechanic, the Portal Gun, a weapon that shoot 2 different portals that you can go through… It might be simple, but the game keeps giving you new things to work with along the chapters, making it a lot more Challenging as you go further in the game.  [*]  [u] [b] Comedy [/b] [/u] – This game is Hilarious, not only from the well written jokes spoken by  the characters, but the environment has some hidden details that are so funny as well, I would definitely recommend you to read the plaques and frames around the map.  [*]  [u] [b] Aged like Wine [/b] [/u] – Portal 2 was released in April of 2011, back then it was revolutionary, it was a brand new game with new features and mechanics, today, it is not much different, the Graphics is fairly decent and the game still unique. The best thing is that Portal 2 is a lot cheaper than it once was.  [*]  [u] [b] Co-op [/b] [/u] – As Atlas and P-Body, you can play this mode with one more friend and enjoy a variety of more Levels, now with 4 different Portals to work with, which makes the Levels much more complex. The Co-op mode not only uses the already introduced mechanics very well, but it also gives a little touch to the main Story.  [/list]  When I think about it, makes me really impressed that this game was released more than 9 years ago, and it still a [b] Unique [/b] and [b] Original [/b] puzzle game. Portal 2 is a much-improved version from Portal 1, a game that was already great, but this one is a refined version and brought the potential it had… And I must praise the [b] Voice Acting [/b], one of the best features and contribute a lot for it being so Iconic.  Is understandable why people are always memeing and asking for Valve to make more games of every franchise they have; the quality of their games is top notch… Maybe their secret is that they took a long time to develop, from the idea to the playability… We just have to keep waiting.  [u] [b] Rate: 9.2/10.0 [/b] [/u]"

This title demonstrates what it always had shown in the prequel; perfect gameplay and immersive story-telling. Thus, this sequel opens the gateway to the remarkable Portal series.  Now, imagine all of those unanswered questions and obscure mysteries that linger within the first game, and how this sequel answers nearly all those said questions with the utmost scientific explanations through the lines of entertainment from this one. From what I could honestly tell you, this game took the first games mechanics, and widened the story much more bigger and exceptionally better. Portal 2 is by far, worthy of the 'Game of the Year 2011' awards."

24334460,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in April 2011. Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.  Portal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.  The dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.  The co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.  [h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1] Portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it.   Rating: 8.5/10  [h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1] 	- The simple story that ends with an excellent climax. 	- Excellent voice acting. 	- Very good dialogue.  	- The challenging and increasingly complex puzzles. 	- Length.  [h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1] 	- Annoying glitches with the R feedback prompt in single player and frequent crashes via alt tabbing. 	 If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Pros: Great gameplay: Portal 2 offers intricate puzzles that require strategic and logical thinking, making the game highly satisfying. Excellent storyline: The game's story is very engaging and full of unexpected twists. Excellent game mechanics: The game introduces new elements such as gels, which add additional layers of complexity to the puzzles. Great humor: Players can expect many funny situations and jokes that add another dimension to the game. Cons: May be challenging for beginners: The game can be difficult for those who are not accustomed to puzzle games requiring strategic thinking. May be short for some players: The game may be slightly shorter than other games of its kind, which may disappoint some players. Overall, Portal 2 is a great puzzle game that offers excellent gameplay, a great storyline, and excellent game mechanics. Although it may be challenging for beginners and slightly shorter than other games of its kind, it is definitely worth considering for fans of puzzle games."
67688868,english,1,620,"[h1]Great game[/h1]  Portal 2 is a continuation of a very good first part. The game is based on the same mechanisms as the first part, and adds elements that make the game better.  I'm mainly talking about cooperation mode. It's done so well that I think it's more interesting than the single player mode and more fun to play. Of course the storyline is very good, but the ability to solve puzzles with a friend appeals to me more. The boards are made in such a way that we are unlikely to finish them by ourselves and the cooperation is very important here.  Of course, our main object that we need to complete the game is the gun portal, just like in the previous part. It does not introduce any innovations, it works on the same principle as before, that is, it can create two portals between which we can move.  We need to mention the riddles that await us during the game. We will come across simple, trivial puzzles, which will take us literally a while to solve, but we will also find some that we will have to spend more time on. This discrepancy makes the game more diverse and friendly even for younger players.  The graphics are very good for the year of the game release. The locations are nice, they contain various details, despite the old engine, the graphics can really make an amazing impression.  [h1]Summary[/h1]  Portal 2 is definitely one of the best games I've played. It's hard to find any mistakes, the game is just great. We have an interesting storyline, good cooperation mode, easy and difficult puzzles. All in all, the only thing I can attach to is a few bugs, but they are so few that they do not affect the pleasure of the game.

It is just enjoyable if you look at the single player. If you've considered buying this game and haven't yet, do it! The only bad part about this game is that, now that I'm finished with it, I can never experience it for the first time again.  Next Target - Co-Op Campaign"

35453186,english,1,620,"'Portal 2' may just be the most enjoyable single-player game I have ever played - and I will provide you with five reasons why!  - Firstly, the dialogue is brilliant; - The story is surprisingly engaging, and your 'companion', Wheatley, is highly entertaining, although perhaps a little too talkative for some;  - The atmosphere is highly immersive, with a variety of settings ranging from - without spoiling too much - underground to laboratories to factories; - Very rewarding puzzles that challenge you without becoming monotonous or frustrating. This is entirely subjective, though, so some of you may dissent from this view; and - The co-op mode provides more content to enjoy with a friend. Truth be told, I found this mode to be more enjoyable than the single-player! And to that end, the prospect of replaying the co-op mode is certainly appealing IF you are fortunate enough to a) have more than 1 friend who owns the game, and b) own more than one friend.   11/10 GET THE GAME!"
76774117,english,1,620,"Another 𝘤𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘤 game you have to try at least once. Great puzzles that will make you feel like the smartest person on the world, while also maintaining a good storyline with just fantastic characters. I have to say that I think the voice acting is one of the best features of the game, they certainly help make every character be more memorable. Purely because of the voice acting, I can remember what every character's attitude was like despite that it has been 𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘴 since I first played! The campaign and story might be a tad short and some maps might look a bit repetitive, but I personally don't think those are a huge con. Everything else about the game gives shines brighter than a couple small faults. Even after the campaign, you can try out coop or many of the workshop maps! You can continue the magic after the victory from the finale, and there are some 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 creative maps out there. Invite your friend to play and it'll definitely feel like a smart bonding session you should enjoy. Overall, I think this is a great game suited for every type of gamer and I definitely enjoyed it."
110963638,english,1,620,"Where do I even start? First of all the story is awesome and can be replayed so much without loosing its value. The puzzles are difficult but not too difficult to make it infuriating, once you finish a really hard puzzle you feel so much accomplishment. The co-op is one of the best co-op games I have ever played, it has a great story and actually feels like its meant to be a part of the game instead of just some afterthought. There are community made maps for single player and co-op, there are so many well made community maps that feel like they were produced by a game studio. You can even make your own map if you wanted to. SOOO many easter eggs and secrets in this game its unreal. There are barely any glitches that you can just run into during game play. Even the title screen changes depending on where you are in the game. The community for this game is insane. Speedrunning this game is insane, if you somehow feel like you are getting bored of this game, then try speedrunning it. This is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. Oh and i forgot to mention... THE CUSTOM MODS FOR THIS GAME IS INSANE!!!! If you have this game you should really consider downloading the mods for this game, some even just straight up make a whole new game with new mechanics and a whole story with new characters and its just the coolest thing ever, examples are: Portal Stories Mel, Portal Reloaded and Aperture Tag just to name a tiny amount of them. This game is perhaps one of, if not my most favourite game of all time.   TL;DR : Portal 2 is good game, lots to do, 10/10"

It offers a more in-depth journey through aperture that the first game could never accomplish with the original source engine. Campaign characters: Lovable, Exciting, and not annoying. One thing that games forget to do is make their characters good. This game does that in just the right way that it feels like you've built a connection to the characters. Puzzles are easy once you've mastered them, (as I have) but harder once you first play through the game.  Co-op: Amazing. Taking place after the events of the singleplayer campaign, you and your friend (maybe someone who's played the campaign before), can have a really fun time playing. Level editor: Easy and fun to use. I really enjoy building levels for this game, and it shows based on how many I've made. You can also use the hammer editor to build more in-depth and custom levels, but if you are new to level design and want something simple to start you out, this game is for you.  Community levels: Sometimes fun, sometimes boring. You never really know what you're going to get with a level from the workshop. It could be either be a masterpiece made with the hammer editor, or a test chamber made by a 5 year old who thought walking to the exit without having a puzzle was hard. There are also co-op community levels that can yet again be played with your buddy! If you and your partner had a really fun time playing, then you'll probably enjoy working together to beat community levels. Of course you still never know what you're gonna get.  Community mods or 6 part levels: These just add more game that you would want to replay. There are some really good standalone free mods on the steam shop right now if you want to pick them up. Some really good steam mods: Portal stories: Mel, Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Inititive, Thinking with Time Machine. Here is a list of some 6-part levels that I would personally recommend: Wheatley's Unscientific Tests, Minecraft in Portal 2, COSMOGNY and many more.  Only bad point in this game: There are co-op cosmetics that are not required but still act as in-app purchases if you are so inclined to buy them. The entire store is only about 10 dollars which kinda balances it out though.  TL:DR: Campaign is really good. Co-op is really fun. Level editor is a excellent introduction to level design. Community levels you really don't know what you're gonna get. (Played 6 hours of custom levels today and I wanted to die at the end) Includes Co-op community levels so you and your partner can want to die together. (Sarcasm)  FINAL REVIEW: Finally, right? 8/10 Valve, you've knocked it out of the park once again. Hopefully Half life: Alyx will bring us the same experience.  MODERN EDIT: lemme add to this essay a bit, first of all, i first saw this game in the window of a gamestop, on one of those big posters around the time when it came out (i was small and unable to play video games) i really liked the co-op robots, so a while later i finally played it, and ever since i played portal 1, (not so much portal 2) i've absolutely fallen in love with the source engine, so this franchise singlehandedly changed my life in an absolutely insane way, i am now going to go to college for computer engineering and will attempt to get a job at valve (will update if that happens)"

71607900,english,1,620,"[h1] Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to science[/h1]  Portal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to [b]T2: Judgement Day[/b] when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.  [h1]Pros[/h1] +The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot.  +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done.  +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this.  +[b]Stephen Merchant[/b] and [b]J.K Simmons[/b] did an absolutely terrific job. [b]Ellen McLain’s[/b] performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D +Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original! +Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times.  +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game.  +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by [b]Mike Morasky[/b] and [b]The National[/b].  +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend.  +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story.  +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo.  +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support. +Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free. +Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed.  +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support.  +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line.   [h1]Cons[/h1]  -First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV. -Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes.  -Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.    [h1]The Bottom Line[/h1] Portal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson; perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.  The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer.   Highly recommend it to……[b]everyone[/b]. If you’ve read so far then you’re probably interested in the game so won’t hurt giving it a try.   [h1]My Rating: 10/10 [/h1]   Thank You :D"

128382605,english,1,620,"Timeless masterpiece. A textbook example of how a video game should be. Splendid pacing, narrative always flows without major interruptions and the player is always in the action. Superb voice acting (JK Simmons, Ellen McLain, Nolan North) that brings characters to life. A great framework of story that leaves player with lots of answered AND unanswered questions. And it is simply fun.  I wish Valve kept making such great games.

14590312,english,1,620,"I have no idea why I waited so long to review this game. Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up. If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them! ------------------------------- [b]Intro[/b] You know how when you are on vacation and say, ""I am so glad it isn't winter right now.""? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about. ------------------------------- [b]Summary:[/b] This game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programmed-to-be ""idiot"" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play.  ------------------------------- [b]Multi-Player[/b] Then there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totally worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/load-outs into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/mental abilities. ------------------------------- [b]Other important things[/b] The many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the story-line, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.  To dumb it down: ------------------------------- [u][b]Pros[/b][/u] +Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful game-play.  +Wonderful audio and music for a great experience.  +Well-designed maps and challenges.  +Unlimited maps (user-created).  +Fantastic story-line.  +Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials).  +Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable. +Gender neutral. [u][b]++Helps with cognitive brain activity[/b][/u]. ------------------------------- [u][b]Cons[/b][/u] -Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1).  -Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here [spoiler]to me[/spoiler].) -Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.)  -Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.) ------------------------------- [b]My opinionated review[/b] I would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves. ------------------------------- [b]Rating[/b] Out of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing ""Portal transportation"" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definitely get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a [spoiler]97/100[/spoiler] after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating. ------------------------------- [b]Finally[/b] Thanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it! ~thedubmark (I write reviews now :))"
124813542,english,1,620,"An amazing sequel, not only does it keep the atmosphere of the first one, but also upgrades everything, mechanics, graphics, its longer and the story is just great, new characters that add so much more to the universe. Characters that you will never forget.  New puzzles of course that will challenge you and feel satisfying to complete. A beautiful ending and conclusion to Chell's story. It definitely will leave with a desire for more, that you can fulfill with the co-op mode or the myriad of chambers the community has been uploading over the years.  Just get it as soon as you can, and make sure you play Portal 1 first so you can enjoy 2 the most."

61960334,english,1,620,"Posted: April 17, 2011  The highest rated game on Steam, the best puzzle game ever fathomed, the 2nd best game ever created, and #1 worst dev moderation in history.   A game with limitless potential, with a limited ability to reach it.  A game with so much nostalgia, that it's players become forever stuck in 2011.  A game with such good comedy, that people mistake it for a sitcom instead of a puzzle game.  A puzzle game whose players don't like solving puzzles.  A game full of paradoxes (literally).  A game full of sarcasm. ;)  Really and truly, there is no other game like Portal 2 in existence, because there has never been another game that comes close to Portal 2's sheer amount of wasted potential. If only Valve would add a level editor and workshop, people would be able to play free, high quality puzzles indefinitely and never have to buy another game in their life. With the community in charge of creating content, there would be THOUSANDS of new maps for people to play and test their brains with every week! If I were to make predictions, this level editor should contain:  1. All Portal 2 test elements (including reflection gel and sendificators).  2. All the extra, Valve-made fizzler variants (not used in the main campaign for some odd reason).  3. All test elements from Portal 1, including cube deflectors, flux fields, positron orbs, and lifeform sensors.  4. The ability to choose between Portal 2's aesthetic styles (maybe even Portal 1), with matching element variants.  5. The ability to add custom background music from either game (I especially love ""Halted Production"" and ""Sin"").  6. An easy, resizable grid system for more complex and puzzle-relevant architecture.  7. An efficient brush compiler with optimized entity instances.  8. The ability to add custom music and screenshots.  9. Other cool and unique options for different test elements.  It's amazing how VALVe came up with all these cool new ideas; thank you so much for all your work! We can't wait to participate in all the future mapping competitions you'll hold! As for workshop integration, the only problem I foresee is people posting unsolvable puzzles on it. But if they just add a mechanic like Mario Maker where you have to beat your own level before publishing it, that should fix the issue. Oh wait, you say Mario Maker won't be released until 2015, and I just violated our NDA (no dissenters allowed) contract? Welp, guess I better change my identity and make a new account. See you in court, mate."

The story takes a turn and we don't even know who to trust until the end.  The co-op mode is spectacular and quite fun.  The puzzles, compared to the first game, are more complex.

42818803,english,1,620,"Apparently I haven't written a review for this game, so I guess I will now.  For starters, this game is the reason I got a Steam account in the first place. My brother's friend came over with the 360 disc and I stayed up all night playing. Then, of course, he took the game when he left. I immediately wanted to continue playing,  I was hooked from that point forward. Played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 FPS average. It was worth every second of it, honestly.   The campaign is, of course, one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming. The difficulty curve is well-done, the humor is always well-executed and there's tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens. Then, of course, the co-op is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and, of course, another person to cooperate with. I have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike, especially the moments where you have to decide if you REALLY want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partner's relying on. And, to top it all off, there's a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least time/portals with your friends. To this day I occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobody's beaten them, and it's always a pleasant surprise when someone has.  All in all, the game's simply amazing. If the fact that it's the #1 rated game on Steam with 121,015 Positive reviews to 1,586 Negative doesn't indicate its sheer quality, I don't know what will. It's a great game that came from a time when Valve still made them, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart."

We did the mistake of doing the extra *optional* difficult missions right away before doing the main story due to our lack of reading skills, which made things harder than necessary since we sort of skipped the tutorial, but it was a fun but challenging experience nonetheless. We have yet to finish the main co-op or the singleplayer missions, but I would like to praise the game regardless because it truly is a fun game to play where you have to use your brain a little, and when playing co-op you have to work together which was an overall very positive experience.  I will update my review after completing the game if it somehow changes my mind, but for 90% off on sale (cost ~ $1 USD) this game is an absolute steal and I cannot recommend it enough if you grab it while discounted.

177402372,english,1,620,Hilarious dialogue. Deep lore. Difficult puzzle experience. These things make this game and it's prequel my favorite video games I've played. Only complaint is there's not a third game.
28688378,english,1,620,"Honestly I'm still baffled and I'm clueless how to start this review. I'm still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel. I can't wait to jump into the co-op function honestly since the singleplayer was this good.  Valve literally took a look at Portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel. They added new general features like a loading screen, which I didn't find mandatory, and you can see where your portals are placed through walls. They stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map. Speaking of puzzles, they added so many, that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel. They added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want.  You have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land. You have bridges to guide you around the map. You also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button. Finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white. Red gel gives you a speed boost. Blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it, mainly for places that you couldn't portal on before.  Obviously the things previously said aren't the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment. The story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences. It also contains a few plot twists here and there. The places you visit are fairly new but you'll visit some well remembered places from portal. Something they also introduced is companions, the most part of the game you'll have a object travelling with you. One of them is a funny little core with a british accent. Aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths. The jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh.  I highly recommend  that you buy this game, and play it for the rest of the day or week. Turn off your notification, because the game doesn't support tabbing, and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story. (Edit:) You also can choose from many maps from the community to test out so you won't get tired of the story and you can still play."
171628798,english,1,620,"God, it's amazing how well this game holds up even after more than a decade. Both the singleplayer and co-op experiences are top tier in their own way. The voice acting is simply spectacular, the story is intriguing and the puzzles get progressively harder throughout the game (thus providing you with a nice learning curve). This sequel overall is a great step up from the first game and a must-have for virtually any gamer I'd say."
124756887,english,1,620,"One of the greatest games of all time. Your life will be changed, having played it. The writing is hilarious, the story is heart warming and triumphant. The characters are the life of the party. Throw in challenging physics puzzles, witty banter, and the constant threat of doom makes for a story and gameplay that you'll remember for years. The comments and banter get even more meta if the you've played the first one."
142783653,english,1,620,"Prepare yourselves for a sequel that's as witty as a stand-up comedy routine and as mind-bending as a Rubik's cube on steroids. Portal 2, the brainchild of Valve, is a masterclass in puzzle-solving, humor, and creativity that will leave you scratching your head and clutching your sides in laughter. So, let's dive into this Portal to discover why it's more than just a cake-filled lie.  Gameplay and Puzzles: Portal 2 picks up where its predecessor left off, throwing you back into the test chambers of Aperture Science like an unwilling lab rat. Armed with the iconic portal gun, you'll face an array of puzzles that will have you pondering like a philosopher in a think tank.  The puzzles in Portal 2 are as varied as a box of assorted chocolates. From ingenious tests of spatial reasoning to brain-bending platforming challenges, the game keeps you on your toes like a ballet dancer auditioning for a circus. It's like an exhilarating dance of portals, where each move is as precise as a surgeon's scalpel.  But fear not; if you ever find yourself stuck like a fly in honey, the solution is often simpler than a toddler's toy. The ""Aha!"" moments you experience after finally cracking a puzzle are as satisfying as pulling off a magic trick that leaves your audience in awe.  Narrative and Humor: Beyond the puzzles, Portal 2 is a storytelling triumph that will captivate you like a bard's ballad. The game continues the saga of Chell and GLaDOS, the AI with a knack for dark humor and the occasional compliment. GLaDOS's snarky remarks are as sharp as a ninja's shuriken, and her wit will keep you entertained like a comedic duo on stage.  The game introduces new characters like Wheatley, a bumbling personality core with a penchant for bumbling and hilarious British charm. Wheatley's antics add a layer of levity to the experience, like adding sprinkles to an already delightful cupcake.  The narrative unfolds like a captivating novel, keeping you hooked from start to finish like a fish on a line. You'll find yourself emotionally invested in the fate of Chell and the Aperture Science facility, even as you laugh at GLaDOS's passive-aggressive remarks.  Cooperative Multiplayer: Ah, but Portal 2's delights don't end there. The game boasts a cooperative multiplayer mode that's as delightful as having a partner in crime. Working together with a friend (or perhaps a friendly rival) to solve intricate puzzles and communicate through in-game gestures is as charming as watching a synchronized dance routine.  The cooperative puzzles require seamless teamwork and communication, which can lead to hilarious moments of miscommunication and botched portal placements. But remember, in the world of Portal 2, even the most disastrous mistakes can end in peals of laughter.  Graphics and Sound: Portal 2's visual design is as polished as a shiny new Aperture Science test chamber. The environments are a testament to the game's attention to detail, from the decaying ruins of the facility to the pristine test chambers that beckon you like a magician's invitation.  The sound design is equally impressive, with a captivating soundtrack that complements the gameplay like a well-timed drumbeat. The voice acting, particularly the performances of GLaDOS and Wheatley, is nothing short of stellar, deserving accolades like a standing ovation.  Challenging and Rewarding: Portal 2 isn't afraid to challenge your intellect like a sparring match with a grandmaster. But fear not, for the game is as rewarding as a treasure chest filled with rare loot. Each puzzle you conquer feels like an intellectual victory, and the moments of revelation are as delightful as unwrapping a long-awaited gift.  Conclusion: In conclusion, Portal 2 is a sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it in every way like a magician pulling off an awe-inspiring illusion. Its puzzles will twist your mind like a pretzel, and its humor will leave you in stitches like a comedy show.  So, if you're ready to embark on an adventure that's as intellectually stimulating as it is hilarious, enter the world of Portal 2. Whether you're a returning fan of the series or a newcomer to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, prepare to be captivated by the wit, charmed by the characters, and enthralled by the puzzles.  Grab your portal gun, put on your thinking cap, and get ready for a mind-warping, side-splitting experience. Portal 2 is more than just a sequel; it's a comedic masterpiece of puzzle-solving, storytelling, and unforgettable moments. Now, let's open those portals and step through to a world of laughter and brain-teasing delight!"
57536665,english,1,620,"Great coop puzzle game that in a short time span will make you feel dumb as rocks and smarter than Einstein. My wife and I strengthened our marriage bond through this teamwork game and luckily, we were pretty much even as far as figuring stuff out. ;)"
1110736,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun. At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact. The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well. One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay. Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player. I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter.  Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.

78206593,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a phenomenal game by Valve and a true successor to its first one. Not my first time playing this, I've played this before Steam like 4 times and now this completing it in 6 hours is kinda short, looking forward to trying the co-op. Such an amazing story, visuals, gameplay, everything on par especially the design of the gigantic structures just like how in Half-Life there's Black Mesa. Not to forget about the voice acting, in general, is ""the cherry on top"", IMO J.K Simmons nailed it voicing ""Cave Johnson"" making me imagine how his facial expression was every time he talks. I wish if there is a new Portal game in the works or going to be, who knows. Overall, Highly recommended, every gamer or a newcomer should play this. 10/10"

The story is great with interesting characters and a perfect pace. The plot twists are well done and it only tells you what you need to know. The story is also supplemented by the great humor. Of course it's a puzzle game, so the puzzles and level design need to be good. Luckily, they're done flawlessly. On top of that the environments are also amazing and add lots to the world. Once you're done with the story mode there's a level creator that is perfectly made and allows you to do just about anything you want. People have used this to make some crazy and amazing levels. The community, while I'm not sure how active it is now, has always been very helpful and creative. You'll never run out of content as long as talented map creators exist. Definitely a must play for anyone. It's only $20 and worth every penny."

In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.  　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER  　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.  　ENDLESS TESTS  　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.  　Multiplayer: 　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ  　　Co-op:    ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Storyline:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Graphics:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺  　  　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.  　　　　[i]VALVe made another good 　　game. With good intelligent humor, 　　charismatic characters and unusual 　　interesting gameplay.  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　As expected, nine out of ten [9/10]."

114069283,english,1,620,there is no describable feeling for the pang of sadness I get whenever I replay a Valve game knowing they will never put their all into a game ever again. Alyx is nice but the earlier half-life games and portal were something special.
49246649,english,1,620,"I cannot believe it took me this long to write a review about this game. I wrote an essay about how good it is for an English class before I wrote a review talking about how good it is.  Long overdue, I honestly don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece. This game is hands down the best one I have ever played in my life. An improvement on the first one in all the right ways, this game is potentially the only singleplayer experience I have had a proper craving for, the only experience that I have genuinely felt that going back and replaying is the thing I want to be doing.  In the essay that I wrote about Portal 2, I spoke at length about all of the fancy rhetoric that the game employs to convey various emotions and force the player into a mindset. The big thing I noticed was how well the game uses the physically small map to portray this MASSIVE sense of scale. In the essay I focused more on how it forces the player into experiencing something akin to a ""trapped freedom"", where you have the opportunity to do whatever you want but in a certain space. In retrospect, I should simply have written about the way that the game conveys lonely companionship, fearful trust, and reliance on someone openly trying to kill you. It tears out your deepest emotions and plays with them, trying to and succeeding in making you feel two conflicting emotions simultaneously. This is a powerful way to write a story and Portal 2 pulls it off flawlessly.  With a mix of top-tier voice acting, fluid animation, realistic interactions, interesting characters, an amazing story, the usage of a silent protagonist, and the lack of cutscenes entirely, the game feels realistic and involved. The game doesn't break immersion for a second. While remaining tense, it manages to employ humour, and does everything tastefully.  I can't rave about everything in one review because it frankly will turn into another 20 page essay like the last one did. The TL;DR of this is that the game does everything a game should do flawlessly.   This is the best game ever made and nothing can change my mind."

Puzzle gameplay has never been so immersive or atmospheric - this is Valve at their finest. Must-play."
8064757,english,1,620,"If you played Portal 1 and liked it, you are going to love Portal 2, it has everything that the previous game had to offer and much more!  The campaign is much larger than the previous one, with a bunch of new mechanics as well. What really shines here though is the fantastic voice acting from the antagonists, Wheatley is hilarious with his british accent and GLaDOS just being cynical and awesome as always! It has a lot more challenges as well and the multiplayer works perfectly.   The game is a masterpiece indeed!"

187593044,english,1,620,"Rating: 10/10  Developed by Valve and released in 2011, Portal 2 is a masterpiece of puzzle-platforming, featuring brilliant level design, sharp humor, and one of the most memorable narratives in gaming. Expanding on the mechanics of the original Portal (2007), this sequel introduces new puzzle elements, a longer and richer story, and an incredibly fun co-op mode. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys brain-teasing challenges and witty writing.  Why Portal 2 is a Masterpiece 🧩 Brilliant Puzzle Mechanics The core of Portal 2’s gameplay remains the portal gun, allowing players to create two connected portals to navigate through puzzles. However, this sequel introduces new elements like:  Excursion Funnels (tractor beams that carry objects and players) Repulsion Gel (bouncy surfaces for high jumps) Propulsion Gel (speed-enhancing surfaces) Light Bridges and Aerial Faith Plates Each of these elements adds depth and variety, keeping puzzles fresh throughout the campaign.  🎭 Incredible Writing and Humor Portal 2’s dialogue is legendary. The writing team, led by Erik Wolpaw, delivers some of the funniest and smartest lines in gaming history. GLaDOS, the sarcastic AI antagonist, returns with passive-aggressive insults and dark humor, while Wheatley, voiced by Stephen Merchant, provides an energetic and often hilarious presence. The game’s humor is perfectly balanced, making it both funny and deeply engaging.  🏢 Expanded World-Building Unlike the first game, which mostly took place in sterile test chambers, Portal 2 explores the history of Aperture Science. Players venture into old, decayed sections of the facility, uncovering audio logs of Cave Johnson, the eccentric founder of Aperture. This deeper lore makes the world feel more alive and mysterious.  🤝 Co-op Mode – A Perfect Two-Player Experience Portal 2 features a fully-fledged cooperative mode, where two players control Atlas and P-Body, two testing robots. Co-op puzzles require teamwork, timing, and communication, making it one of the best cooperative experiences in gaming. It’s brilliantly designed, ensuring both players feel equally involved in solving the challenges.  🎶 Memorable Soundtrack Portal 2’s soundtrack, composed by Mike Morasky, features dynamic music that adapts to player actions. The game also ends with another hilarious song from GLaDOS, ""Want You Gone"", following up on the iconic ""Still Alive"" from the first game.  Are There Any Flaws? ❌ Some Puzzles May Feel Too Easy for Veterans Compared to the original Portal, some experienced puzzle-solvers might find Portal 2’s difficulty a bit more forgiving. However, the co-op mode and community-created test chambers provide plenty of challenging content.  ❌ No Portal 3... Yet The biggest flaw? Valve never made a Portal 3. 😢  Conclusion Portal 2 is a masterpiece that balances clever puzzle design, fantastic humor, and deep world-building into an unforgettable experience. Whether you're playing solo or with a friend, the game delivers one of the most rewarding and entertaining adventures ever made. It remains one of Valve’s greatest achievements and is highly recommended for any gamer.  🔹 Rating: 10/10 – Brilliant puzzles, unforgettable characters, and one of the best co-op experiences in gaming."
135872966,english,1,620,Portal2 is on my list of favorite games that I like to go back and revisit every year or so. I have yet to play a game that has impressed me as much as Portal2. Some come close but the engaging puzzles and intriguing story are hard to beat. I really hope they make a true Portal3 or Half-Life/Portal crossover and continue the story.  *side note: I originally played this on a console but find it's much easier to play advanced levels with a mouse and keyboard.
186970926,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.  One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.  Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.  Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.  Overall, Portal"
82985743,english,1,620,"In my playtime, I felt proud for not looking the answers online, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment without giving me a Brain Damage.  Portal 2 definitely live up to what people say about it, the game is Overwhelming and have the right to be considered [b] One of the Best Puzzle Games [/b] created to date, it is really a Must play for PC Gaming, even if you are not into Puzzle games like myself... I will talk about the most striking things for me during my playtime and some thoughts about it.  [list]   [*]  [u] [b] Storyline [/b] [/u] – The Story has improved a lot since the first game, there is now a more noticeable narrative, between the Old Villain (Glados), a new character (Whitley) and the playable character (Chell). There is also a lot from the Origin of the Aperture Science, making it an interesting and solid game to go through.  [*]  [u] [b] Challenging and Mechanics [/b] [/u] – The game has a base mechanic, the Portal Gun, a weapon that shoot 2 different portals that you can go through… It might be simple, but the game keeps giving you new things to work with along the chapters, making it a lot more Challenging as you go further in the game.  [*]  [u] [b] Comedy [/b] [/u] – This game is Hilarious, not only from the well written jokes spoken by  the characters, but the environment has some hidden details that are so funny as well, I would definitely recommend you to read the plaques and frames around the map.  [*]  [u] [b] Aged like Wine [/b] [/u] – Portal 2 was released in April of 2011, back then it was revolutionary, it was a brand new game with new features and mechanics, today, it is not much different, the Graphics is fairly decent and the game still unique. The best thing is that Portal 2 is a lot cheaper than it once was.  [*]  [u] [b] Co-op [/b] [/u] – As Atlas and P-Body, you can play this mode with one more friend and enjoy a variety of more Levels, now with 4 different Portals to work with, which makes the Levels much more complex. The Co-op mode not only uses the already introduced mechanics very well, but it also gives a little touch to the main Story.  [/list]  When I think about it, makes me really impressed that this game was released more than 9 years ago, and it still a [b] Unique [/b] and [b] Original [/b] puzzle game. Portal 2 is a much-improved version from Portal 1, a game that was already great, but this one is a refined version and brought the potential it had… And I must praise the [b] Voice Acting [/b], one of the best features and contribute a lot for it being so Iconic.  Is understandable why people are always memeing and asking for Valve to make more games of every franchise they have; the quality of their games is top notch… Maybe their secret is that they took a long time to develop, from the idea to the playability… We just have to keep waiting.  [u] [b] Rate: 9.2/10.0 [/b] [/u]"

Now, imagine all of those unanswered questions and obscure mysteries that linger within the first game, and how this sequel answers nearly all those said questions with the utmost scientific explanations through the lines of entertainment from this one. From what I could honestly tell you, this game took the first games mechanics, and widened the story much more bigger and exceptionally better.

24334460,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in April 2011. Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.  Portal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.  The dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.  The co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.  [h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1] Portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it.   Rating: 8.5/10  [h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1] 	- The simple story that ends with an excellent climax. 	- Excellent voice acting. 	- Very good dialogue.  	- The challenging and increasingly complex puzzles. 	- Length.  [h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1] 	- Annoying glitches with the R feedback prompt in single player and frequent crashes via alt tabbing. 	 If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Of course the storyline is very good, but the ability to solve puzzles with a friend appeals to me more. The boards are made in such a way that we are unlikely to finish them by ourselves and the cooperation is very important here.  Of course, our main object that we need to complete the game is the gun portal, just like in the previous part. It does not introduce any innovations, it works on the same principle as before, that is, it can create two portals between which we can move.  We need to mention the riddles that await us during the game. We will come across simple, trivial puzzles, which will take us literally a while to solve, but we will also find some that we will have to spend more time on. This discrepancy makes the game more diverse and friendly even for younger players.  The graphics are very good for the year of the game release. The locations are nice, they contain various details, despite the old engine, the graphics can really make an amazing impression.  [h1]Summary[/h1]  Portal 2 is definitely one of the best games I've played. It's hard to find any mistakes, the game is just great. We have an interesting storyline, good cooperation mode, easy and difficult puzzles. All in all, the only thing I can attach to is a few bugs, but they are so few that they do not affect the pleasure of the game.

38663794,english,1,620,"Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece. The voice acting is some of the best that I've ever heard, the puzzles are just hard enough, the game runs beautifully. It is just enjoyable if you look at the single player. If you've considered buying this game and haven't yet, do it! The only bad part about this game is that, now that I'm finished with it, I can never experience it for the first time again.  Next Target - Co-Op Campaign"
137189353,english,1,620,"One of the best games I've ever played. Amazing mechanics, awsome  story and great graphics. Congrats to the developers. 10/10. This need a sequel 100%."
35453186,english,1,620,"'Portal 2' may just be the most enjoyable single-player game I have ever played - and I will provide you with five reasons why!  - Firstly, the dialogue is brilliant; - The story is surprisingly engaging, and your 'companion', Wheatley, is highly entertaining, although perhaps a little too talkative for some;  - The atmosphere is highly immersive, with a variety of settings ranging from - without spoiling too much - underground to laboratories to factories; - Very rewarding puzzles that challenge you without becoming monotonous or frustrating. This is entirely subjective, though, so some of you may dissent from this view; and - The co-op mode provides more content to enjoy with a friend. Truth be told, I found this mode to be more enjoyable than the single-player! And to that end, the prospect of replaying the co-op mode is certainly appealing IF you are fortunate enough to a) have more than 1 friend who owns the game, and b) own more than one friend.   11/10 GET THE GAME!"
76774117,english,1,620,"Another 𝘤𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘤 game you have to try at least once. Great puzzles that will make you feel like the smartest person on the world, while also maintaining a good storyline with just fantastic characters. I have to say that I think the voice acting is one of the best features of the game, they certainly help make every character be more memorable. Purely because of the voice acting, I can remember what every character's attitude was like despite that it has been 𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘴 since I first played! The campaign and story might be a tad short and some maps might look a bit repetitive, but I personally don't think those are a huge con. Everything else about the game gives shines brighter than a couple small faults. Even after the campaign, you can try out coop or many of the workshop maps! You can continue the magic after the victory from the finale, and there are some 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 creative maps out there. Invite your friend to play and it'll definitely feel like a smart bonding session you should enjoy. Overall, I think this is a great game suited for every type of gamer and I definitely enjoyed it."
110963638,english,1,620,"Where do I even start? First of all the story is awesome and can be replayed so much without loosing its value. The puzzles are difficult but not too difficult to make it infuriating, once you finish a really hard puzzle you feel so much accomplishment. The co-op is one of the best co-op games I have ever played, it has a great story and actually feels like its meant to be a part of the game instead of just some afterthought. There are community made maps for single player and co-op, there are so many well made community maps that feel like they were produced by a game studio. You can even make your own map if you wanted to. SOOO many easter eggs and secrets in this game its unreal. There are barely any glitches that you can just run into during game play. Even the title screen changes depending on where you are in the game. The community for this game is insane. Speedrunning this game is insane, if you somehow feel like you are getting bored of this game, then try speedrunning it. This is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. Oh and i forgot to mention... THE CUSTOM MODS FOR THIS GAME IS INSANE!!!! If you have this game you should really consider downloading the mods for this game, some even just straight up make a whole new game with new mechanics and a whole story with new characters and its just the coolest thing ever, examples are: Portal Stories Mel, Portal Reloaded and Aperture Tag just to name a tiny amount of them. This game is perhaps one of, if not my most favourite game of all time.   TL;DR : Portal 2 is good game, lots to do, 10/10"

It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.  In the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.  After that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.  And to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game.  It is a gift that just keeps on giving.  With the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, [b]Portal 2[/b] rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games.  It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence.  If you haven’t yet tried it, now is the time.  There are hours of entertainment waiting for you.

101390468,english,1,620,"Amazing Game 10/10  Story: 10/10  Gameplay: 10/10  Puzzles: 9,5/10 If you aren't a genius, then you will need a guide!"
64219641,english,1,620,"Amazing game. Truly defines the puzzle genre, while acting as a great sequel to portal. Read the end for a TL:DR.  Campaign is flawless. It offers a more in-depth journey through aperture that the first game could never accomplish with the original source engine. Campaign characters: Lovable, Exciting, and not annoying. One thing that games forget to do is make their characters good. This game does that in just the right way that it feels like you've built a connection to the characters. Puzzles are easy once you've mastered them, (as I have) but harder once you first play through the game.  Co-op: Amazing. Taking place after the events of the singleplayer campaign, you and your friend (maybe someone who's played the campaign before), can have a really fun time playing. Level editor: Easy and fun to use. I really enjoy building levels for this game, and it shows based on how many I've made. You can also use the hammer editor to build more in-depth and custom levels, but if you are new to level design and want something simple to start you out, this game is for you.  Community levels: Sometimes fun, sometimes boring. You never really know what you're going to get with a level from the workshop. It could be either be a masterpiece made with the hammer editor, or a test chamber made by a 5 year old who thought walking to the exit without having a puzzle was hard. There are also co-op community levels that can yet again be played with your buddy! If you and your partner had a really fun time playing, then you'll probably enjoy working together to beat community levels. Of course you still never know what you're gonna get.  Community mods or 6 part levels: These just add more game that you would want to replay. There are some really good standalone free mods on the steam shop right now if you want to pick them up. Some really good steam mods: Portal stories: Mel, Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Inititive, Thinking with Time Machine. Here is a list of some 6-part levels that I would personally recommend: Wheatley's Unscientific Tests, Minecraft in Portal 2, COSMOGNY and many more.  Only bad point in this game: There are co-op cosmetics that are not required but still act as in-app purchases if you are so inclined to buy them. The entire store is only about 10 dollars which kinda balances it out though.  TL:DR: Campaign is really good. Co-op is really fun. Level editor is a excellent introduction to level design. Community levels you really don't know what you're gonna get. (Played 6 hours of custom levels today and I wanted to die at the end) Includes Co-op community levels so you and your partner can want to die together. (Sarcasm)  FINAL REVIEW: Finally, right? 8/10 Valve, you've knocked it out of the park once again. Hopefully Half life: Alyx will bring us the same experience.  MODERN EDIT: lemme add to this essay a bit, first of all, i first saw this game in the window of a gamestop, on one of those big posters around the time when it came out (i was small and unable to play video games) i really liked the co-op robots, so a while later i finally played it, and ever since i played portal 1, (not so much portal 2) i've absolutely fallen in love with the source engine, so this franchise singlehandedly changed my life in an absolutely insane way, i am now going to go to college for computer engineering and will attempt to get a job at valve (will update if that happens)"
174701541,english,1,646910,"Eh, for a $1 USD you can't complain. The game isn't bad, with the little time I played today I drove all the way from California to New York and it was a fun drive. At least Ubisoft has stated that they are going to give this game an offline mode which is fantastic considering they up and left The Crew 1 and shutdown all servers. You can't play it anymore, and they need some good reputation at the moment.   Ubisoft/Ivory Tower haven't stated anything that the game is going offline, but it seems like it might sometime soon with future-proofing the game and giving it a 98% discount on all platforms."
165701345,english,0,646910,"Ubisoft destroyed The Crew to force people to buy the sequel, while also refusing to refund anyone or[b] enable the hidden offline mode that is already in the game.[/b]  If you want to make a difference and stop this from becoming the industry standard in the future: https://www.stopkillinggames.com/"
174689773,english,1,646910,"I have a feeling that this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car, and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies. Still worth the price tho, beautiful graphics and racists"
174895903,english,1,646910,"Alright. [i]The Crew 2[/i]. Judging from the current all-time high concurrent peak player counts for the game, I'd say a lot of people are aware of this game currently being priced at one dollar (and less in some regions). And a lot of people have bought the game as a result of this stunning deal. Including myself. Just to get it out of the way, if you have something to say about The Crew 1's removal, go to the game forum. I'm not interested in the topic as part of this review. So...  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984820  I am confident I would never have bought this game had it not been a buck, and I'm also confident that a lot of people have the same opinion. But since it was a buck, I did in fact buy it, and I'm glad I did. It's hella fun. The gameplay loop of joining events and races, using the cash you earn to buy new vehicles and such, and upgrading your vehicles with loot rewards from events and races, is pretty simple. But it is also effective. As you progress, you will unlock more events and races, and because they are located across the lower 48 States, you get a wide variety of settings for everything. From cities to mountains to forests to lakes to deserts to meteor craters to rain to snow to beaches and on and on, there is a vast array of different types of courses and tracks to enjoy. And there are a wide variety of types of races and events as well. From standard track races to boat races to plane aerobatics to demolition derbies, and so on.  The sheer volume of content is quite impressive. And, the various vehicles, be they cars or trucks or bikes or planes or boats or dune buggies or whatever...they all handle nicely and feel good to drive in. Each of these is upgradeable in many ways, which will increase their performance, handling, speed, and just generally make them function better and better as you progress.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984770  There is a campaign of sorts, where you try to become the lead racer in a few different styles, but it's also easy enough to ignore that in favor of simply racing around, upgrading your vehicles, wandering around your crib, and simply free roaming. And free roaming is a lot of fun in and of itself. Mostly, it's a huge sightseeing trip, where you can also try to beat other player's records with jumps, speed, and so on; that you come across while driving around. And setting some records of your own for other people to beat. And there is a decent photography mini game all across the States where you will take pictures of animals, special vehicles and such to gain more cash and follower.  And gaining followers is really the sub goal that most impacts your playthrough. The number of followers you have determines how popular your racer is, which in turn unlocks new vehicle options and race/event options. Just about everything you do will earn you new followers (and cash).  Also, you can play with other players and even if you're not, you will see them all over the map. At this moment in time (the time of this review being written), no matter where you are, somebody else is nearby. And there are a lot of player created activities as well. Plus, you can co-op with friends if you get bored of solo play. So really, the content just keeps expanding as you explore what the game has to offer.  Visually, the game looks great. It has a 60 FPS cap, which isn't anything to brag about, but somehow, the devs have made the most out of that limitation and made a game that has a never-ending supply of screenshot moments. The audio is also well done. The songs themselves are very cool. The dialogue is basically all ""hey bro"" Extreme Games fodder, but it's fun and definitely appropriate.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3330111663  You will need Ubisoft Connect to play this. I don't care at all about that, but you might. And some people are having an issue with the game crashing if they have other non-Steam clients linked to their Ubi account. I have not had that issue personally and have it linked to both PSN and Epic as well, but if you do, you will need to unlink everything except Steam and that will resolve the crashing issue apparently. No idea how or why that is what it is or why it only affects some players. It's been a bug free experience for me though with a 3070 and an i5.  Now, should you also buy the season pass? I personally have no intention of doing so. There's no new content, and I don't care about getting a few extra cars and some swag. But the base game, offering what can easily be hundreds and even thousands of hours of content for one dollar. That is something I can definitely get behind. I can't think of a better deal in gaming at this moment. Now, if you miss or skip this one-dollar promotion they have going on right now, value will be more of...you know..., a [i]your mileage may vary[/i] type thing....

174302344,english,1,646910,"Forza Horizon fan.  Having fun in Crew 2 with all the different vehicle and event types.  C2 runs smooth, no bugs, and each event type is well designed and implemented.  Only frustration, I did not reach Platinum division in the Summit my first week. Being rich in Forza means you can buy and tune a competitive vehicle.  In Crew 2, you buy the base vehicle, but you have to grind for upgrade parts.   FH has classes (B, A, S1, S2).  C2 does not.  All vehicles of same type in C2 have same max tune value. FH no Nitro, C2, Nitro is primary factor. C2, no Auction House nor any way to sell vehicles. C2, leaderboards are more integral, and are a focus of endgame/seasons (Summit). I have over 700 vehicles in FH5.  In C2 earning vehicles is a MUCH slower process, and so far, I don't see much incentive to collect cars, beyond appearance and Summit requirements.  Do different Street Race cars handle differently at max stats??  excluding part affixes and awd."

[/td] [/tr] [/table]  [i] My impression of the game kept on changing at each progressing 5 hours interval. This review was framed after investing 30+ hours into the game and concluding the final rivalry races. The initial hours were so repulsive and full of meh impressions. But once you get a hold of a particular vehicle type and its handling, it’s all fun and excitement.[/i]  [h1][b] 📝Story/Plot:[/b][/h1] Just a generic plot setup to give your grind some motive and goal. A rookie entering the world of racing and guess what, some organizers see his potential and gave him a chance without even seeing him race beforehand. Just be #1 all around the events and conclude your journey after beating the top dogs who were the organizers too.  [h1][b]🎮Gameplay:[/b][/h1] [b]Initial impression-[/b] Imagine a hot girl with no personality. That’s the first 5-minute impression of The Crew 2. Starting off with high budget cinematics and performing short lap segment races while shifting to a new vehicle again and again. Sounds cool right? Wait until you see the whole f*cking world curve like in the movie Inception and Doctor Strange. At this point, my jaw was indisputably touching the ground. But just after completing a normal event race, it hit me with gloom and awkwardness. All that cinematic brag of “Speed is Life” and bla bla comes down to a slow race with the road looking like a low texture road. Like WTF?  [b]Mechanics/Controllability-[/b] I know it’s not a real sim racing game, nor advertised as a pure arcade. It’s unique on its own. But I feel like not giving it a category works as a bypass for some faulty mechanics. Cars feel slightly slow and weigh a ton on the controller. The purpose of a racing game is to acknowledge the speed atmosphere, which was only endured with top cars. Cars are not at all hard to control, rather easy and amusing. It’s the damn AI that makes all the races so tryhard. You are in lead for 97% of the race and suddenly an AI got a God’s hand and achieved supersonic speed. If you are thinking of bumping into them and play dirty, well have fun bumping a rubber band. All these aspects are blades of the same sword. AI feels difficult- what a tryhard game/Thank God it’s not cheap easy. Perspective matters here. I am not against it. Surely it’s sometimes annoying, but it iz what it iz.   It’s easy to understand how ground vehicles operate, steer, brake, drift, boost. But you are not familiar with aeroplane controls. Despite that, the first intro race makes you race an aeroplane. Instead of crossing checkpoints with my plane, I was crashing into enormous buildings and respawning. A terrible scenario that gets fixed in later event races where they teach you all aeroplane controls bit by bit.  [b]Open World-[/b] Take on the American motorsports scene as you explore across the entire USA. Being able to drive different vehicles like cars, bikes, boats and planes in the same open-world means not only you are free to drift your car on street roads, tread speedboat through the waterways but fly high across the sky too. Befitting pillars for the open-world statement. Now we know there are no restrictions, but what about interactables? Unfortunately, that’s a guessing game. Oh, I have a sharp turn incoming and I have to drift? Let’s do this then. You are halfway in your drift airmailing all those bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts in space, but suddenly you see a bench in between. That’s your stoppage. These randomly placed objects like benches or parked cars don’t follow Newton’s Law. They just wanna remain stationary no matter how hard you hit them. Trust me, these little objects ruined a lot of my lap times.  [b]Variety-[/b] You can use the astonishing top-notch live map, which single-handedly increases the game score by 2. Like how they even made it render the entire game in a 3D model just by a single click. Moving forward, the complete map contains various types of events/races you can take part in. Just for clarification, there are not AI vs races only. You can take part in a race against time, drifting, freestyling and a lot of car chases too. As I said, you are buying a complete package of the racing genre with multiple vehicle types. But there seems to be a hollow part of the story. During cinematics, you can easily see the top-quality work put together and the exciting race descriptions they narrate. But in reality, you won’t find those races in action. One cinematic had an image of a monster truck jumping out of a plane with a parachute, but there’s nothing present like that. They escalated the expectations through cinematic dialogues but disappointed us in the end. It’s not completely devastating as the default variety is already more than enough.  [b]PvP/Grinding-[/b] Sadly, you can’t run away from the “Look, there’s a level 1 guy with lvl99 car” scenario. It’s Ubisoft, which means expect a lot of transactions. Buy bundles, buy a season pass (Motorpass), or add in-game currency and get any high-speed car you want, but if you don’t wanna spend a penny, good luck grinding your a*s out. Be a part of a crew and evade the boredom of grinding alone.  [h1][b]📷Graphics:[/b][/h1] Enjoy a pizza full of delicious and uplifting toppings added on a half-cooked bread base. Now all your bites will have a random taste. Some will please your tastebuds, and some will taste like cardboard. The object detailing in the open world is great, but their textures, Oh Lord. Never expected to witness those low texture brick buildings from a 2018 game. Like, come on; all the vehicles, roadside objects, even dirt tracks look so good. Then why the buildings and gravel roads look like a dusty mirror. To avoid these bad graphic races, I played air and water races the most.  [h1][b]📝Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]  [b]Pros-[/b] [list]     [*]Big Open-world.     [*]Character and vehicle customization.     [*]Good chunk of playable time.      [*]Multiple vehicle types.     [*]Varied races and challenges.     [*]Offline or Online races. [/list]  [b]Cons-[/b] [list]     [*]Grind vs PayToWin is real.     [*]Semi cooked graphics.     [*]Annoying indestructible objects.     [*]No dynamic weather in the open world. [/list]  [h1][b]🏷️Tips to new players:[/b][/h1] Keep in mind, you can drift your plane. Without this, you are going to kiss the land whenever you take a flight. Don’t start PvP races until you reach at least the Famous rank. There are no restrictions on which racetrack to follow. So cut the track however you want. The first one to cross the checkpoint is the winner. Change resolution to borderless. Otherwise, whenever you will Alt+Tab, the game will start re-syncing, which wastes 4-10 seconds of your life every time.  [h1][b]😇Honest Rating:[/b][/h1] If you are looking for that NFS arcade or real sim racing like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, then just buy them instead. It’s nowhere perfect or overly marvellous. But I can assure you, if you invest enough hours into the game, you will adore it even as toxic relation. Only buy on big sale!  Rating: 8/10 Best world bending I ever saw."
164128496,english,0,646910,"Doesn't matter how good this game is if it just gets taken away from you whenever they decide they've taken enough money off of you.

180604033,english,1,646910,"Many people say that this game is bad, assuming that it is because of the horrible graphics you will always notice. Personally, this is one of the games that I would recommend to give some time to spend on because it is fun and the player has freedom to cruise around and do numerous activities whether you play by yourself or with a built crew.  With the ability to switch to another vehicle whether air or water while driving, you get to realize that there are so many things that this game offers. For me, this is an awesome game, though the sole issue I have with this game is that it is only playable ONLINE. I wish there is a feature where in you can drive around and participate in races even without the online feature or just disabled online mode. In addition to the free-roaming, there are races that provide the player a huge drop of cash and with the ability to increase the number of drop of car parts and money by progressing your ICON stats, you are guaranteed wealthy enough to purchase numerous vehicles of different disciplines that are so many that I am speechless of this game and how amazing it is.  To conclude. The Crew 2 is fun. Surely some will say the graphic renditions, especially buildings and environments have awful sight to it, but still, with all honesty, this is a fun game to play. If you purchased the Gold Edition, you will receive free, if I am not mistaken, 22 vehicles for free and few exclusive vehicles that you can get for free."
171979040,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2, a game where you can switch from driving a hypercar to piloting a plane faster than you can say ""Did I just clip that skyscraper?""  The game’s map is a condensed version of the USA, which means you can drive from New York to Los Angeles in about 30 minutes. Take that, real-world traffic!  Switching between vehicles is as simple as pressing a button. One moment you're cruising down the streets of Miami, and the next, you're free-falling from the sky because you accidentally transformed into a boat mid-air. Pro tip: boats don't fly.  The variety of races is vast, and so are the number of trees I've crashed into while attempting to pull off that ""totally planned"" drift. And let's not forget the photo mode challenges. Nothing says ""professional photographer"" like trying to snap a pic of a flamingo while barrel-rolling in a jet.  In conclusion, the game is pretty fun, sure the handling physics aren't anything like NFS of Forza, but the game has its charms."
174694396,english,0,646910,"[h1] Stop Destroying Videogames [/h1]  [b]  European Citizens' Initiative :  Video games have grown into an industry with billions of customers worth hundreds of billions of euros. During this time, a specific business practice in the industry has been slowly emerging that is not only an assault on basic consumer rights but is destroying the medium itself.  An increasing number of publishers are selling video games that are required to connect through the internet to the game publisher, or ""phone home"" to function. While this is not a problem in itself, when support ends for these types of games, very often publishers simply sever the connection necessary for the game to function, proceed to destroy all working copies of the game, and implement extensive measures to prevent the customer from repairing the game in any way.  This practice is effectively robbing customers of their purchases and makes restoration impossible. Besides being an affront on consumer rights, video games themselves are unique creative works. Like film, or music, one cannot be simply substituted with another. By destroying them, it represents a creative loss for everyone involved and erases history in ways not possible in other mediums.  Existing laws and consumer agencies are ill-prepared to protect customers against this practice. The ability for a company to destroy an item it has already sold to the customer long after the fact is not something that normally occurs in other industries. With license agreements required to simply run the game, many existing consumer protections are circumvented. This practice challenges the concept of ownership itself, where the customer is left with nothing after ""buying"" a game.     We wish to invoke Article 17 §1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [EUR-Lex - 12012P/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] – “No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss.” – This practice deprives European citizens of their property by making it so that they lose access to their product an indeterminate/arbitrary amount of time after the point of sale. We wish to see this remedied, at the core of this Initiative.   We also invoke Title XV of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)[EUR-Lex - 12012E/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] and the following TFEU Articles as our justification for and the Union’s imperative to respond to this initiative:  Article 169 – Per §1, the EU has an obligation “to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection…to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers”. We believe this practice infringes upon or requires correction to be commensurate with the EU’s obligation. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with videogames.    Article 12 – “Consumer protection requirements shall be taken into account in defining and implementing other Union policies and activities.” Given that this practice extends across Member States and beyond the EU, the Union’s actions regarding this practice ought to keep consumer protection in mind. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with video games.  Article 114, §3 – “The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection… Within their respective powers, the European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective” This practice undermines the high level of consumer protection that the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council takes as the basis of law in the Union, and their objectives of establishing and maintaining the functioning of an internal market as described in §1 of this Article, and Article 26 TFEU.[/b]  [h1] THE CREW 2 IS NEXT!

173366642,english,0,646910,"I can't express how deeply unsatisfying the non-physics-based driving feels; it's worse than a cheap arcade motorcycle game. Furthermore, online required (see what happened to The Crew 1), terrible, LONG, extremely frequent cut-scenes, very poor UI decisions (I couldn't even figure out how to exit the game!), FPS and resolution limited, a mandatory anti-cheat driver, and mediocre graphics means that there are far better games out there. The only reason I can see to purchase this game is for its boat racing, but even then, it's boring, in my opinion.

180954300,english,0,646910,The Ubisoft app tells me the game will be bound to my account but then says it can't authenticate ownership of the product. And what is the point of buying it on Steam if I have to use a separate launcher to play it! (not that I could even play at all)
172145788,english,1,646910,"I honestly kind of expected this game to be horrible. But Once I finally got it working, it was a lot more enjoyable then I planned it to be. The main things that strongly irritated me was having to Launch Ubisoft literally anytime I want to play this game, and the fact that Drifting is (not hard but) annoyingly more complex than other racing games."
177818626,english,1,646910,"I'd say this game is worth a try. There’s plenty of racing, though it’s kind of like the towers in Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry—you’re constantly grinding for something.  About that grind: collecting tuning parts (to get bonuses, you need to put together a full set of the same color and type) can be a hassle. Don’t expect to complete a set easily—you’ll likely be replaying the same race multiple times. There are around 200 races in total, each with three difficulty levels. I’ve cleared 88% of the main races and about 51% of the three other categories, and I’m nowhere near completing a full set on any car. But honestly, you don't need a full set. Once you max out your car’s power, you can just blow past the AI ​​opponents and enjoy the view.  And the views here are worth it. The game is gorgeous, and the scale is impressive. You truly feel like you’re driving across an entire country. The map might even be bigger than Euro Truck Simulator's, even with all the DLC. Each state has its own distinct look and vibe, and I loved the variety.  The one downside is that the game kind of forces you to try different modes. I wasn’t really into planes or Off-Road, though the boat races were surprisingly fun. Some modes just feel pointless, like Derby. It’s just cars bouncing around with no real destruction physics. And F1 racing doesn’t really fit either—the arcade physics don’t do it justice, and when you’re driving an F1 car off-road, it’s just weird.  At first, I hated Off-Road races and was ready to skip them. I tried MX, Aerobatics, and Touring Car instead, but that sense of “incomplete” pushed me to finish those 20 Off-Road races, unlock the boss, and complete all the achievements.  Overall, the game’s pretty easy—maybe too easy. To make it more challenging, you’d have to clear everything on the easiest difficulty first, and with a game this big, that can get tiring. I put in 30 hours and only got through half the game. I really enjoyed the hypercars, though; I’d be down for even more long races that last an hour or more. There’s something special about speeding down a wide-open highway, listening to music, and soaking up the graphics.  In short, there’s something for everyone here, so I’d say it’s worth a thumbs-up."
176423165,english,1,646910,"Ubisoft is undeniably awful and I hold no love for them, but this ended up possibly being the best dollar I ever spent. I got it originally because the discount was just too much to pass up but didn't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as I have and will continue to do. This title made me realize I love racing games.   I don't know how deep any of the activities are compared to the competition in the genre but it's pure good fun. There's lots of variety in event types and tons of vehicles with impressive customization. The drawbacks are that the characters are insufferable, just about every line of dialog is cringe inducing and the voice acting is wretchedly bad — but fortunately none of that matters in a game like this. Maybe that's a plus if you can laugh at it, but for me skipping just about all of it is mandatory.   Just turn up the music and drive! Or fly! Or sail."
174581978,english,0,646910,"I decided to play this game rather than leave it in the steam library simply because Ubisoft decided to close the server of the crew 1 rather than proving a patch of allowing players to play offline. It's shameful. Back to this, a perfect touring game, a bad game, a terrible racing game. There are too many I can criticise about this game: terrible car selection in the menu, terrible handling and driving feedback, lacking of vehicle trade or hiding, and the worst is demolition derby. However there are many good about this game as well: large map and beautiful landscape, nice weather system and the best is the diversity of vehicles. Overall this game deserves a thumb up, Ubisoft is not. Now I think it's time to bring Vivendi back and put some pressure to Ubi."
174756640,english,0,646910,You can tell they are desperate after the recent news of the company stock prices tanking and shareholders wanting the head of the CEO on a plate.

Hopefully EA is next.
185513503,english,1,646910,"It's your classic Ubisoft title with a little bit of everything, good and bad.  Right from the start it is wise for you to test a couple of races and then going straight to the settings and try what suits you best. I mention this right from the start because a single setting, like ""linearity"" can make or break the game for you. My first couple races I was already regretting buying this because it didn't played quite like anything else (Forza, Need for Speed, GRID, Project CARS, etc). After changing some settings, I only stopped when I reached the Big Finale race.   Now, do you like recent Assassin's Creed titles with a lot of activities on the map?  If you do, you'll love the map in The Crew 2 since there's a lot going on. Just to give you an example, after unlocking some news cars for new racing categories I had a notification mentioning that I have 40 new activities. In one time I had more than 100 activities unlocked. Yep. If you do not like this or do not care, not to worry you can fast travel from one event to another right after completing them without having to look at the map. That was what I did.   However, none of them are mandatory in order for you to progress (aside of the races themselves, I mean). In order for you to get the big Finale and in order for you to beat the ""boss"" in each category you have to finish at least 50% of the events in each category. While I do enjoy playing all the game has to offer, I was glad this time around to only have a 50% completion requirement because some categories not only are not my thing, at all, it can become a bit frustrating. I'm talking about hovercraft races where you need to reset your brain and adapt to the different behaviour of these vehicles and airplane races as well. The final segment of each category requires you to mix some different categories in a single race so practice and play a bit with everything just to prepare for said races because you need to be at 1st place to win and since it's one race (with 3 or 4 different segments/categories) if you mess one in the end and get 2nd place you'll need to retry these.   Aside of these different categories that may or may not be to your liking there's a decent variety or vehicles to choose from and level them up as well plenty of non-racing side activities such photos, speeding on radar roads and so on, as seen on games like Forza Horizon. Performance wise I did not have a single issue with the performance, always rocking a solid 60 FPS at 1080p or 1440p without demanding too much of my PC. I had one single crash and two odd bugs where the game put me in my desktop and then back to the game, but, because the game did not pause, I lost the races and had to retry.  The community still seems active with 1k-2k current players but this might change when the games gets (hopefully) updated for it to work fully offline. In the end, there's a lot of racing to be had and the variety in racing is great if you want more than ""classic"" racing. If you do not enjoy boat racing or moto cross or offroad The Crew 2 still offers a good value to be played in the long term and visualy still hold up quite nicely with different scenarios to race on as well with different weather races (snow, rain, fog, dusty, etc)."
174861574,english,0,646910,"I hate Uplay  Decided to refund even if its ₹50 I think this game doesn't deserve my money as the game has very poor drifting mechanism. This is game is purely racing oriented still it lack this very basic thing. Even GTA5 has best car driving mechanism. I can drift so damn smoothly in GTA5. I have played car racing games before and this game is exceptional which uses no RT, DLSS and locked to 60 FPS. Its a racing game not a fighting game."
175005626,english,1,646910,"Middle thumb really, its not bad, but not great either. Graphics weirdly dont look as good as the screenshots, i cant figure out why as i have the game on the highest graphics settings. It does have some nice cars in it, Including all the modern day Lotus cars which was nice to see, however, physics feel okay i guess, nothing special. Impressive size map, and has some really interesting places in it. Story? why bother, If i wanted a story I would read a book from a bestselling author. Gameplay is what I come here for and rate a game on. Overall, I think Forza Horizon series is better, but this is a fair entry to this genre. I've uninstalled it after an hour or 2, just plenty better else about that warrant my time more. Got it for 80p so i guess it even broke even on the £1 an hour i set as valuer for money  haha."

176494425,english,0,646910,"[h1]Was it worth buying this game at a huge discount?[/h1]  The Crew 2 is a sequel to the 2014 racing game. It is, of course, a racing game in which we race mainly with bots, and it's better not to comment on the online mode, because it's not done well, so we either race with bots or with friends in a party. Everything is garnished with a boring storyline, about which there is nothing to write too much, because this is a racing game and it is not very important in it. What sets The Crew 2 apart from other racing games is that in addition to classic cars, we also race other vehicles such as airplanes, boats and monster trucks.  [h1]Cars and game modes[/h1]  Let's start, perhaps, with just a large selection of different vehicles. As I mentioned in the game, I have a choice of ordinary cars, racing cars, cars for Drag Race, various types of aircraft, boats. All this results in a large number of game modes, where, of course, most consist of beating opponents in a race. However, there are also time trials or demolition derby. On top of that, there are all sorts of tests on the map, which require us to exceed a certain speed or escape to a certain distance. Plus taking pictures, which may not be something particularly interesting, but it's always some additional activity.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1]  However, the problem arises in the gameplay itself. [b]In The Crew 2 it is impossible to lose.[/b] To win a race you just have to drive ahead and not hit the wall, that's all it takes to always arrive in first place or at least in TOP3 (which already gives us finishing the race and counting it towards progression) This makes the game trivial and doesn't challenge us at all, the bots can't beat us if we don't do very big stupid things like driving into buildings at full speed. This game is not a simulator, but it is too simple. On the other hand, we have, for example, flying an airplane, where the very feeling of flying is much more difficult, and sometimes even annoying, but it poses some challenge. This shows that it was possible to create a more difficult game. In general, the feeling of driving depending on the vehicle and game mode is different, but it is no problem to beat every race the first time. The game also lacks proper vehicle physics. For example, in another racing game, Grid 2, after hitting a wall, we were often unable to drive further because our vehicle was useless. And in The Crew 2? We drive on as if nothing ever happened, the car runs and drives even after driving into a wall 300 km/h.  It should also be noted that in The Crew 2 we upgrade our car with parts we get after completing a race. Initially, this may seem like an interesting game mechanic, but when combined with the hopeless AI that we are able to beat without developing the car, it becomes meaningless. Even a minimal vehicle upgrade makes the game even simpler, and the bots are unable to catch up with us.  [h1]Graphics and map[/h1]  The map in The Crew 2 is sizable, but it is not particularly interesting. There are places that look nice and interesting, but it doesn't encourage you to explore and drive from race to race. This also goes for the graphics, which are so-so. Cars and areas outside the city are even nicely done, but already in the city it looks at least poor, the buildings are ugly and there is no pleasure in driving around the city. Again, effects such as water and weather effects are really well done. I'll point out right away that the sound design of the cars is good, and the music itself is so-so, rather nothing special, but nothing annoying either.  It is also worth noting that there is an option to create your own paintings, or use the paintings of other users. This is only a cosmetic element, but I think it's worth mentioning, because we are not limited by a few basic paint schemes.  And why do random animals pop up in random places on the map, which simply run in front of our hood and we can't even interact with them?  [h1]Summary[/h1]  The Crew 2 is a game I enjoyed playing at the beginning, when I still didn't quite know what I would encounter later. The longer one plays this title the more one sees all the shortcomings. This game is simply too simple and doesn't offer any challenge, and everything is wrapped up with poor gameplay, lack of vehicle physics, empty grimy world, trivial races, stupid AI. Is it worth buying this game at full price? Of course not. And was it worth buying it at a discount of -98%? Also no, because this game is not worth any money. [b] ✔️A large and diverse selection of vehicles ✔️Quite a few game modes and activities ✔️Challenging aircraft driving model ✔️Ability to create custom paint schemes for vehicles  ✔️❌Graphics (cars, out-of-town areas, weather effects - a plus, cities look awful) ✔️❌Sound - sound effects okay, music so-so  ❌Driving model is trivial ❌Stupid AI that is unable to win against us ❌Driving physics is non-existent ❌Empty map that you don't want to drive on ❌Very limited multiplayer mode ❌Pointless car upgrades that make it even easier to win races (even though it's trivial anyway)  [b][u]Rating: 4/10[/u][/b]  ●▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●  [h1][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34408584/]Follow my curator for more reviews[/url][/h1] ●▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬● [b] ATTENTION!

175473060,english,0,646910,"Update: I refunded this game—not because I needed my $4 back, but out of sheer frustration. Ubisoft doesn’t deserve it for what felt like an unnecessarily painful experience.  I grabbed The Crew 2 for a dollar, thinking it would be a fun, low-stakes game to enjoy with my kids. Expectations were low because, well, $1. But even with the bar set that low, this game somehow managed to underdeliver. What we thought would be a quick, fun multiplayer session turned into a confusing, frustrating mess that left us baffled.  Here’s the thing—we never even got to the multiplayer. Between the absurdly confusing menus and being forced through tutorial missions that drag on and on, we couldn’t even figure out how to set up a basic multiplayer session. It makes no sense. After nearly an hour of trying to navigate through the cluttered, poorly designed menus, we gave up. And believe me, I’ve had waterboarding training that was less torture than this.  Ubisoft still has the audacity to charge $49.99 for this game. That's $50 for a product that can’t even guide players through its most basic functions. They even have the nerve to offer Special and Gold editions at $59.99 and $89.99, but I can't for the life of me figure out what you're actually paying for with those.  The driving mechanics are another headache. The cars handle like oversized bouncy balls, with physics that are laughably bad for a driving game. Every attempt to enjoy the driving experience feels like a fight with the controls. To add insult to injury, there’s a 60 FPS lock, which feels outdated and unnecessary, especially when better performance is standard in so many other games.  And then there’s the world itself. It’s big, sure—but it’s empty, bland, and devoid of any meaningful interaction. Ubisoft built a massive map but forgot to fill it with anything interesting or engaging. It feels like a missed opportunity on every level.  The worst part is, this game pushes microtransactions like they’re doing you a favor. Even after charging $50, they still try to squeeze more money out of players. If you want to progress faster or get better vehicles, guess what? You’re expected to pay more. It’s clearly designed to milk every penny out of players rather than delivering a solid experience upfront.  In the end, this game feels unfinished and outdated. Ubisoft should be embarrassed to still sell this at full price. I’m writing this not for me—I’ve already refunded it—but as a warning to anyone thinking of buying it. Save your money and your time, even if it’s on sale for $1.  There’s no justifying the current price tag, and Ubisoft should seriously reconsider what they’re asking people to pay for this incomplete experience."

177946392,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 to me is a deeply flawed but still a very fun game, with the highs being so high to the extant i considered ranking it among my favorite 3 racing games of all times, that was back when i was just starting out, my opinion kept slowly souring the more i played it, but not enough to make me not consider it still as a [b]good[/b] game.  Unfortunately, those highs i just mentioned also come with some very deep lows, the lows that snap you into reality & remind you that this is a Ubisoft game after all. The good news is, despite all those flaws it is still very much fun! and is worth it just for the amount of content it has alone, you like classic/hyper cars? motorcycles? perhaps you're here for some rally racing & off-roading instead? how about some boat racing & hovercrafts? planes? no? then surely you like monster trucks! not even that? okay, i know what you can't say no to, demolition derbies!  My point is, there is pretty much something for everyone here, and most of it seem to be pretty well made from what i experienced so far. (Yes, 225h in and i only finished like 60% of all the content)  i'm not sure on how i want to go on with this review, so i suppose i'll just mention some pros & cons.  The good: + The graphics are pretty good for a 6 years old game, except for the NPCs, we don't talk about those. + A huge selection of cars & vehicles from various time periods, you're sure to find something you'll enjoy, the handling was alright for the most part, and most vehicles felt different enough to drive to warrant switching things up from time to time. + A huge map full of all sorts of races and activities, you'll either love it or hate it, there are like a billion icons on the map for you to clear up, typical Ubisoft stuff, you won't unlock it all at once though. (it was a bit too much for me tbh, especially the billion skills & photos, but it's still content for those who care ig?) + Some key bindings felt weird on planes & boats but thankfully everything was very customizable with various sliders for everything you could possibly want to adjust, very extensive vehicle tuning too! + They also added a few unique fun events in almost all disciplines, with special aesthetics & unique soundtracks, some even form their own mini-stories/events, they're a bit on the shorter side though. + When playing with friends, as long as one of you wins everyone gets the same rewards, big +++ + The game ran almost perfectly for me with rare dips here and there, nothing game-breaking though, i also only experienced 2-3 crashes so far (from what i recall anyways).  The Bad: - Cars are way too expensive imo, it felt so jarring coming from Forza Horizon 4 to this, depending on how much you play you could end up spending days saving for a single vehicle, i really hate that & it's one of my biggest gripes with TC2, as i'm someone who likes to experiment with different cars instead of directly buying the meta thing and never looking back. (For context, i'm 225h in and i only have 147 out of 626 vehicles) - No real character creator, you also can't change your avatar once you pick it up so you better choose well! - The servers will randomly disconnect & kick you out without saving your progress, it didn't happen all the time but still enough to be pretty irritating. - Although almost everything can be played with friends, some of the coolest & most unique races are solo only, especially the ones where you switch vehicles mid-race, shame.. - The UI is needlessly complicated & annoying, with multiple hidden sub-menus, want to upgrade your loot? haha, good luck figuring it out when you're just starting out. - The game loves to waste your time, every single aspect of it is built around wasting as much of your time as possible, want to play a race? drive/fast travel to it, waste 15 seconds for it to start, waste another 15 seconds going to your spot! now there is a chance you'll be slapped with an un-skippable cutscene depending on the race/event, waste even more seconds waiting for the game to start the countdown, in a game with countless races, and where you're forced to endlessly grind for cars & parts this can easily accumulate to hours or more! Want to check the summit? okay, how about we fast travel you to one of the hubs instead in front of a big monitor, now press enter, wait some more, you're still not in, pick the current summit, press enter again, now you can check the summit, you're welcome! (there are many other examples but i digress) - Gold sets, ah.. where should i even start with this one?, let's say you played enough PVE, and now you want to experience the PVP, let's say you actually want to be competitive & even win sometimes, or maybe you just want to beat some of the PVE races on the hardest difficulty but can't, what you need is gold sets, sets that are pretty much obligatory to even have a chance at end-game content (mainly the Summit), one of those sets doubles your nitro, another doubles your score, not a 1-10% meaningless bonus; double!! Now to get a single set for a singular discipline you'll have to spend 3-8h farming the same type of races on the highest difficulty over & over & over, you're not guaranteed gold pieces ofc, and you could be stuck for hours farming for the last piece you need, now imagine having to do it for 16 different disciplines, endless hours of mindlessly replaying the same 2-3min races over and over until you go insane, okay, it took me 80-90h to finally get all the sets i need but at least the nightmare is finally over, right? Get the duck out of here scrub, what are we? reasonable people? ofc not. Each of the golden parts have 2 other random attributes, want the good ones? you'll have to use in-game currencies to reroll them and hope for the best, the price will go higher each time ofc, you could spend 100k or +10 millions to get the attributes you want, feeling lucky? aight aight you finally did it, you got the attributes you want, but wait! there is moreee! each attribute have a % attached to it, you only got 1% out of 20%, time to spend endless time & currency grinding & trying to max it out! Woohoo!! You don't have to do any of this ofc, but that means you'll never be able to get any the of the exclusive Summit cars, almost no vanities (which are normally only buyable using real cash atm, but you get some once in a while in Summits provided you rank high enough), your choice!😄 - You think that was tedious enough? wait till you try stories! they're some unique events(?) with some cool rewards like more exclusive cars & vanities, they basically tell a little story, provide you with a photo & a small description and then ask you to find the location in the photo in the huge US map, then you have to drive to it using a specific type of vehicle (mostly ground vehicles), but you can't fast travel cuz that would make things simple, no no, you'll have to drive! fair enough, found it, it's 75KM away!! woah! alright, i'll spend 15 mins or however long it'll take me to get there, done, checks next step, 95KM away, what the duck? aight, another 10-15mins it is, the 4th location, 45km away, oof, how many more steps i need to finish? what's that? 12 total for a single car story? +1-1.5h if you check YT & 2-3h if you try to do it yourself? how many stories are there? +20? ah, alright, do you get any special narration after each step? a mini cutscene maybe? no? nothing? how about some currency, let's say 1 currency, no? fuck off then..  I just noticed i'm running out of space so this will have to do for now, sorry folks, blame steam.  All in all, even with all the terrible parts of TC2 i'd still consider it to be good, one of the better racing games out there, it's 100% worth a try but DO NOT waste your time excessively grinding for anything as it's not worth it in the slightest, just focus on the parts you enjoy & then move on and never look back. 7/10 (but i'm kinda biased since i only paid 0.8$ for it, so maybe a 6? idk)"

I would be grateful if some multiplayer features, like playing with your friends, remained intact when Ubisoft decides to shut the official servers down.

The AI can be frustrating at times, and traffic physics are a bit wonky. It’s not a hardcore sim, but the handling is enjoyable once you get used to it. After a while, some races feel recycled. Progression can be slow if you’re not into grinding.  If you want a fun, open-world arcade racer with tons of vehicles and exploration, The Crew 2 is worth it.

It feels like a mobile game port. It then just gives you different vehicle after vehicle. Boats don't have any depth in their handling. Just hold W to win with some boost in between.

After they said we should be [b]""feeling comfortable with not owning our games""[/b], they just pulled the plug on The Crew 1 and REMOVED THE GAME FROM EVERYONE'S LIBRARY WITHOUT REFUND, because they didn't want to make an offline mode for it. This basically made the last drop of trust they have to vanish.  [h2]They're trying to get back some goodwill with the offline mode, but don't you think they changed.[/h2] Ubisoft managed to take every single worst step possible to be in this state, now FOR SOME BIG COINCIDENCE after the CEO firing drama they announced that an offline mode for The Crew 2 (and Motorfest) is in the oven, and slaps a [b]98% OFF[/b] in price for everybody see it, for what looks like, an desperate attempt to make look like they changed (or [url=https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739]in their own words[/url], they [i]""heard our concerns about access to The Crew games""[/i]), just in [b][u]the most convenient of times[/u][/b].

They're [b]DESPERATE[/b] to boost the Motorfest numbers, and if they just shut down the servers for the old game without refunding AGAIN, after hearing all the noise we made, that will basically be the final dot in Ubisoft's history.  This may be nonsense, but let's get real. If the plan was adding an offline mode (wich is not bad) they could simply just work on it in the background and release when is finished. This Ubisoft suit & tie morons just needs every positive coments and sell numbers they can possibly have to show their investors, they just gonna show the sell numbers for The Crew 2 (wich basically f*cking free and will not make a diference in their balance) and everyone happy about an offline mode."

I guess they took the ""MMO"" part to heart and had to pad the entire thing out with boring quests. Even in the short time I played I had various bugs too.  I guess another important factor is how buggy the game is. First of all it straight up crashes if you have more than a couple of other accounts linked to your Ubisoft account. Luckily people in the forums had figured this out because there is no help from Ubisoft and my game was just crashing every single time.  Overall even for a dollar it's not worth it to me.

177642277,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 Review  I first discovered this game back in high school and thought it was very unique at the time, with different mechanics and gameplay. After a few years, the game went on sale, and I finally managed to complete it. Unfortunately, it didn’t meet my expectations.  Pros •	Gameplay stands out from other racing games. The game features a variety of vehicles beyond just cars, such as planes, boats, hovercrafts, motorcycles, and more. Each vehicle has its own unique feel, adding diversity to traditional car-based gameplay. •	Race Modes offer a wide variety to keep things fresh. From stunt challenges where you earn points to police chases where you crash into other cars, there’s a lot of variety to enjoy. •	Map Size is extremely vast, covering almost an entire continent of America, from one city to another. It offers a massive space to explore. •	Graphics are stunning, complete with a dynamic weather system that feels quite realistic. It features impressive rainy weather, sunny skies, tornado storms, snowstorms, and many other conditions that greatly impact the racing experience. •	Arcade-Style Mechanics make it easy for new players to pick up and play without much effort. •	Fast Travel is quick, even without using an SSD.  Cons •	RPG System is puzzling, requiring players to grind in order to upgrade all the vehicles. It’s a terrible idea to include RPG elements in a racing game. •	Currency System is tedious. Earning money requires repeating races multiple times just to earn a small amount, making it frustrating to gather vehicle parts and money. •	Empty World despite the large map, feels lifeless and hollow. Even though there are some living creatures, it doesn’t feel alive. •	Character Control where you walk around seems like a poor fit for a racing game. •	Mission Variety becomes boring and exhausting, with activities like doing stunts and crashing into boxes being especially irritating. •	Vehicle Handling is poor, particularly in rally cars, motorcycles, and some non-car vehicles. •	Cutscenes and Voice Acting are terrible, feeling like mere filler content. •	Storyline is bad enough that it would be better left out entirely. •	Music lacks variety, especially compared to competitors that feature more suitable tracks for driving. •	Playtime is too long and exhausting for a racing game. A duration of 15 to 20 hours would be reasonable, but reaching 35 to 40 hours makes it feel repetitive and tiring. •	Race Track Design is monotonous, with inconsistent turns and many narrow passages that suggest the designers don’t fully understand how race tracks work. •	PC Performance suffers, frequently crashing multiple times, which is very frustrating.  In my opinion, this is the worst racing game I’ve ever played. It’s tiring and boring, mainly due to the grinding required to earn money and vehicle parts. A racing game should provide enjoyment without the pressure of a terrible grinding system. Honestly, this game was a complete waste of my time and money.  Score: 3/10"
174883860,english,0,646910,"This is a free to play mario kart that disguises as a paid racing game.

Ubisoft UAC 3 times again, dualsense being plugged in breaks menu, wheel support is horrible (Im using a Logitech G29), you need to log into uplay if you got it there just to uninstall it (or I just deleted it manually), the launcher asked me to log in, just close it, relaunch the game. Itll do it automatically. Physics are shit for racing but I like driving, even if the lighting is kinda crap and the world is a bit bland.

174985259,english,0,646910,"[h1] STOP DESTROYING GAMES [/h1] European Citizens' Initiative :  Video games have grown into an industry with billions of customers worth hundreds of billions of euros. During this time, a specific business practice in the industry has been slowly emerging that is not only an assault on basic consumer rights but is destroying the medium itself.  An increasing number of publishers are selling video games that are required to connect through the internet to the game publisher, or ""phone home"" to function. While this is not a problem in itself, when support ends for these types of games, very often publishers simply sever the connection necessary for the game to function, proceed to destroy all working copies of the game, and implement extensive measures to prevent the customer from repairing the game in any way.  This practice is effectively robbing customers of their purchases and makes restoration impossible. Besides being an affront on consumer rights, video games themselves are unique creative works. Like film, or music, one cannot be simply substituted with another. By destroying them, it represents a creative loss for everyone involved and erases history in ways not possible in other mediums.  Existing laws and consumer agencies are ill-prepared to protect customers against this practice. The ability for a company to destroy an item it has already sold to the customer long after the fact is not something that normally occurs in other industries. With license agreements required to simply run the game, many existing consumer protections are circumvented. This practice challenges the concept of ownership itself, where the customer is left with nothing after ""buying"" a game.  We wish to invoke Article 17 §1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [EUR-Lex - 12012P/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] – “No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss.” – This practice deprives European citizens of their property by making it so that they lose access to their product an indeterminate/arbitrary amount of time after the point of sale. We wish to see this remedied, at the core of this Initiative.  We also invoke Title XV of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)[EUR-Lex - 12012E/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] and the following TFEU Articles as our justification for and the Union’s imperative to respond to this initiative:  Article 169 – Per §1, the EU has an obligation “to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection…to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers”. We believe this practice infringes upon or requires correction to be commensurate with the EU’s obligation. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with videogames.  Article 12 – “Consumer protection requirements shall be taken into account in defining and implementing other Union policies and activities.” Given that this practice extends across Member States and beyond the EU, the Union’s actions regarding this practice ought to keep consumer protection in mind. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with video games.  Article 114, §3 – “The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection… Within their respective powers, the European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective” This practice undermines the high level of consumer protection that the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council takes as the basis of law in the Union, and their objectives of establishing and maintaining the functioning of an internal market as described in §1 of this Article, and Article 26 TFEU.

174903492,english,0,646910,Bad game. Bad car physics. Bad engine accelerating sounds (literally sounds like a remote control toy car). Bad graphics that don't match trailer/pictures.
165984053,english,0,646910,"In light of the recent events with the crew there is no point buying a mostly single player game only to loose it when Ubisoft decides the multiplayer servers are end of life, if single player could be guaranteed playable after such a date I may recommend, plus £49.99 for a 2018 game is ridiculous."
174859237,english,0,646910,"Even though the game is only one euro, I was really hesitant about whether I wanted to buy it or not. The initial problem was the physics—or, I should say, the lack of it. No, there are even more serious issues plaguing this game.  First and foremost—the Ubish1te launcher. Of the 32 minutes I spent in the game, I spent half of that time in the launcher because of what a mess it is. The launcher even asked for a CD key... yeah, that sounds like a major yikes to me. But that's just the curse of modern gaming in general.  After about 13 minutes, I finally managed to enter the game, and there came another issue. Even with specs well above the recommended, I suffered from stutters and lags, even on the lowest settings. I genuinely believe that the PC requirements listed here on Steam are nothing but misleading. The game's a mess. A frickin' mess.  And then there's the physics. So far, I haven't seen such an awful racing game in terms of driving. To put it into perspective—I managed to finish both TDU games, which are infamous for their questionable driving models. I even played TDU2 yesterday, and I can tell you that The Crew 2 is much worse, as I genuinely had no control over the vehicles. But yeah, the flying is okayish.  This game is nothing but a mess. Even after years of updates, it's still a disaster that only the community can save with offline patches and modifications to fix various issues. Welcome to modern gaming, where the community does the devs' job. Just frickin' perfect."
161895806,english,0,646910,"I used to be able to say ""yes, get this game,"" but now that you've taken it's predecessor offline, I cannot and won't. How long do we have, maybe another 2 to 3 years for this game? Possibly even less because of your focus on the other game? I don't like modern Forza games, but at least they let you play their older games even without an online connection. If you can't even do that for your consumers, then why bother make anymore games?"
84255376,english,0,646910,"This game was once a haven, once a miracle. It was an actually good racing game in the modern era. A rarity. But then The Chase happened. Before The Chase released in November 2020, I played this game almost every single day. I no-lifed it, grinded out every event, car, part, you name it. It was my favorite game. Then The Chase came along and ruined everything. It removed the ways to get the secondary currency (Crew Credits) by doing Daily tasks. Instead, the only way to get this currency now? Pay REAL MONEY. They also added the ""Motorpass"" system which locks a ton of content behind a paywall. These mechanics are horrific and make the game feel like a F2P, but it's a paid game! Absolutely ridiculous. I, along with many players, stopped playing after The Chase released and permanently changed the game for the worse. I finally came back to it a few days ago just for the game to almost explode my GPU because the PC port of this game is absolutely atrocious for optimization and decided ""enough is enough. It's time to let go."" I will be uninstalling the game after posting this review, but before I do let me run down every reason why you should not play this game, or at least be very weary about doing so.  -Optimization. I have a very decent rig, and yet this game THROTTLES my computer. Not to mention the game constantly crashes, and sometimes will lock up your computer for upwards of 20 minutes by doing so. If you still want to play this game after reading this, PLEASE consider playing a console port instead. As I said, this game could very well cause damage to your computer if you don't take caution. The game almost caused my GPU to break before I uninstalled it.  -Monetization. As I said in the first part of this review, The Chase introduced very predatory microtransactions into the the game. They are not forced, but they lock a lot of content behind a paywall and try to bait you into buying it. Very scummy.  -Repetition/Bland single player experience. The single player experience gets very repetitive and boring. The game has a very obvious bias to Street Racer events. There are 50 different Street Race events in the game. For perspective, no other class in the game breaks 20 unique events. Most classes don't break *10*. The game advertises itself as having tons of different vehicles and event types, but really it only focuses on Street Race. This applies to updates too, as 90% of the new events and cars that get added are Street Race or Hypercar class. On top of all of this, the singleplayer ai is ridiculously easy. The ""Races"" are more or less time trials with ai. Do not expect a challenging and enthralling singleplayer experience.  -Lack of understanding between devs and players. The devs do NOT listen to the feedback of the players, they just do as they please. The community went up in flames after The Chase, but the devs issued one statement that boiled down to ""we don't care, keep whining"". They do not listen. They do not care. The playerbase means nothing to them besides a means to make money. Do not expect the devs to do the right thing.  -Lack of variety. For a game that advertises itself for being diverse and varied, it sure isn't. The basegame gave us some variety sure, but all the content updates add the most generic and boring cars possible. Not to mention that other vehicle types such as boats, planes, bikes, etc NEVER get new content. They might add a new bike once every few months, but you will never see new boats or planes or other vehicles. And yet they will add pointless reskins of existing cars that nobody asked for all day long... They very obviously only care about adding the most predictable and uninteresting vehicles possible, so don't let the promise of variety fool you. You could easily get a similar car list out of other franchises.  -Boring events. This goes back to the boring and repetitive nature of the game, but most of the events are very boring and uninteresting layouts. There's a few good ones, but most of the tracks are extremely simple and easy. Very few sharp turns or hairpins, no traffic in races, overly long and tedious, etc. The ai will not pose a threat, and the track layouts will bore you to death after you play for a while.  -Empty and bland map. Lots of copy/paste in the map, lots of stretches of empty road, lots of areas lacking detail and feeling soullessly void of life, lots of extremely condensed towns and cities, it just feels like a very cheap map and is actually a downgrade from The Crew's map. No joke, look it up on YouTube. They downgraded the map bewteen games and it shows. A lot.  I had positive things to say about this game some months back, but all of my good will and love for the game has evaporated. I will still list some of the good things this game does however, just to be fair.  -Livery Editor. It has a good livery editor. I made plenty of detailed skins in my time playing the game. It's not the best, but it's pretty good. You can easily make good stuff with it and it's fairly limitless.  -Decent physics. They aren't phenominal and they certainly have their bad moments, but overall the physics are pretty light and fun. Rallycross cars especially are fun to just take on some dirt roads and rip it up with.  -Playability. You can't blow through the entire game in a few days, it does keep you coming back to play more. Money rewards are fairly low to make you work for what you want. The issue being that it takes that to an extreme and ends up becoming a bit tedious and boring. It has enough to keep you coming back, but maybe a bit too much.  Would I reccomend this game? No. Not anymore. I would and have reccomended the game to many people and friends since it came out in 2018, but after the last few months of the game's life I cannot support it anymore. Things started falling off in Summer 2020, but The Chase in Nov 2020 sealed it's fate. No longer can I enjoy this game, or advise others to play it. If you *still* want to play it, please do not play the PC version. You will regret it. Buy a console port, like PS4 or Xbox. They are far more stable (but still have issues. I played on PS4 and still had the game crash). I would seriously advise you to save your money, or maybe watch the updates for a few months in hopes that the studio gets their act together and brings the game back to it's glory days of 2019. I hope this review helps at least one person understand that this game is not what it once was, and that their money is better spent elsewhere.  TLDR: The game used to be really good but from Summer 2020 until now it has gotten progressively worse to the point where it's no longer worth playing. Buy something else or wait a few months to see if they fix the game with update, but  don't hold your breath."

43146875,english,0,646910,"PREFACE: If you're wondering why I already have this many hours even though the game just launched hours ago, it is because I purchased the Ultimate Edition, and was able to play 3 days early via Early Access. Also, I put in over 200 hours into the first game of the series on Xbox One, and put in about 20+ hours into Beta for this game. I skipped through everything I was able to do in the Beta, and grinded my way up to Icon, so that I felt I had enough experience to make this review.  GAMEPLAY: This is where this game shines. I thoroughly enjoy the driving in this game. I came into it expecting to hate the boats/airplanes, and thought about ignoring them altogether, but instead I fell in love with them. I refuse to fast travel (except for the parts that I completed in the Beta), but now I find myself boating and/or flying to almost every race. The most important mechanic is the driving, and that feels great. Every vehicle in the game appears to drive differently, and have a unique weight that gives a great feeling to driving.   One of the biggest complaints of the Beta was how you could grind the rails and not lose any speed whatsoever, but Ubi has seemed to fix that at this point. Being in a vehicle is fun in this game, and that is important, considering that this is a racing game. Rubberbanding is a huge issue though, and detracts from the races themselves. The first title thrived on cross-country races, but what's the point of a 40 minute race, if only the last minute is all that matters? This needs to be sorted out. It almost encourages you to sit behind first place and conserve your nitrous until the last second.  The thing that can make gameplay SO aggravating is the GPS. They completely removed the arrows that you used to be able to follow on top of the screen. Now all you get is the tiny GPS off to the bottom right corner of the screen, and sometimes it can be impossible to follow, especially at extremely fast speeds. Unfortunately, that is not the only problem with the GPS. Half the time it doesn't even work, and just gives you a straight line to the location, and you have no idea how to get where you are going, so opt to fly there.  STORY/CHARACTERS: There is no story. A lot of people thought the story from the first game was quite boring, but was this really the solution for that? The characters serve no purpose, and bring no attachment to who they are. Right now this game is a single-player grind fest. Also, I don't know who did the animations for the characters in the game, but it looks like they hired the BioWare B-Team that did Mass Effect Andromeda. It's bad.  MULTIPLAYER: It is nonexistent. You can hook up with friends and drive around, but that is the ONLY form of multiplayer in the game, besides leaderboards for races. The fact that this game launched without PvP is an insult to the consumer. How can a game possibly be sold as an MMO-lite racer with no PvP? Right now the grind is for nothing, and we have no solid launch date for PvP. If you are looking to do online races, then do not purchase this game yet.  VISUALS: This game is beautiful. But only certain aspects. They nailed the two most important parts of racers, and that is the cars and lighting. The cars look absolutely stunning, and is a huge leap in the right direction for the series, even more than the last game's Wild Run expansion. Ironically, I also noted lighting as looking good. And that's true.....partially. The god rays in this game are among the best I've seen in a vanilla game. The lighting of the sky always captures the mood, and is generally quite gorgeous. Where does the lighting fail? In the headlights. It is IMPOSSIBLE to see in the dark, unless you are in a lit city. The distance of your headlights is a problem the community has raised since the Alpha state, but nothing appears to have been fixed in that area.  The landscapes are quite pretty, but what ruins it are the popins. Yes I have a GTX 1060, but look at any review. This is a problem across all platforms, even for people with 1080 TIs. Ubi has addressed this, saying that it had something to do with the draw distance forced by allowing planes in the game, but in truth, this does nothing but prove that Ubi is acknowledging that their game is not fully optimized, even though it is now launch day. I think it's pretty unacceptable to have a 1080 TI not be able to handle the popins, even when at 1080p.  The water is gorgeous, and is one of the saving graces for the environment. One of the reasons I travel by boat so much in this game is because the water is pretty, unique, fun, and doesn't have all the foliage popins.   The worst part about the graphics in this game are the buildings. They look like Legos, like something out of a game that came in the previous decade. It's so weird having a game that looks so beautiful in some aspects, but absolutely abysmal in others.  AUDIO: The audio in this game has caused a bunch problems for me. The amount of bugs is crazy. Half the time you will hear a car coming up right behind you, only to look behind you and see no one. Also if you crash into objects in the world, there is a bug that repeats the crashing sound on end until you pause the game.   The voice acting is pretty unfortunate. A lot of voices didn't match their faces/animations, and it sounds like Ubi just picked up random people off the street, used a subpar mic, and gave them really bad and cheezy lines to say.  The cars do sound nice, and especially the backfiring of cars can be really satisfying.  The music within the game's radiostations are also much more satisfying than the original game's.  ECONOMY: This game's economy has been VERY inconsistent from the start. Many cars didn't match each other in terms of price, and although they have addressed this slightly, the problem still rings true.  So, is the game P2W? Yeah. It definitely is. Right now, you can purchase a 2nd form of currency, and buy any car you want. I'm not saying microtransactions are the worst thing in the world, but when they are taken further than just cosmetics, I tend to have a problem with it. Right now you can spend extra cash, and compete on the leaderboards with any car in the game from the get-go. Imagine if PvP was actually in this game? Ubi is practically encouraging players to spend money to get everything from the start, and discouraging them from actually even playing the game at all.  VALUE: I'd say it would take the average player about 20 hours to get Icon, and unlock mostly everything in the game. You can get more time of course by grinding out the Icon ranks and such, but I would only see players doing this in prepping for PvP. By using the Dollar per Hour scale, that costs the average consumer about $3 per hour. That's not terrible value, but if this game launched without missing content, you would get much more value per dollar. At least most won't get the Ultimate edition like I did and decrease the value even more.  FINAL THOUGHTS: The Crew launched as a an absolute mess. I don't think that anyone will say otherwise, even Ubisoft. It showed by how much effort they put into resurrecting that game from the dead. They updated the graphics, and also put out two of the best expansions in recent video game history besides the Witcher 3. To me, The Crew launched at about a 4/10. That's how much of a mess that game was. After Ubisoft fixed it, they got it to about an 8.5 in my books. I picked it up for free on Games with Gold, and it quickly became my favorite racing game after all of the expansions. And yes, this is coming from a Forza fanboy. The Crew had a slow start, but eventually gave itself a solid foundation for a sequel. Unfortunately what we got was a game with much better mechanics, yet stripped of all of it's basic content. It is with a heavy heart that I have to give such a bad review of my most anticipated game of the year, that's not named Smash Bros. Ultimate.  VERDICT: 6.5/10  TL;DR: Don't buy yet."
174689773,english,1,646910,"I have a feeling that this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car, and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies. Still worth the price tho, beautiful graphics and racists"
83579628,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is a whisker away from being a great game. You can spend an entire afternoon just enjoying the cars and driving without a specific purpose, while taking in some of the marvelous views, and it feels really good. However, the major downsides - ubiquitous copy-pasting and a rather scant number of genuine innovations  - don't allow me to recommend this game to absolutely everyone -  not just yet.  ⭐⭐⭐✰✰"
153623491,english,0,646910,"Just as a disclaimer, the Crew series is actually not bad, but for anyone who hasn’t noticed this yet, yesterday Ubisoft spontaneously delisted The Crew 1 and also announced that the game will be shutdowned and unplayable after March ’24. Sorry, this is absolutely inexcusable. They tried this with their DLCs last year (but rowed back due to the sh**storm), yet seriously, now this again??!! Don’t get me wrong, The Crew 1 is actually a great game which has quite some single player story content, obviously even an offline mode is integrated hidden in the files (due to some programmers in the community who are working on a mod, see the forum discussions), so there’s obviously no real reason to not give us customers (who paid for all those expensive season passes and DLCs) an offline function. Ubisoft really needs to stop their extremely toxic anti-consumer behavior, because meanwhile even I (I always defended them in the past) am losing interest in their products. And another joke, if you want to complain at the moment, there’s even no official Ubisoft internet forum anymore, only one on Discord (where all discussions get lost anyway). Uggh, sorry, this just had to get out, it’s just super frustrating.   And regarding The Crew 2, yeah, if we tolerate this behavior, The Crew 2 will go the same way, as will probably go a lot of other Ubisoft games with multiplayer online integration."
174895903,english,1,646910,"Alright. [i]The Crew 2[/i]. Judging from the current all-time high concurrent peak player counts for the game, I'd say a lot of people are aware of this game currently being priced at one dollar (and less in some regions). And a lot of people have bought the game as a result of this stunning deal. Including myself. Just to get it out of the way, if you have something to say about The Crew 1's removal, go to the game forum. I'm not interested in the topic as part of this review. So...  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984820  I am confident I would never have bought this game had it not been a buck, and I'm also confident that a lot of people have the same opinion. But since it was a buck, I did in fact buy it, and I'm glad I did. It's hella fun. The gameplay loop of joining events and races, using the cash you earn to buy new vehicles and such, and upgrading your vehicles with loot rewards from events and races, is pretty simple. But it is also effective. As you progress, you will unlock more events and races, and because they are located across the lower 48 States, you get a wide variety of settings for everything. From cities to mountains to forests to lakes to deserts to meteor craters to rain to snow to beaches and on and on, there is a vast array of different types of courses and tracks to enjoy. And there are a wide variety of types of races and events as well. From standard track races to boat races to plane aerobatics to demolition derbies, and so on.  The sheer volume of content is quite impressive. And, the various vehicles, be they cars or trucks or bikes or planes or boats or dune buggies or whatever...they all handle nicely and feel good to drive in. Each of these is upgradeable in many ways, which will increase their performance, handling, speed, and just generally make them function better and better as you progress.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984770  There is a campaign of sorts, where you try to become the lead racer in a few different styles, but it's also easy enough to ignore that in favor of simply racing around, upgrading your vehicles, wandering around your crib, and simply free roaming. And free roaming is a lot of fun in and of itself. Mostly, it's a huge sightseeing trip, where you can also try to beat other player's records with jumps, speed, and so on; that you come across while driving around. And setting some records of your own for other people to beat. And there is a decent photography mini game all across the States where you will take pictures of animals, special vehicles and such to gain more cash and follower.  And gaining followers is really the sub goal that most impacts your playthrough. The number of followers you have determines how popular your racer is, which in turn unlocks new vehicle options and race/event options. Just about everything you do will earn you new followers (and cash).  Also, you can play with other players and even if you're not, you will see them all over the map. At this moment in time (the time of this review being written), no matter where you are, somebody else is nearby. And there are a lot of player created activities as well. Plus, you can co-op with friends if you get bored of solo play. So really, the content just keeps expanding as you explore what the game has to offer.  Visually, the game looks great. It has a 60 FPS cap, which isn't anything to brag about, but somehow, the devs have made the most out of that limitation and made a game that has a never-ending supply of screenshot moments. The audio is also well done. The songs themselves are very cool. The dialogue is basically all ""hey bro"" Extreme Games fodder, but it's fun and definitely appropriate.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3330111663  You will need Ubisoft Connect to play this. I don't care at all about that, but you might. And some people are having an issue with the game crashing if they have other non-Steam clients linked to their Ubi account. I have not had that issue personally and have it linked to both PSN and Epic as well, but if you do, you will need to unlink everything except Steam and that will resolve the crashing issue apparently. No idea how or why that is what it is or why it only affects some players. It's been a bug free experience for me though with a 3070 and an i5.  Now, should you also buy the season pass? I personally have no intention of doing so. There's no new content, and I don't care about getting a few extra cars and some swag. But the base game, offering what can easily be hundreds and even thousands of hours of content for one dollar. That is something I can definitely get behind. I can't think of a better deal in gaming at this moment. Now, if you miss or skip this one-dollar promotion they have going on right now, value will be more of...you know..., a [i]your mileage may vary[/i] type thing....

174302344,english,1,646910,"Forza Horizon fan.  Having fun in Crew 2 with all the different vehicle and event types.  C2 runs smooth, no bugs, and each event type is well designed and implemented.  Only frustration, I did not reach Platinum division in the Summit my first week. Being rich in Forza means you can buy and tune a competitive vehicle.  In Crew 2, you buy the base vehicle, but you have to grind for upgrade parts.   FH has classes (B, A, S1, S2).  C2 does not.  All vehicles of same type in C2 have same max tune value. FH no Nitro, C2, Nitro is primary factor. C2, no Auction House nor any way to sell vehicles. C2, leaderboards are more integral, and are a focus of endgame/seasons (Summit). I have over 700 vehicles in FH5.  In C2 earning vehicles is a MUCH slower process, and so far, I don't see much incentive to collect cars, beyond appearance and Summit requirements.  Do different Street Race cars handle differently at max stats??  excluding part affixes and awd."
43308733,english,0,646910,"If I had to sum up this game in one word, that word would be ""inconsistent"". The core racing experience is fun, and the open-world is still a thrill to just fly, race and drift around. However, there are definetly some irks that hold it back:  ""That's solid? really?"" - you'll find yourself saying this a fair bit, unfortunately. Whilst bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts and even traffic fold up like they're made of crisps and ping off into space, trees and parked cars are merciless, utterly solid, and occasionally placed exactly where you think you can get that little shortcut.  The AI: Rubberband doesnt even sum the AI up. In fact, it's barely worth trying to drive fast, as they will ALWAYS catch up to you and press their hidden hyperspace buttons the second you overcook a corner. Incredabily frustrating sometimes when you've been in the lead for 95% of the race, then get taken out by a suprise bus on the last corner and finish stone-dead last. Hard mode races up the challenge significantly, but dont be surprised to see the AI disappear over the draw distance within 10 seconds of the start if you havn't grinded out those upgrades for your vehicles.  The Story: If I had to guess, I'd say The Crew 2 was designed to be faaaar more ambitious in it's storytelling. The cutscenes and dialogue you get occasionally before or after a race feel really disjointed, as if there's a big chunk of the story you missed somewhere. One place it particularly confised me was one of the Rival races, where suddenly the mentor who's been urging you on all this time suddenly heel turns so rapidly it's surprising he doesnt do himself an injury, and opens a cutscene by telling your mechanic, Hiro, that you've somehow betrayed him and he wants a race... by doing what he wanted you to and winning races... huh? It just made me confused. Add to this the artsy cutscenes full of pseudo-philosophical commentary that honestly makes zero sense to pop up when they do, and overall the impression that there was a lot of story removed that might have linked these sections together can't be ignored.  There is a lot of good though. The racing is fun, the sensation of speed is excellent, the environments (especially out in the countryside with deserts and the Grand Canyon) are gorgeous and run well, and it really shines when you're just having fun in the open world. Just not in Monster Trucks. Never Monster Trucks. They just... no. horrible.  To sum up, there is a huge amount of potential here. It just needs filling out, and as such in it's present state I can't really recommend it for full price. Maybe after a few updates, it will start to fulfil it's potential. So who made this game again? Oh. Ubisoft. Don't count on the potential being filled then."

184805635,english,0,646910,"I'm drunk, wanna do some racing. The only racing game downloaded on my PC is The Crew 2, played it a bit before, didn't hate it. Ubisoft Connect pops up and tells me all of a sudden the wrong account is connected to the game and now I'm locked out of playing the game I paid (a dollar) for until I talk to a Ubisoft person. I don't wanna talk to a ubisoft person, I'm drunk and I wanna race. Shame ubisoft, shame."
43274957,english,0,646910,"Disgusting rubberbanding makes the game so un-enjoyable. Race perfectly and the ai will be right behind you the entire time even if your vehicle is 50 points faster. Of course it's the same the other way around as well, you can eat shit in a ditch and be right behind the leader of the race 10 seconds later because they basically slow down to a crawl if you fall behind, which is incredible because as soon as you pull ahead of them by 5-6 seconds the ai can start to take perfect turns going twice as fast as you like the car is on rails instead of tires. Even worse is the fact that the game punishes you for using your breaks. It's legitimately faster to ride the side rail of a corner and hold the boost than to bother to slow down and take a proper turn.  PSA: I'm honestly super surprised I actually have to explain this here but to everyone commenting about the problem being connection or cpu or w/e else, rubberbanding ai is not a term for lagging. Rubber band AI refers to a feature of artificial intelligence found in racing titles that is designed to prevent players from getting too far ahead of computer-controlled opponents.   Edit: I'm making a sidenote for all the people who are real grumpy about the bad reviews, the base of the game itself is nice. It feels great to freeroam around the map. The physics could have used a bit more tuning but aside from that the cars control as you would expect from a good arcade racer. The problem lies beyond that in the ai. The oponents can decide to hit warpspeed to catch up to you whenever they damn well please. It's not as obvious in disciplines like hypercar racing and the F1 syle discipline, but street races are absolutely atrocious to play. I honestly believe if Ubi went back and fixed some of their problems the game could be great, but as it is, it feels like a big mess. Also, always online game and no PvP for another 5-6 months is a pathetic joke."
158209813,english,0,646910,"One day ubisoft will shut this game's servers down and it will no longer be playable due to it lacks of offline mode. Do you want proof? Please look at what ubisoft did with The Crew 1. The Crew 1 is no longer playable and ubisoft refuses to release an offline patch for it. Even if The Crew 2 is a good game, I recommend you not to buy until ubisoft release an offline patch and show some respect to players. I don't want this game and crew 1 to disappear into the dark abyss of the online only games. Until ubisoft show some care I give negative review."
50261820,english,0,646910,"I played the game in 4k on a 3080 with an XBOneX Pro controller. All detail was maxed except AA and blur. I do not recommend a keyboard and mouse.  PLEASE NOTE, even though I have left comments on, I am not interested in you telling me that I should put 4000 hours into a game I don't enjoy so I can ""git good"", and then I would like it. That is a stupid argument. Don't be stupid. Skill is not indicative of enjoyment, and I have better things to do than bash my head on what I personally feel are bad / mediocre games on the off chance I could maybe like them one day. I have a life and don't play games to develop Stockholm syndrome.  Neutrals: - There are 25-minute single races. In an arcade racing game. I hated this. You may not.  Pros: - Most of the time, it ran at 60 FPS. - Large map, but...  Cons: - There is little to see on the map that's interesting. Sometimes the trees change type, and maybe there's more water in an area. - The upgrade system is painfully bad and is essentially a lootbox minus a box. You win a race, you get some random upgrades. You can have, say, LVL 65 in every part but one and it may take you 20 races to get an upgrade for that slot. Yes, you can get RNG'd into having to grind races to upgrade. It's as bad as it sounds. - VERY hard to read tracks when racing. Sometimes you'll just go in the wrong direction because you have no clue where you are intended to go. You essentially have to watch the minimap because watching the race itself is useless as the tracks are signposted more poorly than any other racing game I've played in recent memory. - The AI is tuned incredibly poorly. Either they're WAY ahead of you even though you're driving a better car and the race is half your level, or you're absolutely demolishing them. There is no adjusting this. It is infuriating. - All the cars control like they're racing on butter. Everything slides uncontrollably and really shows off how shoddy the physics are in this game. You will constantly careen into stuff. And speaking of... - Hitting damn near anything brings you to a complete stop. You don't slide past stuff like other arcade racing games when the corner of your car clips a bush, you come to a complete halt. You now have to restart the race because you WILL NOT catch up. Is the race 12 minutes long? Too bad. Now to find that race reset... - The menus are awful. I had to actually Google how to restart a race and quit the game. Thought they'd be in the in-game menus? Hah, you simpleton! You have to hit Y to bring up a special menu that hides in the corner of the screen, but only comes up while driving! Want that menu on a keyboard & mouse? NOPE! Those buttons sometimes show up at the bottom of a different menu where you may have expected them in the first place! Well, sometimes. Only when the option for the buttons feels like appearing. Sometimes it just doesn't. - The characters are astoundingly annoying and are written to speak like a Red Bull commercial. The overtly positive ""might as well be saying nothing at all"" style garbage non-speaking flows out of everyone's mouth continually. The story is non-existant. If you love chasing ""followers"" (ugh), then go on Instagram and be vapid there. Even the shell of a life you pretend to have there will be more fun than The Crew 2. - Very odd and frequent framerate drops when physics items interact with each other. This happens often. Adjusting settings did not help. - It looks worse than the original did somehow, and the first was quite an ugly game. - One of the worst game soundtracks I've heard since Gone Home. This low-budget mess of a soundtrack complete with incredibly shrill lady-punk songs. The only good song on the soundtrack is Airbourne - Running Wild, and it's over 10 years old. Yes that's an opinion, and your mileage may vary. - I am an idiot and preordered the Gold Edition because, hey, this is a sequel. It's going to improve on the original in many ways. (Narrator: ""It did not."") They didn't listen to a single damn complaint about the original, even though nearly every review both professional and amateur said the same things (Many of which are pointed out in my review here). This makes me madder. You couldn't even be bothered to fix the obvious? Bad form, Ubisoft. - They haven't improved on any of these complaints since launch and instead insist on putting out boring Live Events. This is because Live games make more money (See Destiny). Make no mistake, this is a product, not art and it definitely wants all of your money. - I genuinely tried to like it and power through some of the issues, but I just can't any more. I hate this game. It is one of the worst racing games I have played in recent memory. Even the two most recent Need For Speed games were better, and they were mediocre at the best of times.  UPDATE: Tried it again several years down the road. Holy god there is so much seasonal crap slathered everywhere, and random things to level that they're trying to sell you it was nearly impossible to figure out what to do next. This somehow got even grosser than it was. Oh, and even though the menus have changed, they now make LESS sense due to the sheer amount of layered-on garbage that, AND I still couldn't find a way to quit. I had to Alt + F4."
43211268,english,0,646910,"This game is an improvement over the first one which I defended to be honest. The addition of planes and boats was a great one.  However, I won't give this game a postiive review because Ubisoft intentionally downgraded the game. By that I speak of landmarks. Of all the landmarks they had in The Crew 1, they were all very accurate in terms of shape and relative location. They even had the same ones in the E3 demo. But they decided to remove a lot of them or make them inaccurate for no good reason. If it is a technical reason, it is pure lazyness on the devs part and they jusst used a cheap dirty workaround to fix an issue they had.  I am quite disappointed with the map downgrades. I feel that rather than removing the landmarks, they should have created accurate new ones to further enhance the cities. I will admit the random buildings do look better in this game but the lack of landmarks irritates me.    -In New York the Metlife building, Yankee Stadium, Chrysler Building etc were removed, and the Empire State building was replaced with an inaccurate model. -In Detroit the bridge crossing over to Candida was removed. -In Los Angeles, the City Bank building was altered and is no longer accurate. -The military base north of Chicago was removed. -Downgrades made which decrease the detail to the Hoover Dam  Now Chicago, my home town, got hit hard by the pointless downgrading. About 70 percent of the landmarks were removed. -Sears Tower was removed (Even non Chicago natives will notice this one. Bad decision. Makes me wonder what is wrong with the dev/designer who thought that was a good idea.) -Thompson Center was removed -LaSalle Street Metra was station removed -United Center is gone -Solder Field is gone -The Diamond Building is also gone -The airport was removed (REALLY BAD choice giving the fact the game now has airplanes) -The accurate recreation of Navy Pier was replaced by a bunch of the random filler buildings and props you see all over the map. They are munched together like some kid would make if the game had some kind of map editor which let you place buildings. -The curved building where the river forks was removed. (Forgot the name) -Skyscraper directly south of Sears Tower removed (Also forgot the name) -The Chase Bank building is gone.   What makes me mad is that it is the same map as the first game. You will get a better US road trip experiance in The Crew 1 as the cities featured actually look like the way they are supposed to. They intentionally downgraded it. This game has good gameplay, but screwing up the map makes me belive this game is incomplete and therefore doesn't get a positive review. I'll change my review when Ubisoft restores the content they removed intentionally.

50314368,english,0,646910,"Crew 2 was controversial at start and ran out of content in 3 months, lost its playerbase in 5 months, Season Pass has been nothing but a scam. About year after launch, big update comes with three new cars (wow!) and MICROTRANSACTIONS (they are only cosmetic and premium currency can be obtained in some ways but donating is much easier). It's Ubisoft, remember, no fun allowed. Even the first Crew had a better potential of holding playerbase with different bodykits to all cars and good crate system even considering the fact that it wasn't at release. Honestly, whole economic system in Crew 2 is messed up, money are really hard to get and best cars cost horribly high, even though $1,4kk car can show similar or even worse performanse than $350k due to ""pro settings"" and parts which you can switch between cars of the same class and which define the most of car's stats, all you're buying is basically a skin with some advantages (base stats are slightly different nonetheless). Open-world activities are ok, but not profitable, and not all races are profitable as well. There are a lot of them, and developers even add some every now and then, but the main problem is that you are granted with no rewards by completing certain percentage of all races in one class, so there is no point completing all of them - you only get vehicle reward after you beat any story boss, but all you get is mediocre car and trash helicopter which you can't even use in a race. It's easier to find a good relaxing race and farm money there 'till you faint and it seems that it's what most players do. I can't feel a soul in Crew 2. Making matters worse, it's just fucking tedious and grind-based mediocre car game. This vomitous scheme ""Grind money to get a better car to grind more money using it"". No immersion effect (as in FH4), bad car handling and collision physics, terrible optimisation with painful launches and many, many other bad things. It's year after, not the release date state. When hearing news about Ubisoft making a live-service you should await a death-service."
43572491,english,0,646910,"As I played about 200+ hours in The Crew 1 I have to admit that in The Crew 2 I got bored after 20 hours already.  So let's talk about the things:  1. Price - way too much for this game. Wait for a sale if you REALLY want to play it BADLY. I didn't have fun when playing this game, which shocked me though, because The Crew 1 brought me so much fun. Very disappointing.  2. Map - landmarks are gone, they kinda replaced it with Photo Albums, which is not that bad, however it's kinda annoying (at least for me). Map is huge, but feels totally empty and unused, since they took fast travel to random places away and the map is unlocked, since the beginning, so not much of a grind to be fair. 3. AI - feels really weird sometimes. Sometimes it works normally and sometimes it's just impossible. I had the most issues with Drag Racing where I actually had to watch tutorials to have a chance to beat someone on normal (and no i'm not a total noob, the timing is just so crucial that you need to learn it, which is ridiculous). For beginners the AI is way too OP. If you new and want to have fun you will get frustrated really quickly.  4. Vehicles - probably the biggest plus in this game. There's a wide range of cars, etc., however, with all the classes (boats, planes) it doesn't feel like a REAL racing game anymore. 5. Story - Overall cringe atmosphere, a forced ""legal"" environment with big parties all over the freaking country. All nice places, which I enjoyed in The Crew 1 just for the nature are now covered with stupid banners and fancy lights, etc. etc. which takes the feeling away. The whole ""story"" is just a collection of short events, which are apparently huge in the so called TV.  6. Miscellaneous - The followers are replacement of the XP, which is not tragic, but probably annoyed many players who played TC1. The stupid chants after every race or completed skill and music is just annoying.   Overall it's a huge disappointment, there's not much room for grind. I completed all the races for all categories + all skills on 100 % in about 20 hours. I could do the photo albums and buy all vehicles, but the game is just not fun.  If you're new and you want to give it a try wait for a sale. If you're a passioned racing gamer or you played The Crew 1 don't buy this game. That's my OWN OPINION."
43432845,english,0,646910,"Pros: 1. Graphics are ok, but could have been better for a 2018 game. 2. Good car selection and upgrades.  Cons:  1. Cringeworthy voice acting and poorly made cutscenes. 2. Car handling feels like you are driving on snow. 3. Poor wheel support, at least they tried to improve it though. 4. Story is nonexistent, feels like they put a random plot on the last stages of the game. 5. Landmarks from the first game are gone. 6. AI is awful. 7. Map is huge but feels so empty, also the game unlocks the entire map by default so the game don't give you a reason to explore it.  Resuming: Not worth the full price, buy it in a sale and hope you have some fun with it.  FOR THOSE WHO SAY I ONLY PLAYED 0.8HRS OF THE GAME I played the beta on UPlay and my playtime says I have 6 hours on it. It's basically the same game."
43673830,english,0,646910,"[b]What it is:[/b] A massive open-world driving game that boasts the greatest map ever made in its genre but is screaming for more polish in virtually every aspect.  [b]What it does well:[/b] [list] [*]That map - a 1:40 scale recreation of the United States lifted from the original game but updated to accommodate essentially every type of motorized mobility with unparalleled variety [*]A genuinely liberating sense of freedom from a game structured to reward you for doing virtually anything in any vehicle anywhere (except for the PvP) [*]The [i]second[/i]-best game on the planet for relaxation behind Microsoft Flight Simulator - The Crew 2 is at its best not when you're racing but when you're treating it as a giant high-speed walking simulator with no story to speak of [*]An amusingly varied vehicle list that goes from the usual genre staples to things like a biplane, a helicopter, a hovercraft, and more [*]An equally varied array of activity types to engage in - including drift and drag races, aerial stunt challenges, monster truck arenas, demolition derbies, and more [*]A great photo mode held back only by the game's own visual inconsistencies [*]The weekly summits provide a fairly compelling reason to regularly revisit the game to do more than just cruise and chill out [*]Free updates for 29 months and counting [/list]  [b]What it fluffs:[/b] [list] [*]Despite already having hundreds of races in the game, the map still feels underused with loads of unused open spaces and roads [*]No open-world PvP races - a feature that existed in 2007's Test Drive Unlimited [*]No open-world or multiplayer police chases [*]A loot system that seems to be entertaining and somewhat addictive at first, but eventually proves to be generally pointless outside of some top-tier gear sets [*]The environments feel really dated now the second you stop to look, and both draw distance and LOD handling could use an improvement [*]As of late 2020, nights are [i]still[/i] ""broken"" by design and way too bright due to the developers' inability to properly implement car headlights [*]Strange vehicle physics engine that still doesn't know how to handle collisions convincingly [*]A cheating AI that relies only on stupid levels of rubberbanding to stay competitive [*]Strange UI/UX decisions - chief among them the refusal to save your location upon quitting the game and always forcing you to start each session either at home or an HQ [*]This game has an exceptional number of vehicle types for you to enjoy, but the number of vehicles available in each type is actually pretty underwhelming [*]Horrible story and writing with the only saving grace being how easily they can all be ignored [*]The updates may be free, but content is delivered as a painfully slow drip feed and a lot of the ""new"" cars are just reskins of the old ones [*]Paywalled seasonal content that doesn't seem to offer any real value [/list]  [b]Technical stuff:[/b] [list] [*]Disappointingly capped at 60fps like its predecessor, but it stays locked at 60fps quite easily too [*]Tons of environmental graphical assets that look like they're from 15 years ago if you stop to look and yet still pass for good looking when you're rolling by at 320km/h [*]Almost complete ultrawide support - HUD and UI are not stretched but remain confined to 16:9 screen space [*]Occasional minor connectivity issues [*]For some reason may become unstable when played with a Bluetooth controller [*]If you have two controllers connected to your PC (e.g. Xbox pad and flight stick), remove one before you start playing because this game idiotically takes input from all devices simultaneously [/list]  [b]Recommendation:[/b] The Crew 2 does do the basics right, but none of those basics can compete with what's on offer in Forza Horizon titles. You're basically here for the map or nothing else, and even that amazing map remains underutilized. The graphics engine appears in need of an overhaul as some serious issues involving pop-in and brightness at night remain unsolved almost two years after launch. It's a good buy for those who loved the first Crew - and its spiritual predecessors, the two Test Drive Unlimited games - and no one else."
45881599,english,1,646910,a decent casual open world racing game. recommended for people looking for such an experience.  pros - huge open world.entire map of usa slightly scaled down to explore. you can have a big road trip on your own or with friends. vehicle variety - the game is not limited to cars alone but boats planes and bikes as well. lots of different racing disciplines - ranging from street racing to grand prix to moto cross and rally cross. also featured is a cross country hyper car race - goes from east coast to west coast.40 minutes for a single lap race covering the entire width of usa. a great experience in itself. leisurely driving across the grand canyon or other such iconic places has its own novelty. acquiring the cars and upgrading them is satisfying. the set races are well made. snow and rain look nice. graphically the game is good but not upto the standards of other modern racing games like forza  cons -  game is completely arcadish with 0 damage functionality and the physics are very simplistic.its not meant for realistic racing at all. no real pvp features yet (there is an update in the works but no idea how or what it will be)
118350135,english,1,646910,Let me start this off by saying if you only plan on playing with a controller go for it which is why i'm recommending it ONLY if you're using a controller   If you have a sim rig or even just a basic setup with a wheel you will be extremely disappointed. The force feedback literally makes no sense. You'll be taking a corner and when the rear end slightly slips out from under you the force feedback just decides to fu*k off in a direction that makes no sense. There's an insane amount of options missing that would be in any racing game whether it's an arcade racer or sim with wheel support.   Next issue is the fact that for everyone on PC you are limited to 60 fps with no work around.....like...WHAT!?!? Iv'e literally never played a game on PC that limited my frames to that of a console. What was the thought process behind this decision?   Interface controls moving around the map with a wheel is extremely frustrating but you can get used to it  I have to scroll through every single wheel till I find the ones I want as there are no filter options unless I missed something but come on guys   On the vehicle selection screen there's these flashy light things grazing across the car tabs and is super annoying / makes it hard to see what you're looking at  Some of the cars wheels maximum size still are too small and makes the tires look like they should be on a rally car  Just because we have a sim rig doesn't mean we are limited to sim racers. Sometimes we just want to screw around in an open world environment and zone out which Horizon is great for but that's literally all we have and every NFS title with wheel support is probably even worse than this  In the end if your game is going to have wheel support why even bother having it in the game if you're not gonna do it right?
168231015,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 is a fairly good game but it's just a matter of time until ubisoft decides to pull the plug on this one, just like they did with the original Crew, If buying is not owning then piracy is not stealing."
103655459,english,0,646910,"This game is max quantity, zero quality. If you told me this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies, it would all make sense. Then they added rpg elements with rng based loot. This is a parody of a driving game through the lens of the onion.  For example: this has time trial races with tiered time targets: easy, normal and hard. Let's say your brain is broken like me and you accept the challenge to 100% this game and learn the absurd and downright comical driving model which induces even hypercars to lift their inside rear tyre like a civic on hard turn in. Lets say you can easily beat the hard time with a stock car. You still gotta run the race 2 more times to complete it to get rewards. Every stupid race has to be done thee times. Every. Single. Event. This is just one among numerous issues.  Every single thing other than car customization is the commitee voting for the worst possible option every single time. Its like if twitch plays racing game development with assholes. Just don't buy this microtransaction hell. Even if this goes free to play. Don't be me."
115958990,english,1,646910,"OK.  I'm going to write this as someone who has been a huge fan of The Crew franchise.  The short answer is, ""Yes.  I'd recommend this game.""  The longer answer is a little more nuanced and if you'd like to read a few ""caveats"" from someone who still enjoys the game, mostly......please proceed.  I have played this game since launch.  I owned the ""Gold Edition"" on PS4 and logged A LOT of hours there.  I then made the switch to PC and, as you can see, I've logged over 200 more hours on here.  There are a lot of positives that any number of other reviews will also bring up.  There are also a lot of negatives, many of which are not immediately apparent.  And here is where I am going to bring these up.  They weren't severe enough for me to not recommend the game, but they were important enough for me to mention.  1.  No cross-platform support or cross-play (not too concerned about cross-play though)  It's one thing to not offer this.  It's another to have very specific rewards for completing certain events and not allow people who earned those rewards to carry them over (or even allow them to use MTX to buy them back on your new platform).  Don't get me wrong, if they asked me to pay money for items I already earned; I'd tell them to get bent.  However, this business model here actively discourages people from buying the game on more than one platform.  Seems stupid.  I have numerous cars earned from PS4 Summit, but because my Uplay account is logged in to a steam version of the game instead of a PS4 version of the game......I can't use them.  2.  It's pitched as ""any vehicle, anywhere, any time""  No.  It's not.  Sure, there are plenty of events and lots of different vehicles, but the lion's share of events and vehicles fall in to ""street race"".  There are more ""street race"" events than all the other ""Street HQ"" events combined.  There are more hypercars and street race cars than any other class except for MAYBE Rally Raid and Touring Car.  I don't mind these events/vehicles, but it would be nice to get something else.  It's especially bad for Summit as most ""special vehicle rewards"" are just another street spec or hypercar spec.  The ""Xtreme Series"" (one of the more unique aspects of the game) has less than ten events and that's after they added some.  3.  It's ""grindy"".  Again, clearly I don't mind the grind, but I'd be lying if I said a large majority of my time spent wasn't re-running the same handful of events for cash and parts.  The RNG is hell sometimes and certain vehicle types just get aggravating to get parts for.    For example.  I own full legendary part sets on every single hypercar I own.  I managed to do this in about a week simply re-running the New York hypercar event,  It nets about 300,000 bucks on Ace and yields a BUNCH of legendary parts.  The event is a long cross-country event and takes around 30 min to complete.  Simple enough.  Jump on, run it once or twice, net cash and parts.  But outside hypercars (and one or two street race events) there aren't any events like this for the other specs.  This is ESPECIALLY egregious, because they had stuff like that in the first Crew.  It would be nice if there was a better way of earning legendary sets without relying on Summit or getting to Icon 1000+ to dump a bunch of points in to buffing your loot quality and amount.    4.  ""Vanity Parts"" and ""Premium Currency""  I have an issue with ""pay to customize"", especially on a game where customizing is a key component to that experience.  It's one thing to pay $5 to have a gold gimp suit or some such crap on Battlefield or CoD.  It's another to have these ""pay parts"" on a game all about customizing.  It's made worse by the ""Season Passes"" having a ""regular"" and a ""premium"" version and even the premium pass doesn't net you enough Crew Credits to buy an epic vanity part.  You get a couple extra vehicles (probably another street spec or hypercar).  I mostly bring this up because they used to gift Crew Credits a bunch more and just by saving up a bit, you could put them to use in amazing ways and made you WANT to play.  5.  The ""Online"" Experience.  It's not great.  It's better than a lot I've seen, but it's still pretty bad.  I've had invites from all kinds of people,  almost none that actually want to do events.  You join someone's crew, you screw around on the map until someone gets bored.  Someone joins YOUR crew, they quit as soon as they realize you're starting an event.  Maybe it's time.  Maybe it's the platform.  I can't say for sure.  I CAN say, the social experience WAS better when I was on PS4.  Last but not least, this isn't Forza.  If you're expecting Forza, then buy Forza.  This is more akin to the GOOD Need for Speeds from back in the day (i.e. Most Wanted, Carbon, Underground).  The physics aren't great, but they aren't horrible.  It's mostly just designed to goof off with and have a good time......not recreating what driving a Bugatti is like.  If nothing I said dissuaded you, then give it a try.....and if you see me around, shoot me an invite.  Just don't be afraid of doing something."
174024296,english,1,646910,"Fun game, bad driving mechanics, good graphics and very fun."
174845043,english,1,646910,"Bought for a dollar figured hey, why not. Started driving, then turned the radio on to come to one of the most wretched abysmal discoveries of my life.   Someone without dogshat taste in music is possibly still trapped at Ubisoft. We need to do all we can to rescue this person from their descent to french hell.   Which is a lot like normal hell but much more bougie & smelly."
140621252,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is an open world arcade racing game with the map being the literal entire USA, downscaled to videogame size obviously. Also, i'm hyped for Motorfest even though i'll have to wait another year because Ubisoft, once again, decided to go to Epic Games. They already did come back crawling because Epic didn't work as good as they thought and yet here we are looking at them doing the exact same mistake again missing out on tons of sales because of the selling platform ONLY. Anyways.  I have done every single peace of Content this game has to offer, from races to photo ops but ""skills"" too and i can tell you i hated almost everything about this game; special hate goes out to every single Boat and Plane activity. I loved playing it, i mean it made me play for 200h+ but i will not ignore how bad of a videogame it actually is  People complain about the Crew 2 but i think its for the wrong reasons; most of the critism is about the grindy aspect of this game and yes they are right it indeed is one of the grindiest racing games ever but to be absolutely honest.. i bought a racing game to win races, if the grind is based on racing then why would i complain? anyways, theres seemingly endless content to be played, most of it feels either the same or really really alike but i really appreciate the cheer amount of content Ivory Tower came up with, set peaces and special events really look and feel cool to go through but it is obvious that most of it were simple instagram filters being put onto your screen to make it feel different even if it mostly isn't.  Graphics are OKAY, it does look outdated compared to even older titles and the antialasing is basically non existent, the backmirrors do not work and your headlights are literally looking like transparent yellow JPGs to make it look like there was light but it actually is no light source at all inside the game engine, the steering wheel barely moves at higher speeds. It definetily has its moments though, it can look pretty and sometimes i had more NFS Underground Vibes than the past 5 Need for Speeds were able to get me but the fact the night time got literally massacred in order to cover up non functioning headlights really bothers me  Heres what i think is important to know before getting into it Anything you do, wether it be menu navigation or real time gameplay, it feels like a mobile game with PC features. Theres so many decisions made in design which simply go all against the user experience to make it as annyoing and uncomfortable as possible and i will have to give you a couple examples to make some sense of what i actually mean:   Every time you finish a race theres an unskippable animation playing telling you that you won, how much XP you got and how much money you earned, it takes almost 10 seconds every single time, right after that you'll see some funny colorfull packages spawning in front of your car so you collect them, these are literally random generated tuning parts which also have (feelingly) hundreds of additional passive effects besides pushing the cars perfomance. Once your inventory is full and you tuned up your car, you gotta dismantle the stuff you don't need and that.. takes way too much time. I could guess that 1/3 of my playtime was dismantling tuning parts only. This entire process is what you get for playing the game. The Tuning is based on RPG NUMBERS and STATS, its no new super duper new engine you build into your car, its literally the same thing now being purple instead of blue (rarity=quality) and the number goes up from 245 to 247.  Other than that the Visual Freedom of your car is astonishingly huge, less for the GT and Hyper Classes but more than ever in street race cars, generally the car selection is almost as impressive as Forzas is.  The AI in your races also base their difficulty on those RPG like ""Perfomance Numbers"", meaning your car has to have a ""220-Stat"" to be able to compete in that specific race; this system leads to the AI being either entirely broken or not existent at all. One side of the game makes you want to own as many cars and have as much variety as possible, on the other side theres really obvious differences in cars in same classes. Almost every Muscle Car feels underpowered as hell while other ""meta-cars"" will have no problems whatsoever; Some cars really do struggle a ton to keep up with the AI, others will make you simply drive the course to the finish line making it a personal time trial.  But wait! theres more! The Crew 2 has an RPG like Skill Tree. It enhanced passive things like ""slipstream power"", range, effectiveness, it enhanced your nitrous in 7 different ways and makes competing against other lower level people a joke; actually the PVP section of this game is dead since release because of the slipstream mechanic which is absolute BS, you can literally hear your car gaining +100HP as you drive behind your mate. This is a racing game, no MMORPG and most certainly no MOBA, i genuinenly do not understand how one could implement such things into a racing game, making a skill set almost obsolete (of course you still have to know how to drive lol)  Also, there is an ingame real-money shop for you to buy cosmetics, car bundles and battle pass though you can buy the battle pass with ingame money you get from playing  On the plus side though, i really like how easy accessable the multiplayer is. You invite your friend to the party, you choose a race and there you go, no overcomplicated crap needed for this.  I love playing this game but i seriously hate everything that comes with it. In sale for less than 15 bucks, its a good deal for the amount of content you get."
57370276,english,1,646910,"If you've played the first game, then there is some returning stuff that you're already familiar with. The big-ass map, the various racing categories, [b]the grinding[/b], the fact that you'll most likely never own all the vehicles.  Pros: - Planes and boats are fun, the quick vehicle swap function too. - The loot system has been improved (unless you really liked to grind for hours for each car individually). Parts can be exchanged within the category, meaning that you'll get new parts based on the highest parts you own, for any vehicle of the same category. You can buy a brand new, vanilla car, and just install maxxed out parts you already own. - Live Summit events are good.  Mids: - The ""you own one car and can outfit it for several categories"" system got scrapped. You just own a car for a specific category. Maybe it's also available in a different category, maybe it's not. - The ""story"" and most characters. At this point, they should just give up the narrative part. Nobody cares, and it's not very interesting. The issue is that it's an arcade game whose very scope makes it hard to explain stuff (you're not going to be surprised by an NFS game being about illegal street racing, but how do you justify the plethora of vehicles available in the Crew? Well... maybe you shouldn't.)  Cons: - Hiro and most in-race announcers and commentary. Gets old reeeaaaal fast. - Just like in the Crew 1, the driving experience can rank from pleasant to extremely frustrating and clunky. - Can take a while to get into a PvP race due to the player population and the waiting system sucks (being able to join ""on-call"" à la GTAO would be great). - Having to actually go into HQs or your house and walk around to perform actions. Who's got time for that? Why can't I just do it from the menus? - Speaking of the menus... Pointless animations, loading times... And the submenu for the radio that also contains race-related options. That shit is whack.  So, is this a transcending experience? Nah. But it can be fun. Get it if you liked the first one, or if you wanna play with friends.  1) Stay away [u]2) Recommended when on sale or for a specific audience[/u] 3) Recommended 4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must play"
43232418,english,0,646910,"So much AI Rubberbanding it's not even funny, Cringeworthy dialogue, Poor vehicle handling, Microtransactions. Wait for Forza Horizon 4."
43416459,english,0,646910,"If you want to buy this because you think it improved from The Crew 1 keep your money. I couldnt even get a refund even though Iv explained to support how cheap this game is. They used the more than 2 hours of play excuse, I had 4 at the time and thats counting all the cinematics, you basically cant see how cheap it is before passing the 2 hours mark. Keep your money."
54748485,english,1,646910,"After 50 hours, The Crew 2 has left me with a lot of wonderful memories. They aren't filled with the kind of emergent stories you get from exploring an open world and its systems, nor are they moments that involve goofing around with strangers--The Crew 2 is lacking in both those aspects. Instead, my memories are filled with the game's variety of vehicular activities and the wonderfully curated tracks: the unrealistic, the impossible, and the delightful.  It's surprising to see just how much The Crew 2 differs from the original game. There's been a noticeable shift in Ubisoft’s last few open-world titles, one that's moving toward a focus on player-driven progression--large selections of optional activities, non-linear structures, rewards for doing just about anything--and The Crew 2 benefits significantly from this direction. The gritty crime angle from the original game is gone, and instead, The Crew 2 takes reams of pages from the book of Forza Horizon. The game centers on a nationwide festival of motorsports where you, a rookie, are poised to become the next big star. While the setup is conventional, and the focus on social media fame is obnoxious, what it brings to the game is a colorful and upbeat vibe, an impressive variety of different disciplines, and positively ridiculous arcade driving on land, water, and through the air.  Despite the game's focus on real-world branding and mimicry of televised motorsports, The Crew 2's greatest asset is its willingness to be ridiculous. Races in The Crew 2 might involve jumping your street-racing car off skyscrapers, or your powerboat off the Hoover Dam. They might include making high-speed touring cars go head to head through the tight, windy Hollywood Hills, and motocross bikes take jumps across shipping freighters and freeways right before you transform into a prop plane like some kind of extreme-sports mecha. This is a game that will cover Los Angeles in three feet of snow for no logical reason other than icy roads make for more thrilling street races. Abundant nitro boosts, uncomplicated drifting, and generous rubber-banding also help keep the act of driving exciting when things are relatively tame.  As a game with an open world, races and challenges can naturally be found and initiated when you stumble across them at particular points on the map. However, playing The Crew 2 with open-world exploration as your primary means of moving from activity to activity reveals the game's major downfall: it's too big, and all the activities and interesting locations are too spread out. The game hides a number of boxes with vehicle components across the map, which you can hunt for using a proximity tracker, but even these feel too few and far between.  But with that in mind, The Crew 2 thankfully makes it easy to cut your commute down via player-friendly shortcuts. The game has an option to view all 120+ primary activities and countless more skill challenges (featuring things like escapes, slaloms, and a rewarding photo mode) in a categorized, list-style view, with the option to not just set a waypoint to them, but instantly start them no matter where you are in the world, at no cost. The loading times in The Crew 2 are impressively brief all around, so if you want to, you can churn through races and challenges back-to-back to very quickly and efficiently rack up progression points, earn cash, and set leaderboard positions from the moment you start.  It's an option that's both convenient and gives the impression that the game is conscious of your time. Likewise, any activity can be restarted or aborted in seconds if you're having a bad run, and there's a quick back-on-track feature that can be used any time. When you're not in an event you can switch to any vehicle you own immediately, without penalty, and without having to go anywhere. That's on top of being able to assign a favorite ground vehicle, boat, and plane to your right analog stick to allow for instantaneous switching during free-roam exploration, which provides its own kind of fun, for example, flying into the stratosphere with your plane before switching to a boat and careening back to Earth. Any vehicle that's available for sale is also graciously available for you to test drive on a moment's notice.  The variety of different vehicular disciplines in The Crew 2 is downright impressive--each of the 14 styles is tangibly unique from one another. Every time I started to get fatigued with one method of competition, I could quickly jump to another that had a completely different feel. Each is housed within one of four ""Families"" which you're free to move between to perpetuate your overall progress: Street (street racing, drifting, drag racing, long-distance hypercar racing), Offroad (cross-country rally raid, motocross, loose-surface rallycross), Freestyle (plane aerobatics, jet sprint boating, monster trucking), and Pro (power boating, air racing, touring cars, and grand prix).  While the execution of The Crew 2's disciplines might not wholly satisfy purists of any one given style, it does a great job of making each feel accessible, fun, and unique. I'm usually too intimidated by grand prix racing to give it a shot in other games, and I would never have even considered the idea of playing a power boating game. But, the Crew 2 encourages you to try a little bit of everything, and it's easy thanks to the game's approachable arcade-style mechanics, as well as the prospects of seeing more beautiful and ludicrous tracks.  And whether you're driving, boating, or flying across The Crew 2's America, it's a mostly beautiful journey. The game's natural environments, particularly bodies of water and the sky, look fantastic, as do weather effects like snow and rain. All are enhanced to breathtaking heights by the superb lighting, though the continuous day/night and weather cycle can be an occasional inconvenience during some events--whether it be afternoon sun in your eyes, snow obscuring track obstacles, or having to fly through a tight canyon in complete darkness. Where the visuals visibly falter are in dense urban areas. You likely won't notice buildings when you're zooming past them at 200km/h, but any slower and you can't help but notice how plain they are, especially in broad daylight with clear skies. Character models, on the other hand, always look incredibly basic, no matter the situation.  The game's RPG-style vehicle upgrade system returns from the original game, though it still doesn't feel particularly meaningful. You'll receive loot after every race in various stages of rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic), and each corresponds to a particular vehicle part and has its own power number, which contributes to your vehicle's overall power number. There is some small benefit to this system--all vehicles of a particular class, despite having different power levels in their stock configuration, will max out at the same number, meaning you can stick with your favorite car all the way up to and through the endgame.  I'm annoyed by the game's lack of public interaction and meaningless gear system, but I'll fondly recall both the tension of flinging sprint boats back and forth through the narrow, artificial canals of The Venetian in Las Vegas, and the easygoing satisfaction of an hour-long hypercar race from New York to San Francisco, where I listened to a podcast and enjoyed the rolling scenery. Despite its shortcomings, The Crew 2 still displays admirable strengths, which lie in its player-friendly features, freedom of movement, and its willingness to bend the rules in order to make things exciting and varied for an accessible, American-themed thrillride."
43896580,english,1,646910,"✓ 150 Hours ✓ Completed 100% of the game content ✓ Completed 100% of the achievements  Here is a rundown of Pros and Cons, with explanations, along with a score breakdown and final conclusion.  Pros:      • Captivating           -With each race comes different tracks, different skips, and different means of completing. With a percentage displaying the completion of a discipline (style of race) and an online competitive track time it’s very easy to get stuck into this game. Though a track can be completed it can always be done better, this factor is what drives the racers to become faster and better.      • Updated Often      • Good portrayal           -The game does an accurate portrayal of each discipline. Whether one loves Street Racing, Off-Roading, Free-Styling, or Pro-Racing, The Crew 2 provides just what one’d believe this discipline would be like.      • Tuning           -With tuning, and even pro-tuning, each vehicle may be adjusted to preferred likings. Tuning can make or break, quite literally, a vehicle. These tuning options can add Top Speed, Power, 0-60, Quarter Mile, and more.       • Great for a completionist           -The Crew 2 is not easy to complete, but it is easy to manage and observe the progress. Each discipline comes with a percentage of completion. In game, there is also an option to pin desired missions to track progress real time.   Cons:      • Poor story           -There is little to no story on this game. Your objective is to simply “become the champion”, which is done by just racing. The story focuses on being “follower famous” which is well, I guess a good portrayal of 2018.      • Awful commentary           -The commentary is quite laughable. Some lines do not make sense to even be mentioned, while others are just repeated.      • Inconsistency           -It’s somewhat of a hit or miss, funny pun, on which items are moveable. Some large trees are destructible while other small tables are not.      • Iffy graphics           -At times the graphics are phenomenal, at other times it’s feels like I’m back in 2007. The photo editor is very solid, but the in-game scenery is lacking.      • Poor reward           -Even when completing disciplines, there is hardly any reward. The only rewarding system is given after playing many hours and becoming the status of “Icon”.  -Scoring- Content 7/10 Graphics 5/10 Story Line 3/10 Score, 15/30, 5/10, 50%  -Conclusion- I purchased a racing game and I believe that’s what I got. Though the game is lacking in commentary and story, that’s not what I personally purchased it for. I purchased it to race, which is what this game excels at. The Crew 2 is a very entertaining racing game that will certainly give hours of enjoyment (as long as you don’t care about story line and such)."
91366795,english,1,646910,"Well well well!  It's 6 months now since i bought this one and i decided after 111 hours of gameplay to review it.  [h1]First the alternative titles i would give this game.[/h1]  Ford Focus hating simulator  Epic Car Wallpaper maker  Bugatti porn  The faster hatchbacks  The Crew 2 sponsored by Ford, Bugatti, Dodge and Chevrolet.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  The gameplay itself is really good, the tutorial (well it's a Ubisoft game there isn't much to expect) isn't well thought of in my opinion.  You start of with a vehicle the game gives you to finish your first mission.  After that you've been given a (rather small) selections of vehicles/cars for free.  The further you progress into the game the more options and challenges as well as vehicles get unlocked.  For the cars for example Ubisoft decided to help you progress by giving you a free Aston Martin Vanquish (which honestly helps a lot).  The game itself offers you various types of challenges and gamemodes so you never get bored.  When it comes to missions, i sadly have to mention that the npcs even on the higher difficulty seem to struggle sometimes. Weather conditions while in a mission are nice but could cost you your lead since it looks like the npcs don't struggle with it as you do.  More to that later on.  [h1] Design [/h1]  Even on a lower setting the design and graffics are good enough for amazing screenshots.  The cars are well detailed like the real life ones, you have a very simplified map and speedometer and the menus aren't in any way confusing.  The settings are nicely ordered which is consumer friendly.  [h1] The good things [/h1]  Amazing graphics with great detailing.  Good and constructive gameplay.  A good variety of vehicles to choose from.  A photo mode with a great variety of settings to make your perfect screenshots.  A huge and well detailed map of the US  A lot of missions and challenges to choose from.  [h1] The bad/salty things [/h1]  As stated earlier, weather conditions with bad traffic could easily ruin your race.  The Navigation responds very slow and bugged since the last update  The developers seem to gotten sponsored by the car manufactorers mentioned earlier because of the sheer amount of cars of each brand that are in the game.  Some car manufactorers that have produced amazing cars e.g. Toyota, Lancia, Skoda are completely left out which is sad to be honest.  The tutorial isn't really helpful when you haven't played the game before.  [h1] The confusing things [/h1]  For example, the aero of all the cars (even those with a huge rear spoiler) isn't considered even though the game tries to be really realistic  AWD(All-wheel-drive)-Cars like the BMW M8 behave like RWD(Rear-wheel-drive)-Cars, but FWD(Front-wheel-drive)-Cars behave like RWD-Cars with more traction  Some stats of the cars are confusing: VW Golf GTI 0 - 100 km/h   2.4 seconds HP: 550                                                               Bugatti Veyron 0 - 100km/h 2.6 seconds HP: about 1670  The weight of the cars aren't mentioned and most likely not even considered in the game.  So how could your regular Golf GTI with FWD be faster from 0 - 100km/h than a hypercar that costs irl like 3.5 million Euros?  [h1] My verdict [/h1]  It is a great game with a few twists but you can enjoy it in any way you like since it's an open-world game with many options and way to play it.  Do you like to just casually drive around?  You can just do it.  Or crash into the statue of liberty with a plane for fun?  Yeah go on.  The game won't force you to play it in a specific way.  So in short i recommend it if you like cars like i do.  Short notice: Please do not take this review all so seriously since it's my honest opinion on it."
43355631,english,0,646910,"UPDATE 7/13/2018: Just wanna' add in here that you will win most races, which I have been, you just have to grind parts for a couple of hours and keep your vehicle up to date or you will get smoked by the AI. Of course it's considered common sense I suppose, but it's also a bit repetitive as well. Nevertheless, I still think the mechanics of this game are ""Ridge Racer Type R4 bump the wall lose race"" type of sh*t. But it's not too, too bad. ____________________________________________________________  So far, after spending about 26 hours on the game, it seems like all you do is mindlessly race for better car parts against AI Jesus, and while that is of course the point of the game, in The Crew 1 it felt like there was more to it as you could venture off and visit landmarks all around the USA instead of racing, learning about known areas of the country while getting paid 2,000 bucks for each landmark you visit.... which seemed (imo) to cator to people who just like to drive around, and it also had PvP at the start. There seemed to be an actual story in The Crew 1 from what I recall also. Story in this game (TC2) feels like they went a TDU2 (Test Drive Unlimited 2) direction, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'll tell you what IS bad, mindlessly grinding against the ""holier than thou, on rails"" AI for car parts, requiring you to race damn near perfect. But I'll get to that here in a second don't you worry....  Also, what's the point of having a house or garage in this game if you can't even do sh*t with it yet? Can't customize it, can't have people over, can't do jack squatty. Seems like some azz backwards logic by the devs if you ask me.  I was also doing a Hypercar race heading towards Miami, paused the game, unpaused and suddenly there's snow everywhere down south and in Miami. Needs fixed asap. Funny thing is, I mentioned this when I sent a bug report during closed beta, guess they didn't get around to it yet? Idk.  In this game it's just the same sh*t over and over again, race after race against the computer with no variation in gameplay other than the fact you have planes and boats now. One big long azz grind to get better parts for your vehicles.... which don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with it, I quite enjoy it actually... or at least I WOULD F*CKING ENJOY IT BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE THE AI IN THIS GAME DRIVES LIKE IT'S ON RAILS!!!! YOU'RE A BEAST AND IN THE LEAD YOU SAY?? DOESN'T MATTER....IF YOU EVEN BRAKE A GODD*MN MILLISECOND FROM THE OPTIMAL SPOT ON A TURN, ALL 7 DRIVERS PASS YOUR AZZ UP!!!!! LIKE WHAT KIND OF BULLSH*T IS THAT??? COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE F*CKIN PURPOSE OF UPGRADING YOUR VEHICLES IF THE COMPUTER DRIVES AS IF JESUS CHRIST IS BEHIND THE WHEEL.......  *Sigh* Okay I feel better now. And with that being said, I love the game, but I think Ubisoft/ Ivory Tower can do a little better, c'mon now. Especially since these same devs are apparently responsible for TDU, which imo blows this out of the water minus the graphics. That's sad. I mean graphically, sound-wise, and car handling.... this game is a big improvement over TC1, with the nice addition of planes, boats, and whatever else bullsh*t they may have thrown in there.... it's all fine and dandy, but the game feels empty... I'm not sure why they released a half azz game. But I don't give a f*ck, fix the AI - The End"

[/td] [/tr] [/table]  [i] My impression of the game kept on changing at each progressing 5 hours interval. This review was framed after investing 30+ hours into the game and concluding the final rivalry races. The initial hours were so repulsive and full of meh impressions. But once you get a hold of a particular vehicle type and its handling, it’s all fun and excitement.[/i]  [h1][b] 📝Story/Plot:[/b][/h1] Just a generic plot setup to give your grind some motive and goal. A rookie entering the world of racing and guess what, some organizers see his potential and gave him a chance without even seeing him race beforehand. Just be #1 all around the events and conclude your journey after beating the top dogs who were the organizers too.  [h1][b]🎮Gameplay:[/b][/h1] [b]Initial impression-[/b] Imagine a hot girl with no personality. That’s the first 5-minute impression of The Crew 2. Starting off with high budget cinematics and performing short lap segment races while shifting to a new vehicle again and again. Sounds cool right? Wait until you see the whole f*cking world curve like in the movie Inception and Doctor Strange. At this point, my jaw was indisputably touching the ground. But just after completing a normal event race, it hit me with gloom and awkwardness. All that cinematic brag of “Speed is Life” and bla bla comes down to a slow race with the road looking like a low texture road. Like WTF?  [b]Mechanics/Controllability-[/b] I know it’s not a real sim racing game, nor advertised as a pure arcade. It’s unique on its own. But I feel like not giving it a category works as a bypass for some faulty mechanics. Cars feel slightly slow and weigh a ton on the controller. The purpose of a racing game is to acknowledge the speed atmosphere, which was only endured with top cars. Cars are not at all hard to control, rather easy and amusing. It’s the damn AI that makes all the races so tryhard. You are in lead for 97% of the race and suddenly an AI got a God’s hand and achieved supersonic speed. If you are thinking of bumping into them and play dirty, well have fun bumping a rubber band. All these aspects are blades of the same sword. AI feels difficult- what a tryhard game/Thank God it’s not cheap easy. Perspective matters here. I am not against it. Surely it’s sometimes annoying, but it iz what it iz.   It’s easy to understand how ground vehicles operate, steer, brake, drift, boost. But you are not familiar with aeroplane controls. Despite that, the first intro race makes you race an aeroplane. Instead of crossing checkpoints with my plane, I was crashing into enormous buildings and respawning. A terrible scenario that gets fixed in later event races where they teach you all aeroplane controls bit by bit.  [b]Open World-[/b] Take on the American motorsports scene as you explore across the entire USA. Being able to drive different vehicles like cars, bikes, boats and planes in the same open-world means not only you are free to drift your car on street roads, tread speedboat through the waterways but fly high across the sky too. Befitting pillars for the open-world statement. Now we know there are no restrictions, but what about interactables? Unfortunately, that’s a guessing game. Oh, I have a sharp turn incoming and I have to drift? Let’s do this then. You are halfway in your drift airmailing all those bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts in space, but suddenly you see a bench in between. That’s your stoppage. These randomly placed objects like benches or parked cars don’t follow Newton’s Law. They just wanna remain stationary no matter how hard you hit them. Trust me, these little objects ruined a lot of my lap times.  [b]Variety-[/b] You can use the astonishing top-notch live map, which single-handedly increases the game score by 2. Like how they even made it render the entire game in a 3D model just by a single click. Moving forward, the complete map contains various types of events/races you can take part in. Just for clarification, there are not AI vs races only. You can take part in a race against time, drifting, freestyling and a lot of car chases too. As I said, you are buying a complete package of the racing genre with multiple vehicle types. But there seems to be a hollow part of the story. During cinematics, you can easily see the top-quality work put together and the exciting race descriptions they narrate. But in reality, you won’t find those races in action. One cinematic had an image of a monster truck jumping out of a plane with a parachute, but there’s nothing present like that. They escalated the expectations through cinematic dialogues but disappointed us in the end. It’s not completely devastating as the default variety is already more than enough.  [b]PvP/Grinding-[/b] Sadly, you can’t run away from the “Look, there’s a level 1 guy with lvl99 car” scenario. It’s Ubisoft, which means expect a lot of transactions. Buy bundles, buy a season pass (Motorpass), or add in-game currency and get any high-speed car you want, but if you don’t wanna spend a penny, good luck grinding your a*s out. Be a part of a crew and evade the boredom of grinding alone.  [h1][b]📷Graphics:[/b][/h1] Enjoy a pizza full of delicious and uplifting toppings added on a half-cooked bread base. Now all your bites will have a random taste. Some will please your tastebuds, and some will taste like cardboard. The object detailing in the open world is great, but their textures, Oh Lord. Never expected to witness those low texture brick buildings from a 2018 game. Like, come on; all the vehicles, roadside objects, even dirt tracks look so good. Then why the buildings and gravel roads look like a dusty mirror. To avoid these bad graphic races, I played air and water races the most.  [h1][b]📝Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]  [b]Pros-[/b] [list]     [*]Big Open-world.     [*]Character and vehicle customization.     [*]Good chunk of playable time.      [*]Multiple vehicle types.     [*]Varied races and challenges.     [*]Offline or Online races. [/list]  [b]Cons-[/b] [list]     [*]Grind vs PayToWin is real.     [*]Semi cooked graphics.     [*]Annoying indestructible objects.     [*]No dynamic weather in the open world. [/list]  [h1][b]🏷️Tips to new players:[/b][/h1] Keep in mind, you can drift your plane. Without this, you are going to kiss the land whenever you take a flight. Don’t start PvP races until you reach at least the Famous rank. There are no restrictions on which racetrack to follow. So cut the track however you want. The first one to cross the checkpoint is the winner. Change resolution to borderless. Otherwise, whenever you will Alt+Tab, the game will start re-syncing, which wastes 4-10 seconds of your life every time.  [h1][b]😇Honest Rating:[/b][/h1] If you are looking for that NFS arcade or real sim racing like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, then just buy them instead. It’s nowhere perfect or overly marvellous. But I can assure you, if you invest enough hours into the game, you will adore it even as toxic relation. Only buy on big sale!  Rating: 8/10 Best world bending I ever saw."
88527600,english,1,646910,I played Forza Horizon (3 and 4) before playing The Crew 2 and it (the crew) disappointed me. Is more like an arcade game and for me is boring. I prefer Forza. I am not saying that is not a good game but I had higher expectations.
88608887,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is one of my all-time favorite racing games, mostly because of all the freedom the player has. I'm not like the average car fan, in racing games I usually like to see how crazy I can make a car look instead of customizing it as if it was a real world vehicle, and the crew 2 is the perfect game for players like me. The customization is amazing, there are dozens and dozens of different parts for each of the nearing 400 vehicles, including a livery creating system to make and share skins with the community. The Crew 2 also has a big variety of vehicles, including my favorite, the DMC DeLorean (though I hope sometime soon they'll add tesla vehicles to the game!). The map is also extremely large, with amazing graphics, especially lighting. The tracks/courses are fun and creative, although some can be annoying at times. Overall, I give The Crew 2 5 stars, and I would recommend the game to any racing fan."
164128496,english,0,646910,"Doesn't matter how good this game is if it just gets taken away from you whenever they decide they've taken enough money off of you. As a longtime player of The Crew games and a lover of The Crew 2, do not buy this game. Pirate this $hit instead. Ubisoft CEO said players should be ""comfortable with not owning"" their games. Start by not owning this one."
43749472,english,0,646910,"WARNING, DO NOT BUY DELUXE EDITION!!! I bought this game either launch day or the day after (Deluxe Edition) and here we are nearly a month later an I have not recieved either of the 2 vehicles in the Legendary Vehicles Pack, they were locked under ""Early Access"" and can now be purchased by everyone, problem is I have already paid an extra $20 dollars for them. Support is un-responsive and my issue has been ignored totally in the forums, so what did I end up with? I ended up with an $80 dollar base game. so BUYER BEWARE, get the regular version or the gold, deluxe is complete rip off."
81510860,english,0,646910,"In short, Great concept, ((STUPID)) expensive on top of also Micro-transactions GALORE!!!    In detail: The concept of this game is great! The map size (Friggin huge), multiple motorsports, and the amount of multiplayer potential is amazing! There is however a pretty BIG issue with the current way the game is going. Its following the same downward spiral a lot of other games are doing. ""premium currency"" and the so-called ""battlepass"" (Litterally worded as ""motorpass"" in this game.)   Now im not bashing on the battlepass idea entirely. if this game was free-to-play with DLC's i could understand...however this game costs a gross amount of money and it still feels like a ""free-to-play"" game. they have these ""Crew Credits"" (CC) that USED to be obtained via contracts. however now they are only obtained through this ""battlepass"" in order to be able to get EVERYTHING from the motorpass, it will cost ya 80k CC. You get 20k for free from the pass and an additional 20k if ya bought the premium motorpass. Furthermore most of the content of the game is locked behind this paywall. I'm sorry but if i pay $90 for a game, i wanna be able to play ALL of it. (Forza Horizon series did it right in my opinion.) Lots of cars to drive? yup but if ya want them all...gotta get through the paywall. Hey want a cool police lightbar? We got ya covered! Just spend 80k CC and grind your hind end off every day and maybe get almost to the END of the ""motorpass"" and you can have it right before ya get burnt out on the game!   Players are leaving the game because of this stuff and i feel like the devs are thinking ""Game is dying? welp time to milk every last dime out of the remaining players till it dies! Then we will work on ANOTHER game and when it dies, we will do it AGAIN!"" This isn't a game made truely for players, it a game made just for profit.  PS. Just bought some crew credits for my sis on her account with my card, Money is gone, Crew Credits not there. They are more than money monsters, they are scammers! Also, funny how i cant find a phone number for the ubisoft support. Guess ill have to have a conversation with a robot"
60802811,english,1,646910,"Let me get right to the point. I would not recommend this game if you're looking for a good racing game. I would not recommend this game if you are all about graphics. I would not recommend this game if you like any sort of story line.           I would recommend this game highly, higher than any other game if you're looking for something you can just listen to your chill playlist, cruise, and maybe even get boofed ;). I purchased this game last year (base game) for full price, I think I put maybe $10 into it after that to get a nice drift car, then I realized the games racing is shit.           So now I only play the game to go cruise the US and just relax and waste time. Nothing like coming home from work, heating up the rig and downing a glob, then just chilling driving around."
70528009,english,0,646910,"5/10 - Lots to like, but lots to hate. Could have been so much more. Full review below:  = Intro =  Sometimes, I'm in the mood for a racer. I fondly remember the days of NFSU 2, Gran Turismo on the PS and Most Wanted, games that not only lasted me weeks, but gave me new bands to listen to and endless replay value. Had this on my 'to play' list so got around to it. Enjoyed Forza, but it felt a bit flat and I wanted something with a bit more progression.  = Gameplay =  This is a racing game. Vrooom, cars go fast. But it's also a watersports game. And an offroad game. And a rally game. And a flying stunts game. And a flying racer game. And another dozen types of racing/stunt game rolled into one. Oh and also a loot game. You can see the problem immediately.  That said, man - this game does try. And sometimes gets it right. The water racing is immensely fun. Rally racing is great. Motorcross is mostly a blast. The absolute apex of the game for me are the lengthy 'runs' - massive races between cities, that lead you through towns, cities, mountains, forests etc. Glorious.  The weakest part of the game for me has to be the street racing, which isn't the nice, varied, speedy tracks you are likely expecting, but rather boxy, twisty monstrosities filled with right-angle turns. Right off the bat, these were frustrating as heck and some of the later ones will make you want to eat a kitten.  This has to do with the fact that a lot of cars handle like shopping carts and the more expensive ones handle like shopping carts with a jet booster. This game works best with long, open tracks, which sadly are lacking in a lot of styles.  Beyond this, every 'discipline' has it's own set of vehicles and loot. Welcome to the grind overdrive. And this is made worse by the fact that the sheer number of event types means that many only get a handful of races, total.  However the kicker is the AI. It...cheats. Rubberbanding is utterly crazy, especially when you start doing higher difficulty races - but unlike other games, it's only applied to give the AI an advantage. If you fail to drive perfectly on some tracks, the AI will soar past you instantly. Or it may just randomly do that anyway.  However once the AI is ahead, it just keeps on going. This is especially evident in the set-vehicle races where you and the AI have (allegedly) the same vehicles and specs. However, on Ace, you can enjoy the sight of the AI flying into the distance right from the get go, waving and flipping the bird.  This leads to a lot of styles being not only about driving prowess but luck, and finding ways to break the game. Weird, unmarked shortcuts, odd physics and the like. Sigh.  All of that said though, I don't hate this game. When it works, it works like gangbusters. Maybe if they had removed the boring flying stuff and produced double the races for existing styles, this could have been a winner.  = Graphics and Audio =  Visually, this game is a mixed bag. Water is lovely. Weather is beautiful. Lighting can be stunning. But textures are meh and ...wow, do cities look awful. Especially at daytime. Framerates are perfect.  Audio, rather than the mix of metal, rock, punk, rap and EDM you may be expecting is instead a small collection of the blandest EDM known to man.   = Style =  As I've said - too cluttered, too thinly spread.  And the interface/design is a nightmare. Let's say you do a race a few times, restarting immediately after you finish. Your loot goes to the mailbox. You then need to leave the race (loading time), go to a racing base (loading time), walk around, get the mail, exit the base (loading time), go to your home (loading time), walk up to your vehicle stand, change your vehicle (loading time) and then upgrade it.  Welcome to busywork.  But the absolute worst thing for me was discovering, after returning to the game after a long period, that there was no way to reset progress, whatsoever. Meaning if you experiment early and foul things up, there is no way to ever remedy it.  = Value =  To be fair, there is a lot here for the price, especially if you get this game on it's frequent, really good specials.  There are microtransactions, but most of the stuff can be earned in-game. However there is also stuff that can't. And I'm sick of microtransactions in AAA priced games.  = Overall =  + Many events are insanely fun + Original and well implemented loot system + 'Run' races are just awesome  - Impossible to ever reset progress/start a new game - Insanely cheaty AI - Frustrating street racing - Awful interface - Open world feels meaningless - Spread way too thin - Ubisoft style microtransactions  At the end of the day, this is a game I really want to like. With a bit more focus, less insane design decisions and some better/more interesting tracks, this could have been amazing. As it is...it's both enjoyable enough to keep me playing and flawed enough to make this hard to recommend."

135628343,english,1,646910,"[h1] This game is simply amazing! [/h1] The graphics are great. There is a [b] ton [/b] of content. Great progression too, you are always advancing, but little by little, making for interesting game play over time. It is definitely worth its standard 50$ price tag but I bought it when it was on sale for 10$.  Thank you for reading my review!"
180604033,english,1,646910,"Many people say that this game is bad, assuming that it is because of the horrible graphics you will always notice. Personally, this is one of the games that I would recommend to give some time to spend on because it is fun and the player has freedom to cruise around and do numerous activities whether you play by yourself or with a built crew.  With the ability to switch to another vehicle whether air or water while driving, you get to realize that there are so many things that this game offers. For me, this is an awesome game, though the sole issue I have with this game is that it is only playable ONLINE. I wish there is a feature where in you can drive around and participate in races even without the online feature or just disabled online mode. In addition to the free-roaming, there are races that provide the player a huge drop of cash and with the ability to increase the number of drop of car parts and money by progressing your ICON stats, you are guaranteed wealthy enough to purchase numerous vehicles of different disciplines that are so many that I am speechless of this game and how amazing it is.  To conclude. The Crew 2 is fun. Surely some will say the graphic renditions, especially buildings and environments have awful sight to it, but still, with all honesty, this is a fun game to play. If you purchased the Gold Edition, you will receive free, if I am not mistaken, 22 vehicles for free and few exclusive vehicles that you can get for free."
62437027,english,1,646910,"This game has received a lot of hate. Personally, I believe a lot of the hate it undeserved, but they can make some good points.  Starting with the pros: - Vehicle variety and detail. This game has over 300 different vehicles, and personally I believe the detail on the vehicles is out standing, even things as small as bolts for some extended fenders:   10/10  - Vehicle Customisation. Almost all of the vehicles have a wide range of changeable parts. There are many options to choose from in an easy to navigate menu, as well as bonus items that can be rewarded from playing the game by doing daily missions giving you a currency to buy special items such as under glow, custom wheels, tire smoke and more.         9/10  - The Map Size. The map size is where this game stands out above all. In a fast car (280Mph top speed+) with good driving it took me over an hour to travel from the southeast tip to the north west tip. In this map you will find several cities and other land marks along the way, also encountering the occasional player along your journey. The details in the cities are spectacular and the amount of places to go are countless.     10/10  - Multiplayer. The game puts you into a public lobby filled with usually around 3 to 8 other players, communicating with a custom chat menu which prevents and toxicity or bullying. When you want to play alone you can but on the other hand if you are looking to go on a road trip with a friend or do some races with a pal this game has made an easy system for you to do so.       8/10  - Race Variety. Currently in the game there and 16 different Motorsports events to choose from:       -Street Race, Drift, Drag race, Hyper car       -Motor cross, Hovercraft, Rally cross ( off-road ), Rally raid       -Freestyle ( Stunt planes), jet sprint ( Small boat racing ), demo derby, Monster truck       -Touring car, F1, Boat racing, Air race Along with these you get different skill based activities like Speed-traps and escapes ( furthest distance in a period of time ) as well as Photo ops of landmarks or player scenarios.          10/10  - The Summit. Every week, there is a series of events that you can do competing against other players in order to win prices such as followers, parts or occasionally, cars. This feature gives a deep purpose to this game, and for me a feeling like i need and want to come back to do those races and get those prizes. 10/10  Smaller mentions: -Unlimited garage space -Customisable car settings and parts -As you level up, you will receive rewards at certain milestones ( Cars planes boats etc )   And now the Cons:  -Graphics. This game can look beautiful, however a lot of the places feel empty or dull, like they need something extra. Also, the shading was poorly made, with a lot of colours looking flat. Like I said, certain places look fantastic and are very photogenic, however the textures aren't HD and could have more colour. With a simple graphics remake this game could easily be level with GTA V or FH4.     3.5/10  -Sound. Some of the car sounds are well executed, but for the most part they seem dull and like they could be more intense. The vehicles that do sound good are incredible, however a lot of cars that seem powerful get underwhelmed by the sounds coming from the engine.  4/10  -Weather. Now when i say weather I need to make it VERY clear i mean the weather changing, not the visuals. In my opinion, the rain in this game falls just short of GTA V rain puddles in the city at night, but with this game you can be in sunny weather, you go into settings to maybe turn your sound down a little and when you are out of the menu, boom: Thick snow. Even when it changes visibly to the player, it is too fast and too frequent. 5/10  -The Voices. Oh my lord turn off voices and turn on subtitles because the majority of the voices in this game are infuriating and get super annoying super quick.     1.5/10  -The prices. The vehicle prices can be realistic and occasionally generous, with a Buggati Chiron costing 2.4 million, but then when you venture over to the low end of the spectrum like bikes, you start to see prices like 500 grand for a sports bike. It isn't accurate. Another thing to mention is the grind for money. The money received after a race needs to increase, as grinding mindlessly for 3 hours in order to save up 2.4 million like I have done gets quite frustrating, and whilst it normally pays off, the pain you feel inside when you know the only way to get yourself that money you need for your next car is going to take 100 races of the same race is discomforting and off-putting.  Important note: i see a lot of people talking about rubber banding and i need to say i have never experienced this. I often finish races 10-30 seconds ahead when i use my super fast vehicles, and on other races like the 40 minute race it is often minutes ahead. If there was rubber banding, how could the times they are behind me be so large?  To summarise, I am saying this game is worth it, but keep it in your wishlist until it is on a sale to make up for the cons you may experience in this game.  Peace.    Side note to any active players: Anyone down to do some races together? DM me."
171979040,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2, a game where you can switch from driving a hypercar to piloting a plane faster than you can say ""Did I just clip that skyscraper?""  The game’s map is a condensed version of the USA, which means you can drive from New York to Los Angeles in about 30 minutes. Take that, real-world traffic!  Switching between vehicles is as simple as pressing a button. One moment you're cruising down the streets of Miami, and the next, you're free-falling from the sky because you accidentally transformed into a boat mid-air. Pro tip: boats don't fly.  The variety of races is vast, and so are the number of trees I've crashed into while attempting to pull off that ""totally planned"" drift. And let's not forget the photo mode challenges. Nothing says ""professional photographer"" like trying to snap a pic of a flamingo while barrel-rolling in a jet.  In conclusion, the game is pretty fun, sure the handling physics aren't anything like NFS of Forza, but the game has its charms."
174694396,english,0,646910,"[h1] Stop Destroying Videogames [/h1]  [b]  European Citizens' Initiative :  Video games have grown into an industry with billions of customers worth hundreds of billions of euros. During this time, a specific business practice in the industry has been slowly emerging that is not only an assault on basic consumer rights but is destroying the medium itself.  An increasing number of publishers are selling video games that are required to connect through the internet to the game publisher, or ""phone home"" to function. While this is not a problem in itself, when support ends for these types of games, very often publishers simply sever the connection necessary for the game to function, proceed to destroy all working copies of the game, and implement extensive measures to prevent the customer from repairing the game in any way.  This practice is effectively robbing customers of their purchases and makes restoration impossible. Besides being an affront on consumer rights, video games themselves are unique creative works. Like film, or music, one cannot be simply substituted with another. By destroying them, it represents a creative loss for everyone involved and erases history in ways not possible in other mediums.  Existing laws and consumer agencies are ill-prepared to protect customers against this practice. The ability for a company to destroy an item it has already sold to the customer long after the fact is not something that normally occurs in other industries. With license agreements required to simply run the game, many existing consumer protections are circumvented. This practice challenges the concept of ownership itself, where the customer is left with nothing after ""buying"" a game.     We wish to invoke Article 17 §1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [EUR-Lex - 12012P/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] – “No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss.” – This practice deprives European citizens of their property by making it so that they lose access to their product an indeterminate/arbitrary amount of time after the point of sale. We wish to see this remedied, at the core of this Initiative.   We also invoke Title XV of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)[EUR-Lex - 12012E/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] and the following TFEU Articles as our justification for and the Union’s imperative to respond to this initiative:  Article 169 – Per §1, the EU has an obligation “to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection…to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers”. We believe this practice infringes upon or requires correction to be commensurate with the EU’s obligation. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with videogames.    Article 12 – “Consumer protection requirements shall be taken into account in defining and implementing other Union policies and activities.” Given that this practice extends across Member States and beyond the EU, the Union’s actions regarding this practice ought to keep consumer protection in mind. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with video games.  Article 114, §3 – “The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection… Within their respective powers, the European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective” This practice undermines the high level of consumer protection that the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council takes as the basis of law in the Union, and their objectives of establishing and maintaining the functioning of an internal market as described in §1 of this Article, and Article 26 TFEU.[/b]  [h1] THE CREW 2 IS NEXT!

94458352,english,1,646910,"Easily one of the best arcade racing games out there. Most of the critics are by the people who either judged the game by playing just a couple of hours or those comparing it with other racing/driving games. Here's my take on its pros and cons:  PROS:  1. Map: Insanely huge map of the USA. Has almost all the visiting sites you can think of. It'd take you half an hour to drive from NY to San Francisco. You can never get bored of the map, period.  2. Car collection: Huge car collection from all the popular makes. They keep adding more every week and with every new update. Same with boats, planes, etc. You can actually buy like 98% of the cars without paying actual money. You might need some grinding though. 'New York' or the 'Uber dam' are good events to grind.  3. Car customization: You can customize almost everything from car color to tires, rims, wings, body kits, smokes, nitros, windows, even the underglows. There's also a good, active community that keeps adding custom liveries (skins/vinyls) which you can apply to your cars directly. And of course, there's a decent liverly editor too.  4. Race tracks: Challenging and fun race tracks. Some even have good shortcuts which you can master by driving repeatedly. You may try to break some of the world records.  5. Diversity: Various disciplines to choose from. You ever get bored from the street races, you can do boat race, jet race, air race, motorbike race, monster trucks, you name it. Although the game has good diversity, it's biased towards street races due to the number of events available in it compared to other disciplines. But then, if you're a street racing fan, that's what you want.  6. Regular content update: Really impressed with the 'Live Summit' weekly events with unique themes. You compete with other players to get the prizes. Prizes being special edition cars, tires, car parts, nitros, followers, etc.  CONS:  1. Graphics: Being a 2018 game, the graphics could've been better. You can't expect amazing graphics for such a giant map but the textures and reflections could still be better (as they're reused a lot). The lightings/weather system is good during the day with bright sunlight but it looks like a water painting when cloudy or rainy. The nights are okay at best.  2. Unbalanced AI: The AI in the game is somewhat unbalanced. I mean you can easily win street races or hypercars in Ace (highest difficulty) with a decent, well-upgraded car. Like a Buggati Divo or La Voiture Noire. But then you'll sweat to finish even the 'Easy' drag races without grinding.  3. Physics: Funny. If you're looking for a racing game with realistic or good physics, this isn't the one. They've surely made the car handling better with each update, but it still hurts to see a hypercar wobble at 400+ kmph with slight curves.  4. Optimization: I'm not sure how it scored 7/10 on GameDebate for optimization. I have a good GPU. Though it runs smooth most of the time, a crowded street race or a multiplayer with varied ping rates would cause immediate lags. Sometimes even kick players out. Even the processor and the GPU runs hotter during the gameplay as compared to other games of the same scale.  5. PvP: There's no customizability for PvP races. Also, the PvP player base is low and often results in a long waiting time.  If you're a racing freak who loves arcade and don't mind a bit of a funny physics, go get it. You won't regret. If you're into simulators and graphics, stay away. I've been a Forza fan myself (have a good amount of hours spent on the windows store version), but this game is still very fun in what it offers."

119911539,english,1,646910,"I ignored this game for many years because I thought every single event involved a mix of cars, boats, and flying. Oh no, I was very wrong.  Had a lot of fun with this one. I bought the base game on sale for 10 bucks. The season pass isn't necessary as it just adds more cars and a slight discount in the game store, but you don't need it, you just gotta play and earn stuff that way which to me is more fun.   I'm really glad there's actually characters and narratives that kept me interested. A lot of racing games are just go here, do the race, go to the next one, etc etc. But here the story, leveling up, loot and characters made it feel like I was aiming for a goal.   There's a TON of stuff to do. Street racing, hyper car racing, drag, drift, power boats, air races,  rallycross, hovercraft, motocross, touring, demolition derby, and MONSTER TRUCKS!!!! Those were my favorite. It's all arcadey feeling, so you can turn your car in mid air and stuff like that. There's also HUGE JUMPS which are so much fun. Plus there's loads of side activities like taking photos of landmarks, animals, stunts, etc, and escape missions, speed traps to name a few. Not to mention weekly events (called Live Summit) that have leaderboards and rewards are based on how many points you rack up against other players.   On top of all that there's these really cool movie like scenarios called Motorflix where you have to either do events for movies, or smash vehicles like youre in Burnout 3. AND there's treasure map type missions where you get clues and have to find the specific area and take a picture, which when all are completed you'll get a nice reward. All of it is completely optional. You don't have to do every single event in any section to progress. I jumped around a lot. When I got tired of races, I'd jump into some drag races, monster trucks, photo ops, live summit or the motorflix. Just whatever you wanna do.  Speaking of rewards, this game gives them out nicely. Not just cars either. You can get parts, cool visual stuff like neon underglows or colored tire smoke or nitro colors. It's basically a dopamine simulator.   Got all the achievements, completed the live extreme series and did over 70% of street racing, offroad, freestyle, and pro racing events. I also did all three seasons of motorflix and part of season six. There's still a ton of stuff left to do if I wanted as well.  The only stuff I didn't like was that since you can fast travel to any event, there isn't much reason to drive around the world. Kinda wish they would take a Forza Horizon approach and have billboards and fast travel boards scattered around to encourage this, but the way the whole game is set up is still really fun. I wish the game had more steam achievements too since there's so many things to do and unlock in game. Kinda surprised they had em in the first place considering it's a Ubisoft game. But the worst part is it's online all the time, which means when Ubi shuts down the servers the game will be dead, probably. So it's possible the game has an expiration date, unless they let people play it single player.   And let me point out that while the game is called The Crew 2, I basically played almost the entire game by myself. I joined a crew for a little bit and did some stuff, but then I guess I got kicked out but all of my progress was still there so no big deal."
173366642,english,0,646910,"I can't express how deeply unsatisfying the non-physics-based driving feels; it's worse than a cheap arcade motorcycle game. Furthermore, online required (see what happened to The Crew 1), terrible, LONG, extremely frequent cut-scenes, very poor UI decisions (I couldn't even figure out how to exit the game!), FPS and resolution limited, a mandatory anti-cheat driver, and mediocre graphics means that there are far better games out there. The only reason I can see to purchase this game is for its boat racing, but even then, it's boring, in my opinion.  I don't really understand the positive reviews given how terrible driving feels to be honest."
169260250,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 doesn't work on the Steam Deck because Ubisoft refuses to support it. They could flip a switch and allow Linux compatibility with the anti-cheat, they just don't want to.  Plus we now know that paying for this game does not equal owning the game. Ubisoft owns the game and they will take away your access whenever they feel like it, just like they did with the original.  They don't respect Steam Deck customers but that shouldn't be a surprise because they've shown through their actions that they don't respect any of their customers."
68680690,english,1,646910,"Put some music on, grab your favorite car, and just drive.  Edit: Forza Horizon 4 is now on steam, this game is still ok but Forza is WAY better at the same concept. don't buy this, buy Forza."
48440230,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 has got the potential for a good arcade racing game. Unfortunately it's not.   While the graphics look nice and the cars offer very good feedback, the whole setting sucks. The story makes you want to turn of your PC as soon as those ai smart asses, you have to team up with, start talking. Their constant advice makes you want to throw up, run away or punch them in the face. And they keep talking all the time.  Of course you're a rookie driving your way up to stardom by collecting followers. The dream of every six year old.  And of course your path to the top is riddled with obstacles. At least that's something Ubisoft really does well. Especially when this concept forces players to pay real money to overcome the hindrances.  Your main hindrance are cars because you ain't got none. Or should I say almost none. The standard version of The Crew 2 gives you a slow street car, a slow plane and a slow boat. At least this allows you to play some races.   You need to win races to gain followers. Ending games in first, second or third position also grants you upgrades for your vehicle.  Additionally you earn in-game money. In-game money is needed to buy new cars, planes or boats. And that's exactly where Ubisofts sales department steps in. In order to shorten the tedious task of endlessly driving races to win the money necessary to buy cars for different events or higher racing classes, you can simply buy in-game money with real money.   You can also buy the season pass which grants you two new cars every month for one year and an in-game discount when buying new cars. Of course the season pass costs real money.  You also need the best cars in order to compete with other players in multi-player mode. It will take you a lot of racing time winning the necessary in-game money to buy the cars needed to beat the competition. And you also need to upgrade the cars.  No matter what type of car you buy, you always receive the standard edition. So you need to drive races with this car to add upgrades.   There's a lot of work to get the cars you need. And Ubisoft made sure that there are many different vehicles you need.  - Street Race - Drift - Drag Race - Hyper Car - Rally Raid - Moto Cross - Rally Cross - Aerobatics - Jetsprint - Monster Truck - Powerboat - Touring Car - Air Race - Alpha GP  In order to stand a chance in multi-player mode you need to learn the tracks including all shortcuts. Thankfully the multi-player tracks are the same as the single-player races. This gives you the chance to train and memorize routes.  Contrary to The Crew 1 the USA is no longer the star of the game. Although graphics have improved, villages and cities look exchangeable. The unique atmosphere of Chicago, New York, San Francisco or Miami is no longer perceptible in The Crew 2. Even the countryside sometimes looks artificial. Not everywhere, but in some places.   At some locations it seems as if the developers didn't finish designing the landscape. There are areas where bushes and trees seem to be missing and hills are bald.  Free riding is no longer fun. That's because other cars drive closer together. The Crew 1 allowed you to race top speed in the middle of the highway passing cars on both sides. Try that in The Crew 2 and you will constantly crash.  You often find places where the game tells you to take a photo. You'll get an achievement once you took 40 photos in unique places. If you tell the game to mark the spot for the photo nothing is marked. You'll start searching but don't know where to go. There's no mark at all and neither navigation not mini-map can guide you. Then you take a photo and still have 40 photos left to take.  The same applies for extra upgrades. Extra upgrades are scattered all over the US. Once you move close to an upgrade your navigation system starts blinking and pinging. But if you search for the upgrade it's nowhere to be found. At least I can't find them. In 20 hours play time I found a single upgrade. It was a huge shining blue box on a field, twice as big as my car and it could not be missed. But whenever I search for them in a city they are nowhere to be found. Not sure if it's me but it's frustrating. I think it's bugged or again unfinished development.  I could continue listing disadvantages but I guess you get the idea. Steam only allows 8000 words per review and I had to shorten this one.  The Crew 2 is a mess and the games only purpose is to pull money out of your pockets. I assume Ubisoft forced the developers to design the game this way. Market target are kids and youngsters that are likely to pay for better cars. Make it colorful, rise their self-esteem by increasing their number of followers and make them feel important.  Is there something good? Yes.  The developers managed to make drifting very enjoyable and very well controllable, given you picked the right car. I found the Ford Mustang GT Fastback to offer fantastic drift control.  All cars feel different and every car behaves very unique. That's a point the developers really did well. Feedback from cars is great and you can really feel if you're driving a limousine, a muscle car or a beach buggy.  Pros: - beautiful graphics - many races - very good feedback from cars - all cars feel unique - driving in general is fun - very good car engine sounds - you can fine tune your cars in very many ways (if you find the settings) - all cars, boats and planes can be test driven (for one or two minutes) - some upgrades offer special bonuses - photo mode, including filters  Cons: - extremely annoying story and ai team partners - ...that keep talking annoying bullshit and treat you like a child - cities feel artificial and static even if they look beautiful - only random car upgrades - very buggy - even crashes sometimes - distant traffic very often vanishes if you move closer - feels unfinished - every race has an introduction where you have to drive to the start line and some idiot gives annoying advice or talks about other very infuriating nonsense - ...and it happens every time you re-start the race - tries hard to make you pay real money - the game even sells clothes for your avatar - vehicles are very expensive making it an endless grind to buy a hyper-car - limited fun - often hard to find players in multi-player although the game is not that old - multiplayer races are far less fun than in The Crew 1 - free ride is far less fun than in The Crew 1 and often very annoying - zoomed out map of USA is simply black and white and looks far worse than in The Crew 1 - cumbersome, annoying menu navigation - not a single good song on the in-game radio stations. Seriously - not one. Not even in classic. - emphasis on single-player - long start time - no cops - cars given to season pass owners can not be purchased by none season pass owners - even some T-Shirts for your avatar can only be bought by season pass owners - boat races are difficult because you loose a lot of speed when you jump over ramps while the ai somehow doesn't - rubber-band ai - annoying photo challenges - ...and a lot of annoying other challenges - the game does not grant you upgrades or money if you win in a higher difficulty but your car does not have the necessary upgrade class. Even if you actually did win! WTF?! - all player characters are ugly and can't be changed once you picked yours - you only get loot in races if you win - no reason to explore the map independently (unlike in The Crew 1) - drag races are still extremely boring - plane acrobatics are even more boring - monster trucks and hovercrafts are totally unnecessary - I couldn't figure out how to instantly switch between cars, planes and boats - I couldn't figure out how to join a crew"

112286236,english,0,646910,"Game is great, around 400+ vehicles in it, different modes, cheesy story, but a good one nonetheless.  Now, the negative review is about what is happening with Ubisoft - their launcher does not function properly, so they do not want to fix it for ""older operating systems"". So despite that the game runs great and smoothly, the launcher doesn't. Making new friends is impossible and inviting old ones to play with you together is impossible, too. Ubisoft needs to have a serious talk with their developer team:  https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/138532/createdxgifactory2-could-not-be-located-in-the-dynamic-link-library-dxgi-dll/41?page=3&lang=en-US  EDIT: October 2022:  https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/138532/createdxgifactory2-could-not-be-located-in-the-dynamic-link-library-dxgi-dll-windows-7-no-longer-supported/262?lang=en-US  Ubisoft broke their launcher ""Ubisoft Connect"" so their games will NOT launch on Windows 7, which is in their requirements.

68199299,english,0,646910,"If this game goes on sale for $15 and you have nothing else to play I could recommend this game. The sad part is, this is a good game. It's a lot of fun. But the reason I can't recommend it is because the PVP is completely fucked. The Live Summit is the only way to get exclusive vehicles, but good luck ranking high enough in the live summit to score one of those exclusive vehicles. If you check the leaderboards, its blatantly obvious that the top players (whom you have to compete against in order to win the exclusive rewards) are exploiting. You can literally watch their ghost use these exploits to achieve a higher score, meaning the only way for you to beat them and unlock exclusive vehicles is to take all the fun out of the game and use the exploit yourself. If you just want to play solo, or with friends, I can recommend this game because the driving is fun and the graphics are great. However as a fan of PVP and racing games, I can't recommend this game until the dev team decides to do something about all of the exploiting players that rule the leaderboards. They need to either remove the exploits and wipe the leaderboards, or make it so that you can unlock every vehicle in the game without participating in the live summits. Either fix the PVP, or give us a way to work around it and still enjoy the game."
160183351,english,1,646910,"This is better than Motofest. Screw you Ubisoft. Should've just made it as a DLC for this one instead of making it stand-alone.  The best Parts of games that play on a larger scale is that they can be expanded with time. Even with paid DLC. Euro Truck Simulator has almost all of Europe. With DLC. Why not looking at the competition?"
154144034,english,0,646910,"Games sold as Single Player titles should have offline capabilities. They should not have Always Online features. It is appalling how disconnected the companies are from their clientele.  As long as the product is sold and non-refundable, they are good. If the patch doesn't come out for the game that is being taken down just because Online features and upkeep of the servers are not feasible things for the company, it will clearly show there the interest lies.   People get it, keeping up with server payments and infrastructure is costly and doesn't get cheaper, but if you pull a license from paying customers just like that, I really hope people will take notice and never buy anything from them going forward.   I won't, and will do my best to advise everyone I can to steer clear from companies like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.   And I really do hope companies that feel that it's an okay thing to do to their customers will implode and close up shop. It would suck for talented people who work on good games, but they are not the ones that profit from their own creations.  Edit: If anything, it would be somewhat of a fun time to pirate games of the said company to enjoy them for free. And without the constant worry that the library I've spent money on will go AWOL because some asshole in a suit made a call. I'm more than happy to pay for games I play, but the sad reality we all worried about for about a decade and a half start to creep in - If it's not Physical, don't buy it. I'm sure there will be more and more precedents like this and the big companies will hide behind ""anti-piracy drm"" argument with their Always Online bullshit as well.

172145788,english,1,646910,"I honestly kind of expected this game to be horrible. But Once I finally got it working, it was a lot more enjoyable then I planned it to be.

177818626,english,1,646910,"I'd say this game is worth a try. There’s plenty of racing, though it’s kind of like the towers in Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry—you’re constantly grinding for something.  About that grind: collecting tuning parts (to get bonuses, you need to put together a full set of the same color and type) can be a hassle. Don’t expect to complete a set easily—you’ll likely be replaying the same race multiple times. There are around 200 races in total, each with three difficulty levels. I’ve cleared 88% of the main races and about 51% of the three other categories, and I’m nowhere near completing a full set on any car. But honestly, you don't need a full set. Once you max out your car’s power, you can just blow past the AI ​​opponents and enjoy the view.  And the views here are worth it. The game is gorgeous, and the scale is impressive. You truly feel like you’re driving across an entire country. The map might even be bigger than Euro Truck Simulator's, even with all the DLC. Each state has its own distinct look and vibe, and I loved the variety.  The one downside is that the game kind of forces you to try different modes. I wasn’t really into planes or Off-Road, though the boat races were surprisingly fun. Some modes just feel pointless, like Derby. It’s just cars bouncing around with no real destruction physics. And F1 racing doesn’t really fit either—the arcade physics don’t do it justice, and when you’re driving an F1 car off-road, it’s just weird.  At first, I hated Off-Road races and was ready to skip them. I tried MX, Aerobatics, and Touring Car instead, but that sense of “incomplete” pushed me to finish those 20 Off-Road races, unlock the boss, and complete all the achievements.  Overall, the game’s pretty easy—maybe too easy. To make it more challenging, you’d have to clear everything on the easiest difficulty first, and with a game this big, that can get tiring. I put in 30 hours and only got through half the game. I really enjoyed the hypercars, though; I’d be down for even more long races that last an hour or more. There’s something special about speeding down a wide-open highway, listening to music, and soaking up the graphics.  In short, there’s something for everyone here, so I’d say it’s worth a thumbs-up."

SUPER disappointed in this game. This isn't even worth $60 it's definitely a $20 game or less. Honestly a low effort trash money grab.  Ironically there was a warning at the beggining of the open beta menu, where it said that it was a beta and that it doesn't represent the full game, NOPE, that beta literally showed everything the full game had to offer.

176423165,english,1,646910,"Ubisoft is undeniably awful and I hold no love for them, but this ended up possibly being the best dollar I ever spent. I got it originally because the discount was just too much to pass up but didn't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as I have and will continue to do. This title made me realize I love racing games.   I don't know how deep any of the activities are compared to the competition in the genre but it's pure good fun. There's lots of variety in event types and tons of vehicles with impressive customization. The drawbacks are that the characters are insufferable, just about every line of dialog is cringe inducing and the voice acting is wretchedly bad — but fortunately none of that matters in a game like this. Maybe that's a plus if you can laugh at it, but for me skipping just about all of it is mandatory.   Just turn up the music and drive! Or fly! Or sail."
174581978,english,0,646910,"I decided to play this game rather than leave it in the steam library simply because Ubisoft decided to close the server of the crew 1 rather than proving a patch of allowing players to play offline. It's shameful. Back to this, a perfect touring game, a bad game, a terrible racing game. There are too many I can criticise about this game: terrible car selection in the menu, terrible handling and driving feedback, lacking of vehicle trade or hiding, and the worst is demolition derby. However there are many good about this game as well: large map and beautiful landscape, nice weather system and the best is the diversity of vehicles. Overall this game deserves a thumb up, Ubisoft is not. Now I think it's time to bring Vivendi back and put some pressure to Ubi."
53422750,english,1,646910,"Given my opinions and thoughts on its predecessor, I never thought I would've liked The Crew 2, let alone recommend it. But here I am. It's not a 100% recommendation, the game sure does have its flaws but for the price I paid during this sale, it's well worth it and deserves praise. And considering how much this game tries to get as close as possible to its competitor Forza Horizon, a comparison between the two games is as natural as it is mandatory. Let's examine its strengths:  Map: it's HUGE. I really mean it. It's huge unlike any other map you have seen in any other racing game. Looking at Forza Horizon's maps makes them look like they're the size of an ant. And unlike in The Crew 1, I get a feeling of traveling in the middle of nowhere much less frequently. Environments are diverse and there is more attention to details. Many opportunities for offroad. It really gives you a sense of freedom when exploring. Big yes.  Loading times: ... loading times? Never heard of that. Seamlessly teleport around the map and change vehichles on the fly. No waiting.  Content: cars? Let's be honest, that's the main reason we play this game for, right? Not just street-legal cars, but also offroad trucks and buggies, rallycross cars, and hypercars. But we ain't got only that. We have boats, planes and hovercrafts at our disposal as well. Which of course are a nice addition, but we're most likely going to spend most of our time in our beloved 4-wheel vehichles (2 wheel if you're into bikes, we got that too). And the game's car park is vast enough as well. Forza by contrast only offers cars... but a much wider selection of them.  Map activities: unlike in The Crew 1, these are not mandatory to grind in order to upgrade your car (which can take a serious amount of time if you're extremely unlycky), but there is only a goal to beat. That's it.  Sound: they're pretty good. That's judging from the Alfa Romeo Giulia, which sounds exactly like its real life counterpart, so I assume other sounds should be faithful to what they're supposed to reproduce.  Car performance upgrades: it's not good but it's still a great improvement from the previous game. Anytime you complete an event, you're guaranteed to receive a car part that's better than those already installed in your cars. And all performance parts are shareable across all vehichles in the same category, without being bound to the specific vehichle you obtained them with. You can potentially use a single high leveled car to obtain performance parts to upgrade all other similar vehichles almost instantly. Still not as good as just buying them with your own money but I'm not complaining...  Soundtrack: I can't describe how much more enjoyable this is compared to The Crew 1. I can finally play more than the only one decent song in the entire songlist.  Story: glad they ditched the story element. The plot in The Crew 1 was poor to say the least and I'd much rather have a generic motorsport event as a context than that. Annnnd this is where it's clear that this game is trying to get close to Forza Horizon. Win, progress across the various rounds of said generic competition, become the champion.  Now, to the ""meh"" parts:  Graphics: they're all but impressive. In fact it looks quite like The Crew 1. Except it even goes backwards. I'd like to know who thought it would be a good idea not to enable users to switch TAA off. The result is that the game looks like it's being run on console, extremely blurry at 1080p, like it was rendered at a lower resolution. While it can be disabled in a settings file, it breaks effects that rely on it, such as reflections. But hey, at least it will look crisp. Overall geometry detail is also mediocre. Oh, and also forced 60 FPS cap. No contest compared to Forza.  AI and difficulty: I'm getting Mario Kart flashbacks.The rubberbanding is just insane. And the difficulty balance across the events is way off. You will see opponents in front of you slowing down to let you pass only to see the same opponents zoom at godlike speeds past you once you're in front. And instead, in the RAID events, the prerecorded ghost is easy to beat, letting me win with a comfortable 40 seconds gap on average using a car with the recommended performance rating for the event.  Physics: better than the previous entry. Cars are still going to be prone to drifting and handbrake will still be useless (sending your car into an almost full stop the moment you press it and steer afterwards) but the driving experience remains overall enjoyable once you get used to it. It just... doesn't feel as natural as Forza.  Disciplines: this games does so many things at once and as a results doesn't shine in anything in particular. But being it arcade-oriented and given what I paid for it, it's not too much of a downside. It still includes and offers way more variety compared to its competitors.  Always-online: as far as I can tell, there is not too much focus on the online element... so why force us to be connected at all times? Folks with unstable internet connections such as myself don't like this you know.  In conclusion: give it a try. Not at a full price, though, or you risk feeling severely disappointed. In fact, I'd much rather pay full price on Forza than this. But overall... it's fun."
43517564,english,0,646910,"Pros: 1. Various race types. Air/Land/Water all in one. 2. Good Car selections.  Cons: 1. Bad controls for cars. Yes, it is arcade, not supposed to be realistic, but I don't really think it should feel like your tires is not sticking to the road. 2. Confusing key mappings. It does not tell you the controls when you got thrown into your first race/demo. The pause menu is not ESC but F10. You cannot have completely separate key binding for vehicles and airplanes. 3. Graphics is all right but could be a lot better. But why there is still a 60-FPS frame limiter? 4. Not really better than The Crew 1, if not worse.  Final Thoughts: If you want to buy this mainly because of car racing, there are many more options better than this one. NFS series for arcade, Forza Horizon for semi-arcade, Assetto Corsa/Project Car 2/Forza Motorsport for simulation side.  P.S.

136001664,english,1,646910,"[h1] Drive like you stole it! [/h1] The Crew 2 is an open-world racing game developed by Ivory Tower and published by Ubisoft. It was released in 2018 and is a sequel to the original The Crew game. The game allows players to explore a vast open-world recreation of the United States, race against other players online, and collect a variety of vehicles, including cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles.  [h2] Pros and cons [/h2] [table] [tr] [th] 🟩 Positives [/th] [th] 🟥 Negatives [/th] [/tr] [tr] 	[td] - Expansive open-world with a variety of environments to explore  - Impressive level of vehicle customisation  - Wide range of vehicles to collect, including rare and unique ones  - Well-designed vehicle models with realistic handling  - Weekly events and challenges provide a sense of progression and competition  - Impressive graphics and sound design 	[/td] 	[td] - Grindy nature of the game may be off-putting for some players  - Limited storyline and lack of compelling characters  - Some ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits  - Multiplayer PvP mode is limited to simple point-to-point races  - Some bugs and issues with the game, though most have been addressed through updates and patches. 	[/td] [/tr] [/table]	  [h2] Gameplay [/h2] The Crew 2's gameplay is enjoyable and immersive, with a strong emphasis on exploration and racing. The game's expansive open-world allows players to explore various environments, from bustling cities to scenic countryside landscapes. The game's attention to detail is impressive, with realistic handling of the different vehicles and a wide range of customisation options.  [h3] Events [/h3] The game's ""live summits"" events are weekly events where players can win vanity items or time-limited cars. However, some players may struggle to win the top prize without first obtaining cars and parts that give them an advantage. The game's multiplayer PvP mode is a simple race from point A to point B.  [h2] Vehicles [/h2] The game offers rare, unique vehicles not usually found in other racing games. The game's vehicle models are well-designed, and the level of customisation is impressive, allowing players to almost widebody every car. However, some of the game's ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits, which may be off-putting for some players.  [h2] Story [/h2] The game's story is minimal, with no clear protagonist or antagonist, and the game focuses more on exploration and racing than storytelling. However, the game's open-world and the various challenges and events provide a sense of progression.  [h2] Graphics and Sound [/h2] The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed vehicle models and environments that look and feel realistic. The game's sound design is also noteworthy, with diverse sound effects adding to the immersive experience.  [h2] Conclusion [/h2] Overall, The Crew 2 is an enjoyable and immersive racing game that offers a vast open-world, a wide range of vehicles, and various events to compete in. The game's attention to detail is impressive, and the vehicle models are well-designed with realistic handling. However, some players may find the game's grindy nature and lack of a compelling story mode to be a turnoff. Nevertheless, The Crew 2 is still a game worth playing for racing fans and those who enjoy exploring and customising their vehicles."
120846641,english,1,646910,"I tried this game when it was free for a weekend, and decided to buy it. It is a very relaxing racing game which I play after office hours.  Positives: - There is a lot of content, and not the usual boring and filler material. So many types of races, including destruction derby, bike races and boats will keep you busy. - It is easy to upgrade cars, you get a lot of materials to upgrade. Live Summit changes every week and provides good rewards so leveling up is easy. - This game has one of the best ways to display the map that I have seen in a racing game.  - On Normal level, it is an easy game, so I play the race on normal and win, then try it on hard (and win again most of the time).   Negatives:  - Ubisoft - In a lot of races, you race against a ghost and there are no other drivers. - Soundtrack is mediocre. Racing games like NFS and Forza have one of the best soundtracks, something you enjoy while driving, but not here. Very okish.  - Graphics are good, but at some places, houses look like boxes.  - Online component is dead.  I also find the plane controls pathetic, although I am not sure if others feel this too.  Overall, it is worth the money. Get the gold edition, so that you have a headstart with extra cars and content."

I have finished all of the achievements before writing this review.  Multiplayer arcade race game where you race others with cars, bikes, boats and planes with a full controller support. Characters and story are forgettable, the gameplay though is very fun. If you are looking for realism, this is not a place for you. No police, traffic light changes every 2 sec, no vehicle damage (just scratches), drag cars can reach the speed of almost 700kmh (434mph), if you put side exhaust you will still have rear one.  The game loads once, and you are ready to go! The fast restarts, smooth vehicle swap, travel to challenges etc. Amazing car details and they sound awesome (except motorcycles). Radio offers a variety of different stations so every person can find something for them to listen (and I did not know about it because of a lack of tutorial and guidance in this game). Nevertheless, the world feels empty and lacks some serious gameplay. There is almost no reason to explore the in-game world apart from taking photo opportunities. There are no collectables, few skill games and limitless highlights with top speed, high jump and long drift.   Lots of vehicles, various race types, decent co-op gameplay BUT no PvP. The Crew is all about the PvP and it is not here at launch. ""The Crew 2"" has many of the same cars but in different categories, so if you buy a car in a Street Race category, you can use it for that only compared to the first game.  You can but a Ford Mustang as a Street, Drift, Drag, Track and Monster Truck. And here comes the currency problem. I hate games with microtransactions, but at least here you can play without the urge to spend some real cash. Although the prices are ridiculously high, it is not that hard to grind it out. Performance parts will come as a loot for finishing a race (green, blue, epic and I think legendary will be added with later updates), and it will take a long time to max out a single car because you can get parts with lower performance than what you have. Rare and Epic parts will have 1 and 2 additional modifiers respectively and you can use it to boost your gameplay in many ways.  Car customisation is pretty good but it is limited to the Street Racers Family (Cars with yellow icon) and Monster Trucks. For other classes, you can only change their wheels! You can create your own livery or download one of the popular ones and at least this feature is for all of them.  The game leaves a huge levelling potential (up to 9999) but to be honest there is no reason to do so, because at 600 is your last car reward, and every 10 levels from that point are just epic loot.  Races may vary from short ones up to 40min long with a ""rubber-banding"" difficulty which can be brutal since you will drive at your limits and AI will sometimes push you around and frustrate the hell out of you.  What is a ""Rubber Banding""? - Pushes them towards you if you are far from them and lowers their speed if you are too far behind. So, if you are driving at your and car's limit, the AI (especially 2nd place) will go into hyperspeed to catch up with you. They are not that generous if you fall behind but the AI will still slow down.  Now, I want to speak of things that frustrated me the most - lack of tutorials and a car reset. The game lacks tutorial in some cases! There are so many questions and no clear explanation or indication on how to do some stuff: how to shift a drag car, where is the mailbox when to use two different modes of boats etc. The last one will be verbally explained by one of the characters but if you miss it...   Now, the car resets... It takes 2 FULL seconds to put it back on track and sometimes it will put you WAY back in the race and if you happened to make a mistake in a 40 min long race, you are royally screwed. I was 1st and one small mistake (because the game doesn't show you the raceway like it should) + reset made me the last place with a 10 sec gap to 7th place. I saved the run and finished first but I was at 30% of the race when that happened.  Although I would still recommend this game but not for a full price unless everything I have said above is fine for you. As they did with ""The Crew"" they will add more content in here and it will feel much better to play it but until then, wait for a sale.

43245527,english,1,646910,"I've seen a lot of mixed reviews, I recommend it although it isn't a perfect game.  Some people seem to complain about landmarks and graphics. I find the graphics are great, and i couldn't care less about landmarks.  The MOST important thing to keep in mind, this is an ARCADE STYLE racing game. Not a simulator. If you wanted hyper realism then look elsewhere.  - Great vehicle selection - Good controls - Extensive Customization (you can get lost in it for hours) - Reward vehicles from the previous game - Playing with friends - Larger map area - Larger selection of events to do - More content to come  Here are some flaws (some major)  - Voice acting is ridiculous. No adults speak like these do. - WHERES THE MULTIPLAYER RACES?! (I know, they said they come in December, but most of us bought the game for the MP experience) - Not enough physical damage to vehicles (they seem to have dropped the ""repair"" feature) - Transition from car to boat to plane could have been slightly smoother    Everyone has a different opinion on the game. I'm just being honest. In terms of what I expected out of the game, I got exactly what I wanted... minus the delayed PVP/Multiplayer Racing.  I recommend the game, as long as players remember this is an ARCADE STYLE racing game, and not a simulation."
72413284,english,0,646910,"TL;DR - Ok, it is not that I hate this game, but I just don't recommend it.  For what it is worth, I have fun playing, the customization is nice and the driving feels (for the most part) good. What I have the most issue with is the glitches, minor inconveniences to game breakers. At the time of posting this review, the game literally does not start despite my efforts to get it to do run beyond the title screen. There is also a rather large amount of questionable choices in regards to what you can just blow through and what will crash your vehicle. My last real complaint is the lack of police chases that were present in the first game, while it doesn't exactly fit the ""story,"" it would have been nice to have been included for more incentive to explore and drive around.  Fortunately there is a lot I do like about the game. The car selection is very nice and while I am not the biggest fan of the boat/plane additions, I could see some enjoying the features thoroughly. I also like the Summit activities, which once a week update and always give me something to come back to (while it may be just recycling races from the base game). I also never have felt a need to resort to microtransactions.   In conclusion, I do like this game, after all, there is a reason I have dumped 150+ hours into it, but if you are on the fence, I can only recommend it on a decent sale. Otherwise, Steam offers some NFS games now that may better suit what you may be looking for. Cool game, but a bit lackluster."
156581569,english,0,646910,Great game but don't feel like playing it anymore since I feel like nothing I do will matter as this game will shut down just like the first Crew title and I'll lose all progress.

94158049,english,1,646910,"What is this game like? A game with a huge world, with an abundant number of vehicles, you can explore not only land, but also air and water. The actions of the game take place in the United States of America, during the game you will have where to turn around, drift, drag, ring races, as well as races all over the map, there will be no borders in front of you. ... You can buy a car of any level, the first good car will not be long in coming. Farming money in the game happens pretty quickly, but it's no less interesting from it. The map shows major cities in the States, as well as their attractions. Simply stunning graphics, effects of water, mud, rain, sun, clouds. Also, during the game you will visit the winter season, the physics of the car will change quite noticeably, which cannot but rejoice. But there are also disadvantages, your car in the game is not titanium, a small tree, like in Forza, will not be able to knock down, when it collides with a stone, it will most likely not stop it, but throw it up. In this game, cars are more like jumpers. I think we will stop at this and will not continue talking about the shortcomings of this game, but talk about the interface and additional functions.  The game has a very simple and beautiful interface, the eye rejoices looking at the picture in the hall. Also, the game is equipped with a photo function, at any moment of movement you can stop the moment and become a real photographer. You will be able to publish your work on the official website of the game.  The game also has character customization, leveling up skills, making a model out of furniture to make everyone envy you.  In conclusion, I want to say that it is a very rich game, its advantages overlap all the disadvantages, many updates have been made to the game, as well as a battle pass, if you are not sure about buying the game, then look at its reviews on the Internet. Thanks for attention !"
43257197,english,0,646910,"Ok, gonna keep this short. Don't buy this game.  With Forza Horizon 4 just around the corner, I'd recommend waiting for that.  This game has a lot of cool ideas and neat features, but is flawed in two MAJOR ways.  1. No person that likes customizing cars wants to get their parts from random loot at the end of races. That's just cringeworthy.  2. The physics are god awful. Turning feels lazy, there is no sense of speed, everything seems to float like GTA IV, and a lot of the control is handled by assists that dont turn off. There ends up being no sense of skill involved in driving.  What the hell good is a racing game about building and racing cars, when the building is largely out of your control, and the driving is completely unsatisfying?   Also, as a nitpick, the game is capped at 60fps, and the car models are pretty damn poor compared to Forza. The lighting model in this game is awesome, thats about it."
108925094,english,1,646910,"If you like racing game, enormous map with all sorts of diversity, many cars with many customisation and regular new events, then this game is definitely for you. Be a fearless racer or just fun chill driver, this game offers me so many things."
161895806,english,0,646910,"I used to be able to say ""yes, get this game,"" but now that you've taken it's predecessor offline, I cannot and won't. How long do we have, maybe another 2 to 3 years for this game? Possibly even less because of your focus on the other game? I don't like modern Forza games, but at least they let you play their older games even without an online connection. If you can't even do that for your consumers, then why bother make anymore games?"
84255376,english,0,646910,"This game was once a haven, once a miracle. It was an actually good racing game in the modern era. A rarity. But then The Chase happened. Before The Chase released in November 2020, I played this game almost every single day. I no-lifed it, grinded out every event, car, part, you name it. It was my favorite game. Then The Chase came along and ruined everything. It removed the ways to get the secondary currency (Crew Credits) by doing Daily tasks. Instead, the only way to get this currency now? Pay REAL MONEY. They also added the ""Motorpass"" system which locks a ton of content behind a paywall. These mechanics are horrific and make the game feel like a F2P, but it's a paid game! Absolutely ridiculous. I, along with many players, stopped playing after The Chase released and permanently changed the game for the worse. I finally came back to it a few days ago just for the game to almost explode my GPU because the PC port of this game is absolutely atrocious for optimization and decided ""enough is enough. It's time to let go."" I will be uninstalling the game after posting this review, but before I do let me run down every reason why you should not play this game, or at least be very weary about doing so.  -Optimization. I have a very decent rig, and yet this game THROTTLES my computer. Not to mention the game constantly crashes, and sometimes will lock up your computer for upwards of 20 minutes by doing so. If you still want to play this game after reading this, PLEASE consider playing a console port instead. As I said, this game could very well cause damage to your computer if you don't take caution. The game almost caused my GPU to break before I uninstalled it.  -Monetization. As I said in the first part of this review, The Chase introduced very predatory microtransactions into the the game. They are not forced, but they lock a lot of content behind a paywall and try to bait you into buying it. Very scummy.  -Repetition/Bland single player experience. The single player experience gets very repetitive and boring. The game has a very obvious bias to Street Racer events. There are 50 different Street Race events in the game. For perspective, no other class in the game breaks 20 unique events. Most classes don't break *10*. The game advertises itself as having tons of different vehicles and event types, but really it only focuses on Street Race. This applies to updates too, as 90% of the new events and cars that get added are Street Race or Hypercar class. On top of all of this, the singleplayer ai is ridiculously easy. The ""Races"" are more or less time trials with ai. Do not expect a challenging and enthralling singleplayer experience.  -Lack of understanding between devs and players. The devs do NOT listen to the feedback of the players, they just do as they please. The community went up in flames after The Chase, but the devs issued one statement that boiled down to ""we don't care, keep whining"". They do not listen. They do not care. The playerbase means nothing to them besides a means to make money. Do not expect the devs to do the right thing.  -Lack of variety. For a game that advertises itself for being diverse and varied, it sure isn't. The basegame gave us some variety sure, but all the content updates add the most generic and boring cars possible. Not to mention that other vehicle types such as boats, planes, bikes, etc NEVER get new content. They might add a new bike once every few months, but you will never see new boats or planes or other vehicles. And yet they will add pointless reskins of existing cars that nobody asked for all day long... They very obviously only care about adding the most predictable and uninteresting vehicles possible, so don't let the promise of variety fool you. You could easily get a similar car list out of other franchises.  -Boring events. This goes back to the boring and repetitive nature of the game, but most of the events are very boring and uninteresting layouts. There's a few good ones, but most of the tracks are extremely simple and easy. Very few sharp turns or hairpins, no traffic in races, overly long and tedious, etc. The ai will not pose a threat, and the track layouts will bore you to death after you play for a while.  -Empty and bland map. Lots of copy/paste in the map, lots of stretches of empty road, lots of areas lacking detail and feeling soullessly void of life, lots of extremely condensed towns and cities, it just feels like a very cheap map and is actually a downgrade from The Crew's map. No joke, look it up on YouTube. They downgraded the map bewteen games and it shows. A lot.  I had positive things to say about this game some months back, but all of my good will and love for the game has evaporated. I will still list some of the good things this game does however, just to be fair.  -Livery Editor. It has a good livery editor. I made plenty of detailed skins in my time playing the game. It's not the best, but it's pretty good. You can easily make good stuff with it and it's fairly limitless.  -Decent physics. They aren't phenominal and they certainly have their bad moments, but overall the physics are pretty light and fun. Rallycross cars especially are fun to just take on some dirt roads and rip it up with.  -Playability. You can't blow through the entire game in a few days, it does keep you coming back to play more. Money rewards are fairly low to make you work for what you want. The issue being that it takes that to an extreme and ends up becoming a bit tedious and boring. It has enough to keep you coming back, but maybe a bit too much.  Would I reccomend this game? No. Not anymore. I would and have reccomended the game to many people and friends since it came out in 2018, but after the last few months of the game's life I cannot support it anymore. Things started falling off in Summer 2020, but The Chase in Nov 2020 sealed it's fate. No longer can I enjoy this game, or advise others to play it. If you *still* want to play it, please do not play the PC version. You will regret it. Buy a console port, like PS4 or Xbox. They are far more stable (but still have issues. I played on PS4 and still had the game crash). I would seriously advise you to save your money, or maybe watch the updates for a few months in hopes that the studio gets their act together and brings the game back to it's glory days of 2019. I hope this review helps at least one person understand that this game is not what it once was, and that their money is better spent elsewhere.  TLDR: The game used to be really good but from Summer 2020 until now it has gotten progressively worse to the point where it's no longer worth playing.

You can't play it anymore, and they need some good reputation at the moment.

43146875,english,0,646910,"PREFACE: If you're wondering why I already have this many hours even though the game just launched hours ago, it is because I purchased the Ultimate Edition, and was able to play 3 days early via Early Access. Also, I put in over 200 hours into the first game of the series on Xbox One, and put in about 20+ hours into Beta for this game. I skipped through everything I was able to do in the Beta, and grinded my way up to Icon, so that I felt I had enough experience to make this review.  GAMEPLAY: This is where this game shines. I thoroughly enjoy the driving in this game. I came into it expecting to hate the boats/airplanes, and thought about ignoring them altogether, but instead I fell in love with them. I refuse to fast travel (except for the parts that I completed in the Beta), but now I find myself boating and/or flying to almost every race. The most important mechanic is the driving, and that feels great. Every vehicle in the game appears to drive differently, and have a unique weight that gives a great feeling to driving.   One of the biggest complaints of the Beta was how you could grind the rails and not lose any speed whatsoever, but Ubi has seemed to fix that at this point. Being in a vehicle is fun in this game, and that is important, considering that this is a racing game. Rubberbanding is a huge issue though, and detracts from the races themselves. The first title thrived on cross-country races, but what's the point of a 40 minute race, if only the last minute is all that matters? This needs to be sorted out. It almost encourages you to sit behind first place and conserve your nitrous until the last second.  The thing that can make gameplay SO aggravating is the GPS. They completely removed the arrows that you used to be able to follow on top of the screen. Now all you get is the tiny GPS off to the bottom right corner of the screen, and sometimes it can be impossible to follow, especially at extremely fast speeds. Unfortunately, that is not the only problem with the GPS. Half the time it doesn't even work, and just gives you a straight line to the location, and you have no idea how to get where you are going, so opt to fly there.  STORY/CHARACTERS: There is no story. A lot of people thought the story from the first game was quite boring, but was this really the solution for that? The characters serve no purpose, and bring no attachment to who they are. Right now this game is a single-player grind fest. Also, I don't know who did the animations for the characters in the game, but it looks like they hired the BioWare B-Team that did Mass Effect Andromeda. It's bad.  MULTIPLAYER: It is nonexistent. You can hook up with friends and drive around, but that is the ONLY form of multiplayer in the game, besides leaderboards for races. The fact that this game launched without PvP is an insult to the consumer. How can a game possibly be sold as an MMO-lite racer with no PvP? Right now the grind is for nothing, and we have no solid launch date for PvP. If you are looking to do online races, then do not purchase this game yet.  VISUALS: This game is beautiful. But only certain aspects. They nailed the two most important parts of racers, and that is the cars and lighting. The cars look absolutely stunning, and is a huge leap in the right direction for the series, even more than the last game's Wild Run expansion. Ironically, I also noted lighting as looking good. And that's true.....partially. The god rays in this game are among the best I've seen in a vanilla game. The lighting of the sky always captures the mood, and is generally quite gorgeous. Where does the lighting fail? In the headlights. It is IMPOSSIBLE to see in the dark, unless you are in a lit city. The distance of your headlights is a problem the community has raised since the Alpha state, but nothing appears to have been fixed in that area.  The landscapes are quite pretty, but what ruins it are the popins. Yes I have a GTX 1060, but look at any review. This is a problem across all platforms, even for people with 1080 TIs. Ubi has addressed this, saying that it had something to do with the draw distance forced by allowing planes in the game, but in truth, this does nothing but prove that Ubi is acknowledging that their game is not fully optimized, even though it is now launch day. I think it's pretty unacceptable to have a 1080 TI not be able to handle the popins, even when at 1080p.  The water is gorgeous, and is one of the saving graces for the environment. One of the reasons I travel by boat so much in this game is because the water is pretty, unique, fun, and doesn't have all the foliage popins.   The worst part about the graphics in this game are the buildings. They look like Legos, like something out of a game that came in the previous decade. It's so weird having a game that looks so beautiful in some aspects, but absolutely abysmal in others.  AUDIO: The audio in this game has caused a bunch problems for me. The amount of bugs is crazy. Half the time you will hear a car coming up right behind you, only to look behind you and see no one. Also if you crash into objects in the world, there is a bug that repeats the crashing sound on end until you pause the game.   The voice acting is pretty unfortunate. A lot of voices didn't match their faces/animations, and it sounds like Ubi just picked up random people off the street, used a subpar mic, and gave them really bad and cheezy lines to say.  The cars do sound nice, and especially the backfiring of cars can be really satisfying.  The music within the game's radiostations are also much more satisfying than the original game's.  ECONOMY: This game's economy has been VERY inconsistent from the start. Many cars didn't match each other in terms of price, and although they have addressed this slightly, the problem still rings true.  So, is the game P2W? Yeah. It definitely is. Right now, you can purchase a 2nd form of currency, and buy any car you want. I'm not saying microtransactions are the worst thing in the world, but when they are taken further than just cosmetics, I tend to have a problem with it. Right now you can spend extra cash, and compete on the leaderboards with any car in the game from the get-go. Imagine if PvP was actually in this game? Ubi is practically encouraging players to spend money to get everything from the start, and discouraging them from actually even playing the game at all.  VALUE: I'd say it would take the average player about 20 hours to get Icon, and unlock mostly everything in the game. You can get more time of course by grinding out the Icon ranks and such, but I would only see players doing this in prepping for PvP. By using the Dollar per Hour scale, that costs the average consumer about $3 per hour. That's not terrible value, but if this game launched without missing content, you would get much more value per dollar. At least most won't get the Ultimate edition like I did and decrease the value even more.  FINAL THOUGHTS: The Crew launched as a an absolute mess. I don't think that anyone will say otherwise, even Ubisoft. It showed by how much effort they put into resurrecting that game from the dead. They updated the graphics, and also put out two of the best expansions in recent video game history besides the Witcher 3. To me, The Crew launched at about a 4/10. That's how much of a mess that game was. After Ubisoft fixed it, they got it to about an 8.5 in my books. I picked it up for free on Games with Gold, and it quickly became my favorite racing game after all of the expansions. And yes, this is coming from a Forza fanboy. The Crew had a slow start, but eventually gave itself a solid foundation for a sequel. Unfortunately what we got was a game with much better mechanics, yet stripped of all of it's basic content. It is with a heavy heart that I have to give such a bad review of my most anticipated game of the year, that's not named Smash Bros. Ultimate.  VERDICT: 6.5/10  TL;DR: Don't buy yet."
174689773,english,1,646910,"I have a feeling that this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car, and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies. Still worth the price tho, beautiful graphics and racists"
83579628,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is a whisker away from being a great game. You can spend an entire afternoon just enjoying the cars and driving without a specific purpose, while taking in some of the marvelous views, and it feels really good. However, the major downsides - ubiquitous copy-pasting and a rather scant number of genuine innovations  - don't allow me to recommend this game to absolutely everyone -  not just yet.  ⭐⭐⭐✰✰"
153623491,english,0,646910,"Just as a disclaimer, the Crew series is actually not bad, but for anyone who hasn’t noticed this yet, yesterday Ubisoft spontaneously delisted The Crew 1 and also announced that the game will be shutdowned and unplayable after March ’24. Sorry, this is absolutely inexcusable. They tried this with their DLCs last year (but rowed back due to the sh**storm), yet seriously, now this again??!! Don’t get me wrong, The Crew 1 is actually a great game which has quite some single player story content, obviously even an offline mode is integrated hidden in the files (due to some programmers in the community who are working on a mod, see the forum discussions), so there’s obviously no real reason to not give us customers (who paid for all those expensive season passes and DLCs) an offline function. Ubisoft really needs to stop their extremely toxic anti-consumer behavior, because meanwhile even I (I always defended them in the past) am losing interest in their products. And another joke, if you want to complain at the moment, there’s even no official Ubisoft internet forum anymore, only one on Discord (where all discussions get lost anyway). Uggh, sorry, this just had to get out, it’s just super frustrating.   And regarding The Crew 2, yeah, if we tolerate this behavior, The Crew 2 will go the same way, as will probably go a lot of other Ubisoft games with multiplayer online integration."
174895903,english,1,646910,"Alright. [i]The Crew 2[/i]. Judging from the current all-time high concurrent peak player counts for the game, I'd say a lot of people are aware of this game currently being priced at one dollar (and less in some regions). And a lot of people have bought the game as a result of this stunning deal. Including myself. Just to get it out of the way, if you have something to say about The Crew 1's removal, go to the game forum. I'm not interested in the topic as part of this review. So...  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984820  I am confident I would never have bought this game had it not been a buck, and I'm also confident that a lot of people have the same opinion. But since it was a buck, I did in fact buy it, and I'm glad I did. It's hella fun. The gameplay loop of joining events and races, using the cash you earn to buy new vehicles and such, and upgrading your vehicles with loot rewards from events and races, is pretty simple. But it is also effective. As you progress, you will unlock more events and races, and because they are located across the lower 48 States, you get a wide variety of settings for everything. From cities to mountains to forests to lakes to deserts to meteor craters to rain to snow to beaches and on and on, there is a vast array of different types of courses and tracks to enjoy. And there are a wide variety of types of races and events as well. From standard track races to boat races to plane aerobatics to demolition derbies, and so on.  The sheer volume of content is quite impressive. And, the various vehicles, be they cars or trucks or bikes or planes or boats or dune buggies or whatever...they all handle nicely and feel good to drive in. Each of these is upgradeable in many ways, which will increase their performance, handling, speed, and just generally make them function better and better as you progress.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984770  There is a campaign of sorts, where you try to become the lead racer in a few different styles, but it's also easy enough to ignore that in favor of simply racing around, upgrading your vehicles, wandering around your crib, and simply free roaming. And free roaming is a lot of fun in and of itself. Mostly, it's a huge sightseeing trip, where you can also try to beat other player's records with jumps, speed, and so on; that you come across while driving around. And setting some records of your own for other people to beat. And there is a decent photography mini game all across the States where you will take pictures of animals, special vehicles and such to gain more cash and follower.  And gaining followers is really the sub goal that most impacts your playthrough. The number of followers you have determines how popular your racer is, which in turn unlocks new vehicle options and race/event options. Just about everything you do will earn you new followers (and cash).  Also, you can play with other players and even if you're not, you will see them all over the map. At this moment in time (the time of this review being written), no matter where you are, somebody else is nearby. And there are a lot of player created activities as well. Plus, you can co-op with friends if you get bored of solo play. So really, the content just keeps expanding as you explore what the game has to offer.  Visually, the game looks great. It has a 60 FPS cap, which isn't anything to brag about, but somehow, the devs have made the most out of that limitation and made a game that has a never-ending supply of screenshot moments. The audio is also well done. The songs themselves are very cool. The dialogue is basically all ""hey bro"" Extreme Games fodder, but it's fun and definitely appropriate.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3330111663  You will need Ubisoft Connect to play this. I don't care at all about that, but you might. And some people are having an issue with the game crashing if they have other non-Steam clients linked to their Ubi account. I have not had that issue personally and have it linked to both PSN and Epic as well, but if you do, you will need to unlink everything except Steam and that will resolve the crashing issue apparently. No idea how or why that is what it is or why it only affects some players. It's been a bug free experience for me though with a 3070 and an i5.  Now, should you also buy the season pass? I personally have no intention of doing so. There's no new content, and I don't care about getting a few extra cars and some swag. But the base game, offering what can easily be hundreds and even thousands of hours of content for one dollar. That is something I can definitely get behind. I can't think of a better deal in gaming at this moment. Now, if you miss or skip this one-dollar promotion they have going on right now, value will be more of...you know..., a [i]your mileage may vary[/i] type thing....

174302344,english,1,646910,"Forza Horizon fan.  Having fun in Crew 2 with all the different vehicle and event types.  C2 runs smooth, no bugs, and each event type is well designed and implemented.  Only frustration, I did not reach Platinum division in the Summit my first week. Being rich in Forza means you can buy and tune a competitive vehicle.  In Crew 2, you buy the base vehicle, but you have to grind for upgrade parts.   FH has classes (B, A, S1, S2).  C2 does not.  All vehicles of same type in C2 have same max tune value. FH no Nitro, C2, Nitro is primary factor. C2, no Auction House nor any way to sell vehicles. C2, leaderboards are more integral, and are a focus of endgame/seasons (Summit). I have over 700 vehicles in FH5.  In C2 earning vehicles is a MUCH slower process, and so far, I don't see much incentive to collect cars, beyond appearance and Summit requirements.  Do different Street Race cars handle differently at max stats??  excluding part affixes and awd."
43308733,english,0,646910,"If I had to sum up this game in one word, that word would be ""inconsistent"". The core racing experience is fun, and the open-world is still a thrill to just fly, race and drift around. However, there are definetly some irks that hold it back:  ""That's solid? really?"" - you'll find yourself saying this a fair bit, unfortunately. Whilst bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts and even traffic fold up like they're made of crisps and ping off into space, trees and parked cars are merciless, utterly solid, and occasionally placed exactly where you think you can get that little shortcut.  The AI: Rubberband doesnt even sum the AI up. In fact, it's barely worth trying to drive fast, as they will ALWAYS catch up to you and press their hidden hyperspace buttons the second you overcook a corner. Incredabily frustrating sometimes when you've been in the lead for 95% of the race, then get taken out by a suprise bus on the last corner and finish stone-dead last. Hard mode races up the challenge significantly, but dont be surprised to see the AI disappear over the draw distance within 10 seconds of the start if you havn't grinded out those upgrades for your vehicles.  The Story: If I had to guess, I'd say The Crew 2 was designed to be faaaar more ambitious in it's storytelling. The cutscenes and dialogue you get occasionally before or after a race feel really disjointed, as if there's a big chunk of the story you missed somewhere. One place it particularly confised me was one of the Rival races, where suddenly the mentor who's been urging you on all this time suddenly heel turns so rapidly it's surprising he doesnt do himself an injury, and opens a cutscene by telling your mechanic, Hiro, that you've somehow betrayed him and he wants a race... by doing what he wanted you to and winning races... huh? It just made me confused. Add to this the artsy cutscenes full of pseudo-philosophical commentary that honestly makes zero sense to pop up when they do, and overall the impression that there was a lot of story removed that might have linked these sections together can't be ignored.  There is a lot of good though. The racing is fun, the sensation of speed is excellent, the environments (especially out in the countryside with deserts and the Grand Canyon) are gorgeous and run well, and it really shines when you're just having fun in the open world. Just not in Monster Trucks. Never Monster Trucks. They just... no. horrible.  To sum up, there is a huge amount of potential here. It just needs filling out, and as such in it's present state I can't really recommend it for full price. Maybe after a few updates, it will start to fulfil it's potential. So who made this game again? Oh. Ubisoft. Don't count on the potential being filled then."

43274957,english,0,646910,"Disgusting rubberbanding makes the game so un-enjoyable. Race perfectly and the ai will be right behind you the entire time even if your vehicle is 50 points faster. Of course it's the same the other way around as well, you can eat shit in a ditch and be right behind the leader of the race 10 seconds later because they basically slow down to a crawl if you fall behind, which is incredible because as soon as you pull ahead of them by 5-6 seconds the ai can start to take perfect turns going twice as fast as you like the car is on rails instead of tires. Even worse is the fact that the game punishes you for using your breaks. It's legitimately faster to ride the side rail of a corner and hold the boost than to bother to slow down and take a proper turn.  PSA: I'm honestly super surprised I actually have to explain this here but to everyone commenting about the problem being connection or cpu or w/e else, rubberbanding ai is not a term for lagging. Rubber band AI refers to a feature of artificial intelligence found in racing titles that is designed to prevent players from getting too far ahead of computer-controlled opponents.   Edit: I'm making a sidenote for all the people who are real grumpy about the bad reviews, the base of the game itself is nice. It feels great to freeroam around the map. The physics could have used a bit more tuning but aside from that the cars control as you would expect from a good arcade racer. The problem lies beyond that in the ai. The oponents can decide to hit warpspeed to catch up to you whenever they damn well please. It's not as obvious in disciplines like hypercar racing and the F1 syle discipline, but street races are absolutely atrocious to play. I honestly believe if Ubi went back and fixed some of their problems the game could be great, but as it is, it feels like a big mess. Also, always online game and no PvP for another 5-6 months is a pathetic joke."

Even if The Crew 2 is a good game, I recommend you not to buy until ubisoft release an offline patch and show some respect to players.

50261820,english,0,646910,"I played the game in 4k on a 3080 with an XBOneX Pro controller. All detail was maxed except AA and blur. I do not recommend a keyboard and mouse.  PLEASE NOTE, even though I have left comments on, I am not interested in you telling me that I should put 4000 hours into a game I don't enjoy so I can ""git good"", and then I would like it. That is a stupid argument. Don't be stupid. Skill is not indicative of enjoyment, and I have better things to do than bash my head on what I personally feel are bad / mediocre games on the off chance I could maybe like them one day. I have a life and don't play games to develop Stockholm syndrome.  Neutrals: - There are 25-minute single races. In an arcade racing game. I hated this. You may not.  Pros: - Most of the time, it ran at 60 FPS. - Large map, but...  Cons: - There is little to see on the map that's interesting. Sometimes the trees change type, and maybe there's more water in an area. - The upgrade system is painfully bad and is essentially a lootbox minus a box. You win a race, you get some random upgrades. You can have, say, LVL 65 in every part but one and it may take you 20 races to get an upgrade for that slot. Yes, you can get RNG'd into having to grind races to upgrade. It's as bad as it sounds. - VERY hard to read tracks when racing. Sometimes you'll just go in the wrong direction because you have no clue where you are intended to go. You essentially have to watch the minimap because watching the race itself is useless as the tracks are signposted more poorly than any other racing game I've played in recent memory. - The AI is tuned incredibly poorly. Either they're WAY ahead of you even though you're driving a better car and the race is half your level, or you're absolutely demolishing them. There is no adjusting this. It is infuriating. - All the cars control like they're racing on butter. Everything slides uncontrollably and really shows off how shoddy the physics are in this game. You will constantly careen into stuff. And speaking of... - Hitting damn near anything brings you to a complete stop. You don't slide past stuff like other arcade racing games when the corner of your car clips a bush, you come to a complete halt. You now have to restart the race because you WILL NOT catch up. Is the race 12 minutes long? Too bad. Now to find that race reset... - The menus are awful. I had to actually Google how to restart a race and quit the game. Thought they'd be in the in-game menus? Hah, you simpleton! You have to hit Y to bring up a special menu that hides in the corner of the screen, but only comes up while driving! Want that menu on a keyboard & mouse? NOPE! Those buttons sometimes show up at the bottom of a different menu where you may have expected them in the first place! Well, sometimes. Only when the option for the buttons feels like appearing. Sometimes it just doesn't. - The characters are astoundingly annoying and are written to speak like a Red Bull commercial. The overtly positive ""might as well be saying nothing at all"" style garbage non-speaking flows out of everyone's mouth continually. The story is non-existant. If you love chasing ""followers"" (ugh), then go on Instagram and be vapid there. Even the shell of a life you pretend to have there will be more fun than The Crew 2. - Very odd and frequent framerate drops when physics items interact with each other. This happens often. Adjusting settings did not help. - It looks worse than the original did somehow, and the first was quite an ugly game. - One of the worst game soundtracks I've heard since Gone Home. This low-budget mess of a soundtrack complete with incredibly shrill lady-punk songs. The only good song on the soundtrack is Airbourne - Running Wild, and it's over 10 years old. Yes that's an opinion, and your mileage may vary. - I am an idiot and preordered the Gold Edition because, hey, this is a sequel. It's going to improve on the original in many ways. (Narrator: ""It did not."") They didn't listen to a single damn complaint about the original, even though nearly every review both professional and amateur said the same things (Many of which are pointed out in my review here). This makes me madder. You couldn't even be bothered to fix the obvious? Bad form, Ubisoft. - They haven't improved on any of these complaints since launch and instead insist on putting out boring Live Events. This is because Live games make more money (See Destiny). Make no mistake, this is a product, not art and it definitely wants all of your money. - I genuinely tried to like it and power through some of the issues, but I just can't any more. I hate this game. It is one of the worst racing games I have played in recent memory. Even the two most recent Need For Speed games were better, and they were mediocre at the best of times.  UPDATE: Tried it again several years down the road. Holy god there is so much seasonal crap slathered everywhere, and random things to level that they're trying to sell you it was nearly impossible to figure out what to do next. This somehow got even grosser than it was. Oh, and even though the menus have changed, they now make LESS sense due to the sheer amount of layered-on garbage that, AND I still couldn't find a way to quit. I had to Alt + F4."
43211268,english,0,646910,"This game is an improvement over the first one which I defended to be honest. The addition of planes and boats was a great one.  However, I won't give this game a postiive review because Ubisoft intentionally downgraded the game. By that I speak of landmarks. Of all the landmarks they had in The Crew 1, they were all very accurate in terms of shape and relative location. They even had the same ones in the E3 demo. But they decided to remove a lot of them or make them inaccurate for no good reason. If it is a technical reason, it is pure lazyness on the devs part and they jusst used a cheap dirty workaround to fix an issue they had.  I am quite disappointed with the map downgrades. I feel that rather than removing the landmarks, they should have created accurate new ones to further enhance the cities. I will admit the random buildings do look better in this game but the lack of landmarks irritates me.    -In New York the Metlife building, Yankee Stadium, Chrysler Building etc were removed, and the Empire State building was replaced with an inaccurate model. -In Detroit the bridge crossing over to Candida was removed. -In Los Angeles, the City Bank building was altered and is no longer accurate. -The military base north of Chicago was removed. -Downgrades made which decrease the detail to the Hoover Dam  Now Chicago, my home town, got hit hard by the pointless downgrading. About 70 percent of the landmarks were removed. -Sears Tower was removed (Even non Chicago natives will notice this one. Bad decision. Makes me wonder what is wrong with the dev/designer who thought that was a good idea.) -Thompson Center was removed -LaSalle Street Metra was station removed -United Center is gone -Solder Field is gone -The Diamond Building is also gone -The airport was removed (REALLY BAD choice giving the fact the game now has airplanes) -The accurate recreation of Navy Pier was replaced by a bunch of the random filler buildings and props you see all over the map. They are munched together like some kid would make if the game had some kind of map editor which let you place buildings. -The curved building where the river forks was removed. (Forgot the name) -Skyscraper directly south of Sears Tower removed (Also forgot the name) -The Chase Bank building is gone.   What makes me mad is that it is the same map as the first game. You will get a better US road trip experiance in The Crew 1 as the cities featured actually look like the way they are supposed to. They intentionally downgraded it. This game has good gameplay, but screwing up the map makes me belive this game is incomplete and therefore doesn't get a positive review. I'll change my review when Ubisoft restores the content they removed intentionally.  Once Ubisoft corrects their dumb mistakes and gives us the United States road trip experiance that The Crew 1 had, I will change my review."

50314368,english,0,646910,"Crew 2 was controversial at start and ran out of content in 3 months, lost its playerbase in 5 months, Season Pass has been nothing but a scam. About year after launch, big update comes with three new cars (wow!) and MICROTRANSACTIONS (they are only cosmetic and premium currency can be obtained in some ways but donating is much easier). It's Ubisoft, remember, no fun allowed. Even the first Crew had a better potential of holding playerbase with different bodykits to all cars and good crate system even considering the fact that it wasn't at release. Honestly, whole economic system in Crew 2 is messed up, money are really hard to get and best cars cost horribly high, even though $1,4kk car can show similar or even worse performanse than $350k due to ""pro settings"" and parts which you can switch between cars of the same class and which define the most of car's stats, all you're buying is basically a skin with some advantages (base stats are slightly different nonetheless). Open-world activities are ok, but not profitable, and not all races are profitable as well. There are a lot of them, and developers even add some every now and then, but the main problem is that you are granted with no rewards by completing certain percentage of all races in one class, so there is no point completing all of them - you only get vehicle reward after you beat any story boss, but all you get is mediocre car and trash helicopter which you can't even use in a race. It's easier to find a good relaxing race and farm money there 'till you faint and it seems that it's what most players do. I can't feel a soul in Crew 2. Making matters worse, it's just fucking tedious and grind-based mediocre car game. This vomitous scheme ""Grind money to get a better car to grind more money using it"". No immersion effect (as in FH4), bad car handling and collision physics, terrible optimisation with painful launches and many, many other bad things. It's year after, not the release date state. When hearing news about Ubisoft making a live-service you should await a death-service."
43572491,english,0,646910,"As I played about 200+ hours in The Crew 1 I have to admit that in The Crew 2 I got bored after 20 hours already.  So let's talk about the things:  1. Price - way too much for this game. Wait for a sale if you REALLY want to play it BADLY. I didn't have fun when playing this game, which shocked me though, because The Crew 1 brought me so much fun. Very disappointing.  2. Map - landmarks are gone, they kinda replaced it with Photo Albums, which is not that bad, however it's kinda annoying (at least for me). Map is huge, but feels totally empty and unused, since they took fast travel to random places away and the map is unlocked, since the beginning, so not much of a grind to be fair. 3. AI - feels really weird sometimes. Sometimes it works normally and sometimes it's just impossible. I had the most issues with Drag Racing where I actually had to watch tutorials to have a chance to beat someone on normal (and no i'm not a total noob, the timing is just so crucial that you need to learn it, which is ridiculous). For beginners the AI is way too OP. If you new and want to have fun you will get frustrated really quickly.  4. Vehicles - probably the biggest plus in this game. There's a wide range of cars, etc., however, with all the classes (boats, planes) it doesn't feel like a REAL racing game anymore. 5. Story - Overall cringe atmosphere, a forced ""legal"" environment with big parties all over the freaking country. All nice places, which I enjoyed in The Crew 1 just for the nature are now covered with stupid banners and fancy lights, etc. etc. which takes the feeling away. The whole ""story"" is just a collection of short events, which are apparently huge in the so called TV.  6. Miscellaneous - The followers are replacement of the XP, which is not tragic, but probably annoyed many players who played TC1. The stupid chants after every race or completed skill and music is just annoying.   Overall it's a huge disappointment, there's not much room for grind. I completed all the races for all categories + all skills on 100 % in about 20 hours. I could do the photo albums and buy all vehicles, but the game is just not fun.  If you're new and you want to give it a try wait for a sale. If you're a passioned racing gamer or you played The Crew 1 don't buy this game. That's my OWN OPINION."
43432845,english,0,646910,"Pros: 1. Graphics are ok, but could have been better for a 2018 game. 2. Good car selection and upgrades.  Cons:  1. Cringeworthy voice acting and poorly made cutscenes. 2. Car handling feels like you are driving on snow. 3. Poor wheel support, at least they tried to improve it though. 4. Story is nonexistent, feels like they put a random plot on the last stages of the game. 5. Landmarks from the first game are gone. 6. AI is awful. 7. Map is huge but feels so empty, also the game unlocks the entire map by default so the game don't give you a reason to explore it.  Resuming: Not worth the full price, buy it in a sale and hope you have some fun with it.  FOR THOSE WHO SAY I ONLY PLAYED 0.8HRS OF THE GAME I played the beta on UPlay and my playtime says I have 6 hours on it. It's basically the same game."
43673830,english,0,646910,"[b]What it is:[/b] A massive open-world driving game that boasts the greatest map ever made in its genre but is screaming for more polish in virtually every aspect.  [b]What it does well:[/b] [list] [*]That map - a 1:40 scale recreation of the United States lifted from the original game but updated to accommodate essentially every type of motorized mobility with unparalleled variety [*]A genuinely liberating sense of freedom from a game structured to reward you for doing virtually anything in any vehicle anywhere (except for the PvP) [*]The [i]second[/i]-best game on the planet for relaxation behind Microsoft Flight Simulator - The Crew 2 is at its best not when you're racing but when you're treating it as a giant high-speed walking simulator with no story to speak of [*]An amusingly varied vehicle list that goes from the usual genre staples to things like a biplane, a helicopter, a hovercraft, and more [*]An equally varied array of activity types to engage in - including drift and drag races, aerial stunt challenges, monster truck arenas, demolition derbies, and more [*]A great photo mode held back only by the game's own visual inconsistencies [*]The weekly summits provide a fairly compelling reason to regularly revisit the game to do more than just cruise and chill out [*]Free updates for 29 months and counting [/list]  [b]What it fluffs:[/b] [list] [*]Despite already having hundreds of races in the game, the map still feels underused with loads of unused open spaces and roads [*]No open-world PvP races - a feature that existed in 2007's Test Drive Unlimited [*]No open-world or multiplayer police chases [*]A loot system that seems to be entertaining and somewhat addictive at first, but eventually proves to be generally pointless outside of some top-tier gear sets [*]The environments feel really dated now the second you stop to look, and both draw distance and LOD handling could use an improvement [*]As of late 2020, nights are [i]still[/i] ""broken"" by design and way too bright due to the developers' inability to properly implement car headlights [*]Strange vehicle physics engine that still doesn't know how to handle collisions convincingly [*]A cheating AI that relies only on stupid levels of rubberbanding to stay competitive [*]Strange UI/UX decisions - chief among them the refusal to save your location upon quitting the game and always forcing you to start each session either at home or an HQ [*]This game has an exceptional number of vehicle types for you to enjoy, but the number of vehicles available in each type is actually pretty underwhelming [*]Horrible story and writing with the only saving grace being how easily they can all be ignored [*]The updates may be free, but content is delivered as a painfully slow drip feed and a lot of the ""new"" cars are just reskins of the old ones [*]Paywalled seasonal content that doesn't seem to offer any real value [/list]  [b]Technical stuff:[/b] [list] [*]Disappointingly capped at 60fps like its predecessor, but it stays locked at 60fps quite easily too [*]Tons of environmental graphical assets that look like they're from 15 years ago if you stop to look and yet still pass for good looking when you're rolling by at 320km/h [*]Almost complete ultrawide support - HUD and UI are not stretched but remain confined to 16:9 screen space [*]Occasional minor connectivity issues [*]For some reason may become unstable when played with a Bluetooth controller [*]If you have two controllers connected to your PC (e.g. Xbox pad and flight stick), remove one before you start playing because this game idiotically takes input from all devices simultaneously [/list]  [b]Recommendation:[/b] The Crew 2 does do the basics right, but none of those basics can compete with what's on offer in Forza Horizon titles. You're basically here for the map or nothing else, and even that amazing map remains underutilized. The graphics engine appears in need of an overhaul as some serious issues involving pop-in and brightness at night remain unsolved almost two years after launch. It's a good buy for those who loved the first Crew - and its spiritual predecessors, the two Test Drive Unlimited games - and no one else."
45881599,english,1,646910,a decent casual open world racing game. recommended for people looking for such an experience.  pros - huge open world.entire map of usa slightly scaled down to explore. you can have a big road trip on your own or with friends. vehicle variety - the game is not limited to cars alone but boats planes and bikes as well. lots of different racing disciplines - ranging from street racing to grand prix to moto cross and rally cross. also featured is a cross country hyper car race - goes from east coast to west coast.40 minutes for a single lap race covering the entire width of usa. a great experience in itself. leisurely driving across the grand canyon or other such iconic places has its own novelty. acquiring the cars and upgrading them is satisfying. the set races are well made. snow and rain look nice. graphically the game is good but not upto the standards of other modern racing games like forza  cons -  game is completely arcadish with 0 damage functionality and the physics are very simplistic.its not meant for realistic racing at all. no real pvp features yet (there is an update in the works but no idea how or what it will be)
118350135,english,1,646910,Let me start this off by saying if you only plan on playing with a controller go for it which is why i'm recommending it ONLY if you're using a controller   If you have a sim rig or even just a basic setup with a wheel you will be extremely disappointed. The force feedback literally makes no sense. You'll be taking a corner and when the rear end slightly slips out from under you the force feedback just decides to fu*k off in a direction that makes no sense. There's an insane amount of options missing that would be in any racing game whether it's an arcade racer or sim with wheel support.   Next issue is the fact that for everyone on PC you are limited to 60 fps with no work around.....like...WHAT!?!? Iv'e literally never played a game on PC that limited my frames to that of a console. What was the thought process behind this decision?   Interface controls moving around the map with a wheel is extremely frustrating but you can get used to it  I have to scroll through every single wheel till I find the ones I want as there are no filter options unless I missed something but come on guys   On the vehicle selection screen there's these flashy light things grazing across the car tabs and is super annoying / makes it hard to see what you're looking at  Some of the cars wheels maximum size still are too small and makes the tires look like they should be on a rally car  Just because we have a sim rig doesn't mean we are limited to sim racers. Sometimes we just want to screw around in an open world environment and zone out which Horizon is great for but that's literally all we have and every NFS title with wheel support is probably even worse than this  In the end if your game is going to have wheel support why even bother having it in the game if you're not gonna do it right?
168231015,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 is a fairly good game but it's just a matter of time until ubisoft decides to pull the plug on this one, just like they did with the original Crew, If buying is not owning then piracy is not stealing."
103655459,english,0,646910,"This game is max quantity, zero quality. If you told me this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies, it would all make sense. Then they added rpg elements with rng based loot. This is a parody of a driving game through the lens of the onion.  For example: this has time trial races with tiered time targets: easy, normal and hard. Let's say your brain is broken like me and you accept the challenge to 100% this game and learn the absurd and downright comical driving model which induces even hypercars to lift their inside rear tyre like a civic on hard turn in. Lets say you can easily beat the hard time with a stock car. You still gotta run the race 2 more times to complete it to get rewards. Every stupid race has to be done thee times. Every. Single. Event. This is just one among numerous issues.  Every single thing other than car customization is the commitee voting for the worst possible option every single time. Its like if twitch plays racing game development with assholes. Just don't buy this microtransaction hell. Even if this goes free to play. Don't be me."
115958990,english,1,646910,"OK.  I'm going to write this as someone who has been a huge fan of The Crew franchise.  The short answer is, ""Yes.  I'd recommend this game.""  The longer answer is a little more nuanced and if you'd like to read a few ""caveats"" from someone who still enjoys the game, mostly......please proceed.  I have played this game since launch.  I owned the ""Gold Edition"" on PS4 and logged A LOT of hours there.  I then made the switch to PC and, as you can see, I've logged over 200 more hours on here.  There are a lot of positives that any number of other reviews will also bring up.  There are also a lot of negatives, many of which are not immediately apparent.  And here is where I am going to bring these up.  They weren't severe enough for me to not recommend the game, but they were important enough for me to mention.  1.  No cross-platform support or cross-play (not too concerned about cross-play though)  It's one thing to not offer this.  It's another to have very specific rewards for completing certain events and not allow people who earned those rewards to carry them over (or even allow them to use MTX to buy them back on your new platform).  Don't get me wrong, if they asked me to pay money for items I already earned; I'd tell them to get bent.  However, this business model here actively discourages people from buying the game on more than one platform.  Seems stupid.  I have numerous cars earned from PS4 Summit, but because my Uplay account is logged in to a steam version of the game instead of a PS4 version of the game......I can't use them.  2.  It's pitched as ""any vehicle, anywhere, any time""  No.  It's not.  Sure, there are plenty of events and lots of different vehicles, but the lion's share of events and vehicles fall in to ""street race"".  There are more ""street race"" events than all the other ""Street HQ"" events combined.  There are more hypercars and street race cars than any other class except for MAYBE Rally Raid and Touring Car.  I don't mind these events/vehicles, but it would be nice to get something else.  It's especially bad for Summit as most ""special vehicle rewards"" are just another street spec or hypercar spec.  The ""Xtreme Series"" (one of the more unique aspects of the game) has less than ten events and that's after they added some.  3.  It's ""grindy"".  Again, clearly I don't mind the grind, but I'd be lying if I said a large majority of my time spent wasn't re-running the same handful of events for cash and parts.  The RNG is hell sometimes and certain vehicle types just get aggravating to get parts for.    For example.  I own full legendary part sets on every single hypercar I own.  I managed to do this in about a week simply re-running the New York hypercar event,  It nets about 300,000 bucks on Ace and yields a BUNCH of legendary parts.  The event is a long cross-country event and takes around 30 min to complete.  Simple enough.  Jump on, run it once or twice, net cash and parts.  But outside hypercars (and one or two street race events) there aren't any events like this for the other specs.  This is ESPECIALLY egregious, because they had stuff like that in the first Crew.  It would be nice if there was a better way of earning legendary sets without relying on Summit or getting to Icon 1000+ to dump a bunch of points in to buffing your loot quality and amount.    4.  ""Vanity Parts"" and ""Premium Currency""  I have an issue with ""pay to customize"", especially on a game where customizing is a key component to that experience.  It's one thing to pay $5 to have a gold gimp suit or some such crap on Battlefield or CoD.  It's another to have these ""pay parts"" on a game all about customizing.  It's made worse by the ""Season Passes"" having a ""regular"" and a ""premium"" version and even the premium pass doesn't net you enough Crew Credits to buy an epic vanity part.  You get a couple extra vehicles (probably another street spec or hypercar).  I mostly bring this up because they used to gift Crew Credits a bunch more and just by saving up a bit, you could put them to use in amazing ways and made you WANT to play.  5.  The ""Online"" Experience.  It's not great.  It's better than a lot I've seen, but it's still pretty bad.  I've had invites from all kinds of people,  almost none that actually want to do events.  You join someone's crew, you screw around on the map until someone gets bored.  Someone joins YOUR crew, they quit as soon as they realize you're starting an event.  Maybe it's time.  Maybe it's the platform.  I can't say for sure.  I CAN say, the social experience WAS better when I was on PS4.  Last but not least, this isn't Forza.  If you're expecting Forza, then buy Forza.  This is more akin to the GOOD Need for Speeds from back in the day (i.e. Most Wanted, Carbon, Underground).  The physics aren't great, but they aren't horrible.  It's mostly just designed to goof off with and have a good time......not recreating what driving a Bugatti is like.  If nothing I said dissuaded you, then give it a try.....and if you see me around, shoot me an invite.  Just don't be afraid of doing something."

Someone without dogshat taste in music is possibly still trapped at Ubisoft. We need to do all we can to rescue this person from their descent to french hell.   Which is a lot like normal hell but much more bougie & smelly."
140621252,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is an open world arcade racing game with the map being the literal entire USA, downscaled to videogame size obviously. Also, i'm hyped for Motorfest even though i'll have to wait another year because Ubisoft, once again, decided to go to Epic Games. They already did come back crawling because Epic didn't work as good as they thought and yet here we are looking at them doing the exact same mistake again missing out on tons of sales because of the selling platform ONLY. Anyways.  I have done every single peace of Content this game has to offer, from races to photo ops but ""skills"" too and i can tell you i hated almost everything about this game; special hate goes out to every single Boat and Plane activity. I loved playing it, i mean it made me play for 200h+ but i will not ignore how bad of a videogame it actually is  People complain about the Crew 2 but i think its for the wrong reasons; most of the critism is about the grindy aspect of this game and yes they are right it indeed is one of the grindiest racing games ever but to be absolutely honest.. i bought a racing game to win races, if the grind is based on racing then why would i complain? anyways, theres seemingly endless content to be played, most of it feels either the same or really really alike but i really appreciate the cheer amount of content Ivory Tower came up with, set peaces and special events really look and feel cool to go through but it is obvious that most of it were simple instagram filters being put onto your screen to make it feel different even if it mostly isn't.  Graphics are OKAY, it does look outdated compared to even older titles and the antialasing is basically non existent, the backmirrors do not work and your headlights are literally looking like transparent yellow JPGs to make it look like there was light but it actually is no light source at all inside the game engine, the steering wheel barely moves at higher speeds. It definetily has its moments though, it can look pretty and sometimes i had more NFS Underground Vibes than the past 5 Need for Speeds were able to get me but the fact the night time got literally massacred in order to cover up non functioning headlights really bothers me  Heres what i think is important to know before getting into it Anything you do, wether it be menu navigation or real time gameplay, it feels like a mobile game with PC features. Theres so many decisions made in design which simply go all against the user experience to make it as annyoing and uncomfortable as possible and i will have to give you a couple examples to make some sense of what i actually mean:   Every time you finish a race theres an unskippable animation playing telling you that you won, how much XP you got and how much money you earned, it takes almost 10 seconds every single time, right after that you'll see some funny colorfull packages spawning in front of your car so you collect them, these are literally random generated tuning parts which also have (feelingly) hundreds of additional passive effects besides pushing the cars perfomance. Once your inventory is full and you tuned up your car, you gotta dismantle the stuff you don't need and that.. takes way too much time. I could guess that 1/3 of my playtime was dismantling tuning parts only. This entire process is what you get for playing the game. The Tuning is based on RPG NUMBERS and STATS, its no new super duper new engine you build into your car, its literally the same thing now being purple instead of blue (rarity=quality) and the number goes up from 245 to 247.  Other than that the Visual Freedom of your car is astonishingly huge, less for the GT and Hyper Classes but more than ever in street race cars, generally the car selection is almost as impressive as Forzas is.  The AI in your races also base their difficulty on those RPG like ""Perfomance Numbers"", meaning your car has to have a ""220-Stat"" to be able to compete in that specific race; this system leads to the AI being either entirely broken or not existent at all. One side of the game makes you want to own as many cars and have as much variety as possible, on the other side theres really obvious differences in cars in same classes. Almost every Muscle Car feels underpowered as hell while other ""meta-cars"" will have no problems whatsoever; Some cars really do struggle a ton to keep up with the AI, others will make you simply drive the course to the finish line making it a personal time trial.  But wait! theres more! The Crew 2 has an RPG like Skill Tree. It enhanced passive things like ""slipstream power"", range, effectiveness, it enhanced your nitrous in 7 different ways and makes competing against other lower level people a joke; actually the PVP section of this game is dead since release because of the slipstream mechanic which is absolute BS, you can literally hear your car gaining +100HP as you drive behind your mate. This is a racing game, no MMORPG and most certainly no MOBA, i genuinenly do not understand how one could implement such things into a racing game, making a skill set almost obsolete (of course you still have to know how to drive lol)  Also, there is an ingame real-money shop for you to buy cosmetics, car bundles and battle pass though you can buy the battle pass with ingame money you get from playing  On the plus side though, i really like how easy accessable the multiplayer is. You invite your friend to the party, you choose a race and there you go, no overcomplicated crap needed for this.  I love playing this game but i seriously hate everything that comes with it. In sale for less than 15 bucks, its a good deal for the amount of content you get."
57370276,english,1,646910,"If you've played the first game, then there is some returning stuff that you're already familiar with. The big-ass map, the various racing categories, [b]the grinding[/b], the fact that you'll most likely never own all the vehicles.  Pros: - Planes and boats are fun, the quick vehicle swap function too. - The loot system has been improved (unless you really liked to grind for hours for each car individually). Parts can be exchanged within the category, meaning that you'll get new parts based on the highest parts you own, for any vehicle of the same category. You can buy a brand new, vanilla car, and just install maxxed out parts you already own. - Live Summit events are good.  Mids: - The ""you own one car and can outfit it for several categories"" system got scrapped. You just own a car for a specific category. Maybe it's also available in a different category, maybe it's not. - The ""story"" and most characters. At this point, they should just give up the narrative part. Nobody cares, and it's not very interesting. The issue is that it's an arcade game whose very scope makes it hard to explain stuff (you're not going to be surprised by an NFS game being about illegal street racing, but how do you justify the plethora of vehicles available in the Crew? Well... maybe you shouldn't.)  Cons: - Hiro and most in-race announcers and commentary. Gets old reeeaaaal fast. - Just like in the Crew 1, the driving experience can rank from pleasant to extremely frustrating and clunky. - Can take a while to get into a PvP race due to the player population and the waiting system sucks (being able to join ""on-call"" à la GTAO would be great). - Having to actually go into HQs or your house and walk around to perform actions. Who's got time for that? Why can't I just do it from the menus? - Speaking of the menus... Pointless animations, loading times... And the submenu for the radio that also contains race-related options. That shit is whack.  So, is this a transcending experience? Nah. But it can be fun. Get it if you liked the first one, or if you wanna play with friends.  1) Stay away [u]2) Recommended when on sale or for a specific audience[/u] 3) Recommended 4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must play"
43232418,english,0,646910,"So much AI Rubberbanding it's not even funny, Cringeworthy dialogue, Poor vehicle handling, Microtransactions. Wait for Forza Horizon 4."
43416459,english,0,646910,"If you want to buy this because you think it improved from The Crew 1 keep your money. I couldnt even get a refund even though Iv explained to support how cheap this game is. They used the more than 2 hours of play excuse, I had 4 at the time and thats counting all the cinematics, you basically cant see how cheap it is before passing the 2 hours mark. Keep your money."
54748485,english,1,646910,"After 50 hours, The Crew 2 has left me with a lot of wonderful memories. They aren't filled with the kind of emergent stories you get from exploring an open world and its systems, nor are they moments that involve goofing around with strangers--The Crew 2 is lacking in both those aspects. Instead, my memories are filled with the game's variety of vehicular activities and the wonderfully curated tracks: the unrealistic, the impossible, and the delightful.  It's surprising to see just how much The Crew 2 differs from the original game. There's been a noticeable shift in Ubisoft’s last few open-world titles, one that's moving toward a focus on player-driven progression--large selections of optional activities, non-linear structures, rewards for doing just about anything--and The Crew 2 benefits significantly from this direction. The gritty crime angle from the original game is gone, and instead, The Crew 2 takes reams of pages from the book of Forza Horizon. The game centers on a nationwide festival of motorsports where you, a rookie, are poised to become the next big star. While the setup is conventional, and the focus on social media fame is obnoxious, what it brings to the game is a colorful and upbeat vibe, an impressive variety of different disciplines, and positively ridiculous arcade driving on land, water, and through the air.  Despite the game's focus on real-world branding and mimicry of televised motorsports, The Crew 2's greatest asset is its willingness to be ridiculous. Races in The Crew 2 might involve jumping your street-racing car off skyscrapers, or your powerboat off the Hoover Dam. They might include making high-speed touring cars go head to head through the tight, windy Hollywood Hills, and motocross bikes take jumps across shipping freighters and freeways right before you transform into a prop plane like some kind of extreme-sports mecha. This is a game that will cover Los Angeles in three feet of snow for no logical reason other than icy roads make for more thrilling street races. Abundant nitro boosts, uncomplicated drifting, and generous rubber-banding also help keep the act of driving exciting when things are relatively tame.  As a game with an open world, races and challenges can naturally be found and initiated when you stumble across them at particular points on the map. However, playing The Crew 2 with open-world exploration as your primary means of moving from activity to activity reveals the game's major downfall: it's too big, and all the activities and interesting locations are too spread out. The game hides a number of boxes with vehicle components across the map, which you can hunt for using a proximity tracker, but even these feel too few and far between.  But with that in mind, The Crew 2 thankfully makes it easy to cut your commute down via player-friendly shortcuts. The game has an option to view all 120+ primary activities and countless more skill challenges (featuring things like escapes, slaloms, and a rewarding photo mode) in a categorized, list-style view, with the option to not just set a waypoint to them, but instantly start them no matter where you are in the world, at no cost. The loading times in The Crew 2 are impressively brief all around, so if you want to, you can churn through races and challenges back-to-back to very quickly and efficiently rack up progression points, earn cash, and set leaderboard positions from the moment you start.  It's an option that's both convenient and gives the impression that the game is conscious of your time. Likewise, any activity can be restarted or aborted in seconds if you're having a bad run, and there's a quick back-on-track feature that can be used any time. When you're not in an event you can switch to any vehicle you own immediately, without penalty, and without having to go anywhere. That's on top of being able to assign a favorite ground vehicle, boat, and plane to your right analog stick to allow for instantaneous switching during free-roam exploration, which provides its own kind of fun, for example, flying into the stratosphere with your plane before switching to a boat and careening back to Earth. Any vehicle that's available for sale is also graciously available for you to test drive on a moment's notice.  The variety of different vehicular disciplines in The Crew 2 is downright impressive--each of the 14 styles is tangibly unique from one another. Every time I started to get fatigued with one method of competition, I could quickly jump to another that had a completely different feel. Each is housed within one of four ""Families"" which you're free to move between to perpetuate your overall progress: Street (street racing, drifting, drag racing, long-distance hypercar racing), Offroad (cross-country rally raid, motocross, loose-surface rallycross), Freestyle (plane aerobatics, jet sprint boating, monster trucking), and Pro (power boating, air racing, touring cars, and grand prix).  While the execution of The Crew 2's disciplines might not wholly satisfy purists of any one given style, it does a great job of making each feel accessible, fun, and unique. I'm usually too intimidated by grand prix racing to give it a shot in other games, and I would never have even considered the idea of playing a power boating game. But, the Crew 2 encourages you to try a little bit of everything, and it's easy thanks to the game's approachable arcade-style mechanics, as well as the prospects of seeing more beautiful and ludicrous tracks.  And whether you're driving, boating, or flying across The Crew 2's America, it's a mostly beautiful journey. The game's natural environments, particularly bodies of water and the sky, look fantastic, as do weather effects like snow and rain. All are enhanced to breathtaking heights by the superb lighting, though the continuous day/night and weather cycle can be an occasional inconvenience during some events--whether it be afternoon sun in your eyes, snow obscuring track obstacles, or having to fly through a tight canyon in complete darkness. Where the visuals visibly falter are in dense urban areas. You likely won't notice buildings when you're zooming past them at 200km/h, but any slower and you can't help but notice how plain they are, especially in broad daylight with clear skies. Character models, on the other hand, always look incredibly basic, no matter the situation.  The game's RPG-style vehicle upgrade system returns from the original game, though it still doesn't feel particularly meaningful. You'll receive loot after every race in various stages of rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic), and each corresponds to a particular vehicle part and has its own power number, which contributes to your vehicle's overall power number. There is some small benefit to this system--all vehicles of a particular class, despite having different power levels in their stock configuration, will max out at the same number, meaning you can stick with your favorite car all the way up to and through the endgame.  I'm annoyed by the game's lack of public interaction and meaningless gear system, but I'll fondly recall both the tension of flinging sprint boats back and forth through the narrow, artificial canals of The Venetian in Las Vegas, and the easygoing satisfaction of an hour-long hypercar race from New York to San Francisco, where I listened to a podcast and enjoyed the rolling scenery. Despite its shortcomings, The Crew 2 still displays admirable strengths, which lie in its player-friendly features, freedom of movement, and its willingness to bend the rules in order to make things exciting and varied for an accessible, American-themed thrillride."
43896580,english,1,646910,"✓ 150 Hours ✓ Completed 100% of the game content ✓ Completed 100% of the achievements  Here is a rundown of Pros and Cons, with explanations, along with a score breakdown and final conclusion.  Pros:      • Captivating           -With each race comes different tracks, different skips, and different means of completing. With a percentage displaying the completion of a discipline (style of race) and an online competitive track time it’s very easy to get stuck into this game. Though a track can be completed it can always be done better, this factor is what drives the racers to become faster and better.      • Updated Often      • Good portrayal           -The game does an accurate portrayal of each discipline. Whether one loves Street Racing, Off-Roading, Free-Styling, or Pro-Racing, The Crew 2 provides just what one’d believe this discipline would be like.      • Tuning           -With tuning, and even pro-tuning, each vehicle may be adjusted to preferred likings. Tuning can make or break, quite literally, a vehicle. These tuning options can add Top Speed, Power, 0-60, Quarter Mile, and more.       • Great for a completionist           -The Crew 2 is not easy to complete, but it is easy to manage and observe the progress. Each discipline comes with a percentage of completion. In game, there is also an option to pin desired missions to track progress real time.   Cons:      • Poor story           -There is little to no story on this game. Your objective is to simply “become the champion”, which is done by just racing. The story focuses on being “follower famous” which is well, I guess a good portrayal of 2018.      • Awful commentary           -The commentary is quite laughable. Some lines do not make sense to even be mentioned, while others are just repeated.      • Inconsistency           -It’s somewhat of a hit or miss, funny pun, on which items are moveable. Some large trees are destructible while other small tables are not.      • Iffy graphics           -At times the graphics are phenomenal, at other times it’s feels like I’m back in 2007. The photo editor is very solid, but the in-game scenery is lacking.      • Poor reward           -Even when completing disciplines, there is hardly any reward. The only rewarding system is given after playing many hours and becoming the status of “Icon”.  -Scoring- Content 7/10 Graphics 5/10 Story Line 3/10 Score, 15/30, 5/10, 50%  -Conclusion- I purchased a racing game and I believe that’s what I got. Though the game is lacking in commentary and story, that’s not what I personally purchased it for. I purchased it to race, which is what this game excels at. The Crew 2 is a very entertaining racing game that will certainly give hours of enjoyment (as long as you don’t care about story line and such)."
91366795,english,1,646910,"Well well well!  It's 6 months now since i bought this one and i decided after 111 hours of gameplay to review it.  [h1]First the alternative titles i would give this game.[/h1]  Ford Focus hating simulator  Epic Car Wallpaper maker  Bugatti porn  The faster hatchbacks  The Crew 2 sponsored by Ford, Bugatti, Dodge and Chevrolet.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  The gameplay itself is really good, the tutorial (well it's a Ubisoft game there isn't much to expect) isn't well thought of in my opinion.  You start of with a vehicle the game gives you to finish your first mission.  After that you've been given a (rather small) selections of vehicles/cars for free.  The further you progress into the game the more options and challenges as well as vehicles get unlocked.  For the cars for example Ubisoft decided to help you progress by giving you a free Aston Martin Vanquish (which honestly helps a lot).  The game itself offers you various types of challenges and gamemodes so you never get bored.  When it comes to missions, i sadly have to mention that the npcs even on the higher difficulty seem to struggle sometimes. Weather conditions while in a mission are nice but could cost you your lead since it looks like the npcs don't struggle with it as you do.  More to that later on.  [h1] Design [/h1]  Even on a lower setting the design and graffics are good enough for amazing screenshots.  The cars are well detailed like the real life ones, you have a very simplified map and speedometer and the menus aren't in any way confusing.  The settings are nicely ordered which is consumer friendly.  [h1] The good things [/h1]  Amazing graphics with great detailing.  Good and constructive gameplay.  A good variety of vehicles to choose from.  A photo mode with a great variety of settings to make your perfect screenshots.  A huge and well detailed map of the US  A lot of missions and challenges to choose from.  [h1] The bad/salty things [/h1]  As stated earlier, weather conditions with bad traffic could easily ruin your race.  The Navigation responds very slow and bugged since the last update  The developers seem to gotten sponsored by the car manufactorers mentioned earlier because of the sheer amount of cars of each brand that are in the game.  Some car manufactorers that have produced amazing cars e.g. Toyota, Lancia, Skoda are completely left out which is sad to be honest.  The tutorial isn't really helpful when you haven't played the game before.  [h1] The confusing things [/h1]  For example, the aero of all the cars (even those with a huge rear spoiler) isn't considered even though the game tries to be really realistic  AWD(All-wheel-drive)-Cars like the BMW M8 behave like RWD(Rear-wheel-drive)-Cars, but FWD(Front-wheel-drive)-Cars behave like RWD-Cars with more traction  Some stats of the cars are confusing: VW Golf GTI 0 - 100 km/h   2.4 seconds HP: 550                                                               Bugatti Veyron 0 - 100km/h 2.6 seconds HP: about 1670  The weight of the cars aren't mentioned and most likely not even considered in the game.  So how could your regular Golf GTI with FWD be faster from 0 - 100km/h than a hypercar that costs irl like 3.5 million Euros?  [h1] My verdict [/h1]  It is a great game with a few twists but you can enjoy it in any way you like since it's an open-world game with many options and way to play it.  Do you like to just casually drive around?  You can just do it.  Or crash into the statue of liberty with a plane for fun?  Yeah go on.  The game won't force you to play it in a specific way.  So in short i recommend it if you like cars like i do.  Short notice: Please do not take this review all so seriously since it's my honest opinion on it."
43355631,english,0,646910,"UPDATE 7/13/2018: Just wanna' add in here that you will win most races, which I have been, you just have to grind parts for a couple of hours and keep your vehicle up to date or you will get smoked by the AI. Of course it's considered common sense I suppose, but it's also a bit repetitive as well. Nevertheless, I still think the mechanics of this game are ""Ridge Racer Type R4 bump the wall lose race"" type of sh*t. But it's not too, too bad. ____________________________________________________________  So far, after spending about 26 hours on the game, it seems like all you do is mindlessly race for better car parts against AI Jesus, and while that is of course the point of the game, in The Crew 1 it felt like there was more to it as you could venture off and visit landmarks all around the USA instead of racing, learning about known areas of the country while getting paid 2,000 bucks for each landmark you visit.... which seemed (imo) to cator to people who just like to drive around, and it also had PvP at the start. There seemed to be an actual story in The Crew 1 from what I recall also. Story in this game (TC2) feels like they went a TDU2 (Test Drive Unlimited 2) direction, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'll tell you what IS bad, mindlessly grinding against the ""holier than thou, on rails"" AI for car parts, requiring you to race damn near perfect. But I'll get to that here in a second don't you worry....  Also, what's the point of having a house or garage in this game if you can't even do sh*t with it yet? Can't customize it, can't have people over, can't do jack squatty. Seems like some azz backwards logic by the devs if you ask me.  I was also doing a Hypercar race heading towards Miami, paused the game, unpaused and suddenly there's snow everywhere down south and in Miami. Needs fixed asap. Funny thing is, I mentioned this when I sent a bug report during closed beta, guess they didn't get around to it yet? Idk.  In this game it's just the same sh*t over and over again, race after race against the computer with no variation in gameplay other than the fact you have planes and boats now. One big long azz grind to get better parts for your vehicles.... which don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with it, I quite enjoy it actually... or at least I WOULD F*CKING ENJOY IT BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE THE AI IN THIS GAME DRIVES LIKE IT'S ON RAILS!!!! YOU'RE A BEAST AND IN THE LEAD YOU SAY?? DOESN'T MATTER....IF YOU EVEN BRAKE A GODD*MN MILLISECOND FROM THE OPTIMAL SPOT ON A TURN, ALL 7 DRIVERS PASS YOUR AZZ UP!!!!! LIKE WHAT KIND OF BULLSH*T IS THAT??? COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE F*CKIN PURPOSE OF UPGRADING YOUR VEHICLES IF THE COMPUTER DRIVES AS IF JESUS CHRIST IS BEHIND THE WHEEL.......  *Sigh* Okay I feel better now. And with that being said, I love the game, but I think Ubisoft/ Ivory Tower can do a little better, c'mon now. Especially since these same devs are apparently responsible for TDU, which imo blows this out of the water minus the graphics. That's sad. I mean graphically, sound-wise, and car handling.... this game is a big improvement over TC1, with the nice addition of planes, boats, and whatever else bullsh*t they may have thrown in there.... it's all fine and dandy, but the game feels empty... I'm not sure why they released a half azz game. But I don't give a f*ck, fix the AI - The End"

[/td] [/tr] [/table]  [i] My impression of the game kept on changing at each progressing 5 hours interval. This review was framed after investing 30+ hours into the game and concluding the final rivalry races. The initial hours were so repulsive and full of meh impressions. But once you get a hold of a particular vehicle type and its handling, it’s all fun and excitement.[/i]  [h1][b] 📝Story/Plot:[/b][/h1] Just a generic plot setup to give your grind some motive and goal. A rookie entering the world of racing and guess what, some organizers see his potential and gave him a chance without even seeing him race beforehand. Just be #1 all around the events and conclude your journey after beating the top dogs who were the organizers too.  [h1][b]🎮Gameplay:[/b][/h1] [b]Initial impression-[/b] Imagine a hot girl with no personality. That’s the first 5-minute impression of The Crew 2. Starting off with high budget cinematics and performing short lap segment races while shifting to a new vehicle again and again. Sounds cool right? Wait until you see the whole f*cking world curve like in the movie Inception and Doctor Strange. At this point, my jaw was indisputably touching the ground. But just after completing a normal event race, it hit me with gloom and awkwardness. All that cinematic brag of “Speed is Life” and bla bla comes down to a slow race with the road looking like a low texture road. Like WTF?  [b]Mechanics/Controllability-[/b] I know it’s not a real sim racing game, nor advertised as a pure arcade. It’s unique on its own. But I feel like not giving it a category works as a bypass for some faulty mechanics. Cars feel slightly slow and weigh a ton on the controller. The purpose of a racing game is to acknowledge the speed atmosphere, which was only endured with top cars. Cars are not at all hard to control, rather easy and amusing. It’s the damn AI that makes all the races so tryhard. You are in lead for 97% of the race and suddenly an AI got a God’s hand and achieved supersonic speed. If you are thinking of bumping into them and play dirty, well have fun bumping a rubber band. All these aspects are blades of the same sword. AI feels difficult- what a tryhard game/Thank God it’s not cheap easy. Perspective matters here. I am not against it. Surely it’s sometimes annoying, but it iz what it iz.   It’s easy to understand how ground vehicles operate, steer, brake, drift, boost. But you are not familiar with aeroplane controls. Despite that, the first intro race makes you race an aeroplane. Instead of crossing checkpoints with my plane, I was crashing into enormous buildings and respawning. A terrible scenario that gets fixed in later event races where they teach you all aeroplane controls bit by bit.  [b]Open World-[/b] Take on the American motorsports scene as you explore across the entire USA. Being able to drive different vehicles like cars, bikes, boats and planes in the same open-world means not only you are free to drift your car on street roads, tread speedboat through the waterways but fly high across the sky too. Befitting pillars for the open-world statement. Now we know there are no restrictions, but what about interactables? Unfortunately, that’s a guessing game. Oh, I have a sharp turn incoming and I have to drift? Let’s do this then. You are halfway in your drift airmailing all those bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts in space, but suddenly you see a bench in between. That’s your stoppage. These randomly placed objects like benches or parked cars don’t follow Newton’s Law. They just wanna remain stationary no matter how hard you hit them. Trust me, these little objects ruined a lot of my lap times.  [b]Variety-[/b] You can use the astonishing top-notch live map, which single-handedly increases the game score by 2. Like how they even made it render the entire game in a 3D model just by a single click. Moving forward, the complete map contains various types of events/races you can take part in. Just for clarification, there are not AI vs races only. You can take part in a race against time, drifting, freestyling and a lot of car chases too. As I said, you are buying a complete package of the racing genre with multiple vehicle types. But there seems to be a hollow part of the story. During cinematics, you can easily see the top-quality work put together and the exciting race descriptions they narrate. But in reality, you won’t find those races in action. One cinematic had an image of a monster truck jumping out of a plane with a parachute, but there’s nothing present like that. They escalated the expectations through cinematic dialogues but disappointed us in the end. It’s not completely devastating as the default variety is already more than enough.  [b]PvP/Grinding-[/b] Sadly, you can’t run away from the “Look, there’s a level 1 guy with lvl99 car” scenario. It’s Ubisoft, which means expect a lot of transactions. Buy bundles, buy a season pass (Motorpass), or add in-game currency and get any high-speed car you want, but if you don’t wanna spend a penny, good luck grinding your a*s out. Be a part of a crew and evade the boredom of grinding alone.  [h1][b]📷Graphics:[/b][/h1] Enjoy a pizza full of delicious and uplifting toppings added on a half-cooked bread base. Now all your bites will have a random taste. Some will please your tastebuds, and some will taste like cardboard. The object detailing in the open world is great, but their textures, Oh Lord. Never expected to witness those low texture brick buildings from a 2018 game. Like, come on; all the vehicles, roadside objects, even dirt tracks look so good. Then why the buildings and gravel roads look like a dusty mirror. To avoid these bad graphic races, I played air and water races the most.  [h1][b]📝Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]  [b]Pros-[/b] [list]     [*]Big Open-world.     [*]Character and vehicle customization.     [*]Good chunk of playable time.      [*]Multiple vehicle types.     [*]Varied races and challenges.     [*]Offline or Online races. [/list]  [b]Cons-[/b] [list]     [*]Grind vs PayToWin is real.     [*]Semi cooked graphics.     [*]Annoying indestructible objects.     [*]No dynamic weather in the open world. [/list]  [h1][b]🏷️Tips to new players:[/b][/h1] Keep in mind, you can drift your plane. Without this, you are going to kiss the land whenever you take a flight. Don’t start PvP races until you reach at least the Famous rank. There are no restrictions on which racetrack to follow. So cut the track however you want. The first one to cross the checkpoint is the winner. Change resolution to borderless. Otherwise, whenever you will Alt+Tab, the game will start re-syncing, which wastes 4-10 seconds of your life every time.  [h1][b]😇Honest Rating:[/b][/h1] If you are looking for that NFS arcade or real sim racing like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, then just buy them instead. It’s nowhere perfect or overly marvellous. But I can assure you, if you invest enough hours into the game, you will adore it even as toxic relation. Only buy on big sale!  Rating: 8/10 Best world bending I ever saw."
88527600,english,1,646910,I played Forza Horizon (3 and 4) before playing The Crew 2 and it (the crew) disappointed me. Is more like an arcade game and for me is boring. I prefer Forza. I am not saying that is not a good game but I had higher expectations.
88608887,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is one of my all-time favorite racing games, mostly because of all the freedom the player has. I'm not like the average car fan, in racing games I usually like to see how crazy I can make a car look instead of customizing it as if it was a real world vehicle, and the crew 2 is the perfect game for players like me. The customization is amazing, there are dozens and dozens of different parts for each of the nearing 400 vehicles, including a livery creating system to make and share skins with the community. The Crew 2 also has a big variety of vehicles, including my favorite, the DMC DeLorean (though I hope sometime soon they'll add tesla vehicles to the game!). The map is also extremely large, with amazing graphics, especially lighting. The tracks/courses are fun and creative, although some can be annoying at times. Overall, I give The Crew 2 5 stars, and I would recommend the game to any racing fan."
164128496,english,0,646910,"Doesn't matter how good this game is if it just gets taken away from you whenever they decide they've taken enough money off of you. As a longtime player of The Crew games and a lover of The Crew 2, do not buy this game. Pirate this $hit instead. Ubisoft CEO said players should be ""comfortable with not owning"" their games. Start by not owning this one."
43749472,english,0,646910,"WARNING, DO NOT BUY DELUXE EDITION!!! I bought this game either launch day or the day after (Deluxe Edition) and here we are nearly a month later an I have not recieved either of the 2 vehicles in the Legendary Vehicles Pack, they were locked under ""Early Access"" and can now be purchased by everyone, problem is I have already paid an extra $20 dollars for them. Support is un-responsive and my issue has been ignored totally in the forums, so what did I end up with? I ended up with an $80 dollar base game. so BUYER BEWARE, get the regular version or the gold, deluxe is complete rip off."
81510860,english,0,646910,"In short, Great concept, ((STUPID)) expensive on top of also Micro-transactions GALORE!!!    In detail: The concept of this game is great! The map size (Friggin huge), multiple motorsports, and the amount of multiplayer potential is amazing! There is however a pretty BIG issue with the current way the game is going. Its following the same downward spiral a lot of other games are doing. ""premium currency"" and the so-called ""battlepass"" (Litterally worded as ""motorpass"" in this game.)   Now im not bashing on the battlepass idea entirely. if this game was free-to-play with DLC's i could understand...however this game costs a gross amount of money and it still feels like a ""free-to-play"" game. they have these ""Crew Credits"" (CC) that USED to be obtained via contracts. however now they are only obtained through this ""battlepass"" in order to be able to get EVERYTHING from the motorpass, it will cost ya 80k CC. You get 20k for free from the pass and an additional 20k if ya bought the premium motorpass. Furthermore most of the content of the game is locked behind this paywall. I'm sorry but if i pay $90 for a game, i wanna be able to play ALL of it. (Forza Horizon series did it right in my opinion.) Lots of cars to drive? yup but if ya want them all...gotta get through the paywall. Hey want a cool police lightbar? We got ya covered! Just spend 80k CC and grind your hind end off every day and maybe get almost to the END of the ""motorpass"" and you can have it right before ya get burnt out on the game!   Players are leaving the game because of this stuff and i feel like the devs are thinking ""Game is dying? welp time to milk every last dime out of the remaining players till it dies! Then we will work on ANOTHER game and when it dies, we will do it AGAIN!"" This isn't a game made truely for players, it a game made just for profit.  PS. Just bought some crew credits for my sis on her account with my card, Money is gone, Crew Credits not there. They are more than money monsters, they are scammers! Also, funny how i cant find a phone number for the ubisoft support. Guess ill have to have a conversation with a robot"
60802811,english,1,646910,"Let me get right to the point. I would not recommend this game if you're looking for a good racing game. I would not recommend this game if you are all about graphics. I would not recommend this game if you like any sort of story line.           I would recommend this game highly, higher than any other game if you're looking for something you can just listen to your chill playlist, cruise, and maybe even get boofed ;). I purchased this game last year (base game) for full price, I think I put maybe $10 into it after that to get a nice drift car, then I realized the games racing is shit.           So now I only play the game to go cruise the US and just relax and waste time. Nothing like coming home from work, heating up the rig and downing a glob, then just chilling driving around."
70528009,english,0,646910,"5/10 - Lots to like, but lots to hate. Could have been so much more. Full review below:  = Intro =  Sometimes, I'm in the mood for a racer. I fondly remember the days of NFSU 2, Gran Turismo on the PS and Most Wanted, games that not only lasted me weeks, but gave me new bands to listen to and endless replay value. Had this on my 'to play' list so got around to it. Enjoyed Forza, but it felt a bit flat and I wanted something with a bit more progression.  = Gameplay =  This is a racing game. Vrooom, cars go fast. But it's also a watersports game. And an offroad game. And a rally game. And a flying stunts game. And a flying racer game. And another dozen types of racing/stunt game rolled into one. Oh and also a loot game. You can see the problem immediately.  That said, man - this game does try. And sometimes gets it right. The water racing is immensely fun. Rally racing is great. Motorcross is mostly a blast. The absolute apex of the game for me are the lengthy 'runs' - massive races between cities, that lead you through towns, cities, mountains, forests etc. Glorious.  The weakest part of the game for me has to be the street racing, which isn't the nice, varied, speedy tracks you are likely expecting, but rather boxy, twisty monstrosities filled with right-angle turns. Right off the bat, these were frustrating as heck and some of the later ones will make you want to eat a kitten.  This has to do with the fact that a lot of cars handle like shopping carts and the more expensive ones handle like shopping carts with a jet booster. This game works best with long, open tracks, which sadly are lacking in a lot of styles.  Beyond this, every 'discipline' has it's own set of vehicles and loot. Welcome to the grind overdrive. And this is made worse by the fact that the sheer number of event types means that many only get a handful of races, total.  However the kicker is the AI. It...cheats. Rubberbanding is utterly crazy, especially when you start doing higher difficulty races - but unlike other games, it's only applied to give the AI an advantage. If you fail to drive perfectly on some tracks, the AI will soar past you instantly. Or it may just randomly do that anyway.  However once the AI is ahead, it just keeps on going. This is especially evident in the set-vehicle races where you and the AI have (allegedly) the same vehicles and specs. However, on Ace, you can enjoy the sight of the AI flying into the distance right from the get go, waving and flipping the bird.  This leads to a lot of styles being not only about driving prowess but luck, and finding ways to break the game. Weird, unmarked shortcuts, odd physics and the like. Sigh.  All of that said though, I don't hate this game. When it works, it works like gangbusters. Maybe if they had removed the boring flying stuff and produced double the races for existing styles, this could have been a winner.  = Graphics and Audio =  Visually, this game is a mixed bag. Water is lovely. Weather is beautiful. Lighting can be stunning. But textures are meh and ...wow, do cities look awful. Especially at daytime. Framerates are perfect.  Audio, rather than the mix of metal, rock, punk, rap and EDM you may be expecting is instead a small collection of the blandest EDM known to man.   = Style =  As I've said - too cluttered, too thinly spread.  And the interface/design is a nightmare. Let's say you do a race a few times, restarting immediately after you finish. Your loot goes to the mailbox. You then need to leave the race (loading time), go to a racing base (loading time), walk around, get the mail, exit the base (loading time), go to your home (loading time), walk up to your vehicle stand, change your vehicle (loading time) and then upgrade it.  Welcome to busywork.  But the absolute worst thing for me was discovering, after returning to the game after a long period, that there was no way to reset progress, whatsoever. Meaning if you experiment early and foul things up, there is no way to ever remedy it.  = Value =  To be fair, there is a lot here for the price, especially if you get this game on it's frequent, really good specials.  There are microtransactions, but most of the stuff can be earned in-game. However there is also stuff that can't. And I'm sick of microtransactions in AAA priced games.  = Overall =  + Many events are insanely fun + Original and well implemented loot system + 'Run' races are just awesome  - Impossible to ever reset progress/start a new game - Insanely cheaty AI - Frustrating street racing - Awful interface - Open world feels meaningless - Spread way too thin - Ubisoft style microtransactions  At the end of the day, this is a game I really want to like. With a bit more focus, less insane design decisions and some better/more interesting tracks, this could have been amazing. As it is...it's both enjoyable enough to keep me playing and flawed enough to make this hard to recommend."

135628343,english,1,646910,"[h1] This game is simply amazing! [/h1] The graphics are great. There is a [b] ton [/b] of content. Great progression too, you are always advancing, but little by little, making for interesting game play over time. It is definitely worth its standard 50$ price tag but I bought it when it was on sale for 10$.  Thank you for reading my review!"
180604033,english,1,646910,"Many people say that this game is bad, assuming that it is because of the horrible graphics you will always notice. Personally, this is one of the games that I would recommend to give some time to spend on because it is fun and the player has freedom to cruise around and do numerous activities whether you play by yourself or with a built crew.  With the ability to switch to another vehicle whether air or water while driving, you get to realize that there are so many things that this game offers. For me, this is an awesome game, though the sole issue I have with this game is that it is only playable ONLINE. I wish there is a feature where in you can drive around and participate in races even without the online feature or just disabled online mode. In addition to the free-roaming, there are races that provide the player a huge drop of cash and with the ability to increase the number of drop of car parts and money by progressing your ICON stats, you are guaranteed wealthy enough to purchase numerous vehicles of different disciplines that are so many that I am speechless of this game and how amazing it is.  To conclude. The Crew 2 is fun. Surely some will say the graphic renditions, especially buildings and environments have awful sight to it, but still, with all honesty, this is a fun game to play. If you purchased the Gold Edition, you will receive free, if I am not mistaken, 22 vehicles for free and few exclusive vehicles that you can get for free."
62437027,english,1,646910,"This game has received a lot of hate. Personally, I believe a lot of the hate it undeserved, but they can make some good points.  Starting with the pros: - Vehicle variety and detail. This game has over 300 different vehicles, and personally I believe the detail on the vehicles is out standing, even things as small as bolts for some extended fenders:   10/10  - Vehicle Customisation. Almost all of the vehicles have a wide range of changeable parts. There are many options to choose from in an easy to navigate menu, as well as bonus items that can be rewarded from playing the game by doing daily missions giving you a currency to buy special items such as under glow, custom wheels, tire smoke and more.         9/10  - The Map Size. The map size is where this game stands out above all. In a fast car (280Mph top speed+) with good driving it took me over an hour to travel from the southeast tip to the north west tip. In this map you will find several cities and other land marks along the way, also encountering the occasional player along your journey. The details in the cities are spectacular and the amount of places to go are countless.     10/10  - Multiplayer. The game puts you into a public lobby filled with usually around 3 to 8 other players, communicating with a custom chat menu which prevents and toxicity or bullying. When you want to play alone you can but on the other hand if you are looking to go on a road trip with a friend or do some races with a pal this game has made an easy system for you to do so.       8/10  - Race Variety. Currently in the game there and 16 different Motorsports events to choose from:       -Street Race, Drift, Drag race, Hyper car       -Motor cross, Hovercraft, Rally cross ( off-road ), Rally raid       -Freestyle ( Stunt planes), jet sprint ( Small boat racing ), demo derby, Monster truck       -Touring car, F1, Boat racing, Air race Along with these you get different skill based activities like Speed-traps and escapes ( furthest distance in a period of time ) as well as Photo ops of landmarks or player scenarios.          10/10  - The Summit. Every week, there is a series of events that you can do competing against other players in order to win prices such as followers, parts or occasionally, cars. This feature gives a deep purpose to this game, and for me a feeling like i need and want to come back to do those races and get those prizes. 10/10  Smaller mentions: -Unlimited garage space -Customisable car settings and parts -As you level up, you will receive rewards at certain milestones ( Cars planes boats etc )   And now the Cons:  -Graphics. This game can look beautiful, however a lot of the places feel empty or dull, like they need something extra. Also, the shading was poorly made, with a lot of colours looking flat. Like I said, certain places look fantastic and are very photogenic, however the textures aren't HD and could have more colour. With a simple graphics remake this game could easily be level with GTA V or FH4.     3.5/10  -Sound. Some of the car sounds are well executed, but for the most part they seem dull and like they could be more intense. The vehicles that do sound good are incredible, however a lot of cars that seem powerful get underwhelmed by the sounds coming from the engine.  4/10  -Weather. Now when i say weather I need to make it VERY clear i mean the weather changing, not the visuals. In my opinion, the rain in this game falls just short of GTA V rain puddles in the city at night, but with this game you can be in sunny weather, you go into settings to maybe turn your sound down a little and when you are out of the menu, boom: Thick snow. Even when it changes visibly to the player, it is too fast and too frequent. 5/10  -The Voices. Oh my lord turn off voices and turn on subtitles because the majority of the voices in this game are infuriating and get super annoying super quick.     1.5/10  -The prices. The vehicle prices can be realistic and occasionally generous, with a Buggati Chiron costing 2.4 million, but then when you venture over to the low end of the spectrum like bikes, you start to see prices like 500 grand for a sports bike. It isn't accurate. Another thing to mention is the grind for money. The money received after a race needs to increase, as grinding mindlessly for 3 hours in order to save up 2.4 million like I have done gets quite frustrating, and whilst it normally pays off, the pain you feel inside when you know the only way to get yourself that money you need for your next car is going to take 100 races of the same race is discomforting and off-putting.  Important note: i see a lot of people talking about rubber banding and i need to say i have never experienced this. I often finish races 10-30 seconds ahead when i use my super fast vehicles, and on other races like the 40 minute race it is often minutes ahead. If there was rubber banding, how could the times they are behind me be so large?  To summarise, I am saying this game is worth it, but keep it in your wishlist until it is on a sale to make up for the cons you may experience in this game.  Peace.    Side note to any active players: Anyone down to do some races together? DM me."
171979040,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2, a game where you can switch from driving a hypercar to piloting a plane faster than you can say ""Did I just clip that skyscraper?""  The game’s map is a condensed version of the USA, which means you can drive from New York to Los Angeles in about 30 minutes. Take that, real-world traffic!  Switching between vehicles is as simple as pressing a button. One moment you're cruising down the streets of Miami, and the next, you're free-falling from the sky because you accidentally transformed into a boat mid-air. Pro tip: boats don't fly.  The variety of races is vast, and so are the number of trees I've crashed into while attempting to pull off that ""totally planned"" drift. And let's not forget the photo mode challenges. Nothing says ""professional photographer"" like trying to snap a pic of a flamingo while barrel-rolling in a jet.  In conclusion, the game is pretty fun, sure the handling physics aren't anything like NFS of Forza, but the game has its charms."
174694396,english,0,646910,"[h1] Stop Destroying Videogames [/h1]  [b]  European Citizens' Initiative :  Video games have grown into an industry with billions of customers worth hundreds of billions of euros. During this time, a specific business practice in the industry has been slowly emerging that is not only an assault on basic consumer rights but is destroying the medium itself.  An increasing number of publishers are selling video games that are required to connect through the internet to the game publisher, or ""phone home"" to function. While this is not a problem in itself, when support ends for these types of games, very often publishers simply sever the connection necessary for the game to function, proceed to destroy all working copies of the game, and implement extensive measures to prevent the customer from repairing the game in any way.  This practice is effectively robbing customers of their purchases and makes restoration impossible. Besides being an affront on consumer rights, video games themselves are unique creative works. Like film, or music, one cannot be simply substituted with another. By destroying them, it represents a creative loss for everyone involved and erases history in ways not possible in other mediums.  Existing laws and consumer agencies are ill-prepared to protect customers against this practice. The ability for a company to destroy an item it has already sold to the customer long after the fact is not something that normally occurs in other industries. With license agreements required to simply run the game, many existing consumer protections are circumvented. This practice challenges the concept of ownership itself, where the customer is left with nothing after ""buying"" a game.     We wish to invoke Article 17 §1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [EUR-Lex - 12012P/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] – “No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss.” – This practice deprives European citizens of their property by making it so that they lose access to their product an indeterminate/arbitrary amount of time after the point of sale. We wish to see this remedied, at the core of this Initiative.   We also invoke Title XV of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)[EUR-Lex - 12012E/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] and the following TFEU Articles as our justification for and the Union’s imperative to respond to this initiative:  Article 169 – Per §1, the EU has an obligation “to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection…to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers”. We believe this practice infringes upon or requires correction to be commensurate with the EU’s obligation. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with videogames.    Article 12 – “Consumer protection requirements shall be taken into account in defining and implementing other Union policies and activities.” Given that this practice extends across Member States and beyond the EU, the Union’s actions regarding this practice ought to keep consumer protection in mind. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with video games.  Article 114, §3 – “The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection… Within their respective powers, the European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective” This practice undermines the high level of consumer protection that the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council takes as the basis of law in the Union, and their objectives of establishing and maintaining the functioning of an internal market as described in §1 of this Article, and Article 26 TFEU.[/b]  [h1] THE CREW 2 IS NEXT!

94458352,english,1,646910,"Easily one of the best arcade racing games out there. Most of the critics are by the people who either judged the game by playing just a couple of hours or those comparing it with other racing/driving games. Here's my take on its pros and cons:  PROS:  1. Map: Insanely huge map of the USA. Has almost all the visiting sites you can think of. It'd take you half an hour to drive from NY to San Francisco. You can never get bored of the map, period.  2. Car collection: Huge car collection from all the popular makes. They keep adding more every week and with every new update. Same with boats, planes, etc. You can actually buy like 98% of the cars without paying actual money. You might need some grinding though. 'New York' or the 'Uber dam' are good events to grind.  3. Car customization: You can customize almost everything from car color to tires, rims, wings, body kits, smokes, nitros, windows, even the underglows. There's also a good, active community that keeps adding custom liveries (skins/vinyls) which you can apply to your cars directly. And of course, there's a decent liverly editor too.  4. Race tracks: Challenging and fun race tracks. Some even have good shortcuts which you can master by driving repeatedly. You may try to break some of the world records.  5. Diversity: Various disciplines to choose from. You ever get bored from the street races, you can do boat race, jet race, air race, motorbike race, monster trucks, you name it. Although the game has good diversity, it's biased towards street races due to the number of events available in it compared to other disciplines. But then, if you're a street racing fan, that's what you want.  6. Regular content update: Really impressed with the 'Live Summit' weekly events with unique themes. You compete with other players to get the prizes. Prizes being special edition cars, tires, car parts, nitros, followers, etc.  CONS:  1. Graphics: Being a 2018 game, the graphics could've been better. You can't expect amazing graphics for such a giant map but the textures and reflections could still be better (as they're reused a lot). The lightings/weather system is good during the day with bright sunlight but it looks like a water painting when cloudy or rainy. The nights are okay at best.  2. Unbalanced AI: The AI in the game is somewhat unbalanced. I mean you can easily win street races or hypercars in Ace (highest difficulty) with a decent, well-upgraded car. Like a Buggati Divo or La Voiture Noire. But then you'll sweat to finish even the 'Easy' drag races without grinding.  3. Physics: Funny. If you're looking for a racing game with realistic or good physics, this isn't the one. They've surely made the car handling better with each update, but it still hurts to see a hypercar wobble at 400+ kmph with slight curves.  4. Optimization: I'm not sure how it scored 7/10 on GameDebate for optimization. I have a good GPU. Though it runs smooth most of the time, a crowded street race or a multiplayer with varied ping rates would cause immediate lags. Sometimes even kick players out. Even the processor and the GPU runs hotter during the gameplay as compared to other games of the same scale.  5. PvP: There's no customizability for PvP races. Also, the PvP player base is low and often results in a long waiting time.  If you're a racing freak who loves arcade and don't mind a bit of a funny physics, go get it. You won't regret. If you're into simulators and graphics, stay away. I've been a Forza fan myself (have a good amount of hours spent on the windows store version), but this game is still very fun in what it offers."

119911539,english,1,646910,"I ignored this game for many years because I thought every single event involved a mix of cars, boats, and flying. Oh no, I was very wrong.  Had a lot of fun with this one. I bought the base game on sale for 10 bucks. The season pass isn't necessary as it just adds more cars and a slight discount in the game store, but you don't need it, you just gotta play and earn stuff that way which to me is more fun.   I'm really glad there's actually characters and narratives that kept me interested. A lot of racing games are just go here, do the race, go to the next one, etc etc. But here the story, leveling up, loot and characters made it feel like I was aiming for a goal.   There's a TON of stuff to do. Street racing, hyper car racing, drag, drift, power boats, air races,  rallycross, hovercraft, motocross, touring, demolition derby, and MONSTER TRUCKS!!!! Those were my favorite. It's all arcadey feeling, so you can turn your car in mid air and stuff like that. There's also HUGE JUMPS which are so much fun. Plus there's loads of side activities like taking photos of landmarks, animals, stunts, etc, and escape missions, speed traps to name a few. Not to mention weekly events (called Live Summit) that have leaderboards and rewards are based on how many points you rack up against other players.   On top of all that there's these really cool movie like scenarios called Motorflix where you have to either do events for movies, or smash vehicles like youre in Burnout 3. AND there's treasure map type missions where you get clues and have to find the specific area and take a picture, which when all are completed you'll get a nice reward. All of it is completely optional. You don't have to do every single event in any section to progress. I jumped around a lot. When I got tired of races, I'd jump into some drag races, monster trucks, photo ops, live summit or the motorflix. Just whatever you wanna do.  Speaking of rewards, this game gives them out nicely. Not just cars either. You can get parts, cool visual stuff like neon underglows or colored tire smoke or nitro colors. It's basically a dopamine simulator.   Got all the achievements, completed the live extreme series and did over 70% of street racing, offroad, freestyle, and pro racing events. I also did all three seasons of motorflix and part of season six. There's still a ton of stuff left to do if I wanted as well.  The only stuff I didn't like was that since you can fast travel to any event, there isn't much reason to drive around the world. Kinda wish they would take a Forza Horizon approach and have billboards and fast travel boards scattered around to encourage this, but the way the whole game is set up is still really fun. I wish the game had more steam achievements too since there's so many things to do and unlock in game. Kinda surprised they had em in the first place considering it's a Ubisoft game. But the worst part is it's online all the time, which means when Ubi shuts down the servers the game will be dead, probably. So it's possible the game has an expiration date, unless they let people play it single player.   And let me point out that while the game is called The Crew 2, I basically played almost the entire game by myself. I joined a crew for a little bit and did some stuff, but then I guess I got kicked out but all of my progress was still there so no big deal."
173366642,english,0,646910,"I can't express how deeply unsatisfying the non-physics-based driving feels; it's worse than a cheap arcade motorcycle game. Furthermore, online required (see what happened to The Crew 1), terrible, LONG, extremely frequent cut-scenes, very poor UI decisions (I couldn't even figure out how to exit the game!), FPS and resolution limited, a mandatory anti-cheat driver, and mediocre graphics means that there are far better games out there. The only reason I can see to purchase this game is for its boat racing, but even then, it's boring, in my opinion.  I don't really understand the positive reviews given how terrible driving feels to be honest."
169260250,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 doesn't work on the Steam Deck because Ubisoft refuses to support it. They could flip a switch and allow Linux compatibility with the anti-cheat, they just don't want to.  Plus we now know that paying for this game does not equal owning the game. Ubisoft owns the game and they will take away your access whenever they feel like it, just like they did with the original.  They don't respect Steam Deck customers but that shouldn't be a surprise because they've shown through their actions that they don't respect any of their customers."
68680690,english,1,646910,"Put some music on, grab your favorite car, and just drive.  Edit: Forza Horizon 4 is now on steam, this game is still ok but Forza is WAY better at the same concept. don't buy this, buy Forza."
48440230,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 has got the potential for a good arcade racing game. Unfortunately it's not.   While the graphics look nice and the cars offer very good feedback, the whole setting sucks. The story makes you want to turn of your PC as soon as those ai smart asses, you have to team up with, start talking. Their constant advice makes you want to throw up, run away or punch them in the face. And they keep talking all the time.  Of course you're a rookie driving your way up to stardom by collecting followers. The dream of every six year old.  And of course your path to the top is riddled with obstacles. At least that's something Ubisoft really does well. Especially when this concept forces players to pay real money to overcome the hindrances.  Your main hindrance are cars because you ain't got none. Or should I say almost none. The standard version of The Crew 2 gives you a slow street car, a slow plane and a slow boat. At least this allows you to play some races.   You need to win races to gain followers. Ending games in first, second or third position also grants you upgrades for your vehicle.  Additionally you earn in-game money. In-game money is needed to buy new cars, planes or boats. And that's exactly where Ubisofts sales department steps in. In order to shorten the tedious task of endlessly driving races to win the money necessary to buy cars for different events or higher racing classes, you can simply buy in-game money with real money.   You can also buy the season pass which grants you two new cars every month for one year and an in-game discount when buying new cars. Of course the season pass costs real money.  You also need the best cars in order to compete with other players in multi-player mode. It will take you a lot of racing time winning the necessary in-game money to buy the cars needed to beat the competition. And you also need to upgrade the cars.  No matter what type of car you buy, you always receive the standard edition. So you need to drive races with this car to add upgrades.   There's a lot of work to get the cars you need. And Ubisoft made sure that there are many different vehicles you need.  - Street Race - Drift - Drag Race - Hyper Car - Rally Raid - Moto Cross - Rally Cross - Aerobatics - Jetsprint - Monster Truck - Powerboat - Touring Car - Air Race - Alpha GP  In order to stand a chance in multi-player mode you need to learn the tracks including all shortcuts. Thankfully the multi-player tracks are the same as the single-player races. This gives you the chance to train and memorize routes.  Contrary to The Crew 1 the USA is no longer the star of the game. Although graphics have improved, villages and cities look exchangeable. The unique atmosphere of Chicago, New York, San Francisco or Miami is no longer perceptible in The Crew 2. Even the countryside sometimes looks artificial. Not everywhere, but in some places.   At some locations it seems as if the developers didn't finish designing the landscape. There are areas where bushes and trees seem to be missing and hills are bald.  Free riding is no longer fun. That's because other cars drive closer together. The Crew 1 allowed you to race top speed in the middle of the highway passing cars on both sides. Try that in The Crew 2 and you will constantly crash.  You often find places where the game tells you to take a photo. You'll get an achievement once you took 40 photos in unique places. If you tell the game to mark the spot for the photo nothing is marked. You'll start searching but don't know where to go. There's no mark at all and neither navigation not mini-map can guide you. Then you take a photo and still have 40 photos left to take.  The same applies for extra upgrades. Extra upgrades are scattered all over the US. Once you move close to an upgrade your navigation system starts blinking and pinging. But if you search for the upgrade it's nowhere to be found. At least I can't find them. In 20 hours play time I found a single upgrade. It was a huge shining blue box on a field, twice as big as my car and it could not be missed. But whenever I search for them in a city they are nowhere to be found. Not sure if it's me but it's frustrating. I think it's bugged or again unfinished development.  I could continue listing disadvantages but I guess you get the idea. Steam only allows 8000 words per review and I had to shorten this one.  The Crew 2 is a mess and the games only purpose is to pull money out of your pockets. I assume Ubisoft forced the developers to design the game this way. Market target are kids and youngsters that are likely to pay for better cars. Make it colorful, rise their self-esteem by increasing their number of followers and make them feel important.  Is there something good? Yes.  The developers managed to make drifting very enjoyable and very well controllable, given you picked the right car. I found the Ford Mustang GT Fastback to offer fantastic drift control.  All cars feel different and every car behaves very unique. That's a point the developers really did well. Feedback from cars is great and you can really feel if you're driving a limousine, a muscle car or a beach buggy.  Pros: - beautiful graphics - many races - very good feedback from cars - all cars feel unique - driving in general is fun - very good car engine sounds - you can fine tune your cars in very many ways (if you find the settings) - all cars, boats and planes can be test driven (for one or two minutes) - some upgrades offer special bonuses - photo mode, including filters  Cons: - extremely annoying story and ai team partners - ...that keep talking annoying bullshit and treat you like a child - cities feel artificial and static even if they look beautiful - only random car upgrades - very buggy - even crashes sometimes - distant traffic very often vanishes if you move closer - feels unfinished - every race has an introduction where you have to drive to the start line and some idiot gives annoying advice or talks about other very infuriating nonsense - ...and it happens every time you re-start the race - tries hard to make you pay real money - the game even sells clothes for your avatar - vehicles are very expensive making it an endless grind to buy a hyper-car - limited fun - often hard to find players in multi-player although the game is not that old - multiplayer races are far less fun than in The Crew 1 - free ride is far less fun than in The Crew 1 and often very annoying - zoomed out map of USA is simply black and white and looks far worse than in The Crew 1 - cumbersome, annoying menu navigation - not a single good song on the in-game radio stations. Seriously - not one. Not even in classic. - emphasis on single-player - long start time - no cops - cars given to season pass owners can not be purchased by none season pass owners - even some T-Shirts for your avatar can only be bought by season pass owners - boat races are difficult because you loose a lot of speed when you jump over ramps while the ai somehow doesn't - rubber-band ai - annoying photo challenges - ...and a lot of annoying other challenges - the game does not grant you upgrades or money if you win in a higher difficulty but your car does not have the necessary upgrade class. Even if you actually did win! WTF?! - all player characters are ugly and can't be changed once you picked yours - you only get loot in races if you win - no reason to explore the map independently (unlike in The Crew 1) - drag races are still extremely boring - plane acrobatics are even more boring - monster trucks and hovercrafts are totally unnecessary - I couldn't figure out how to instantly switch between cars, planes and boats - I couldn't figure out how to join a crew"

112286236,english,0,646910,"Game is great, around 400+ vehicles in it, different modes, cheesy story, but a good one nonetheless.

So despite that the game runs great and smoothly, the launcher doesn't. Making new friends is impossible and inviting old ones to play with you together is impossible, too.

68199299,english,0,646910,"If this game goes on sale for $15 and you have nothing else to play I could recommend this game. The sad part is, this is a good game. It's a lot of fun. But the reason I can't recommend it is because the PVP is completely fucked. The Live Summit is the only way to get exclusive vehicles, but good luck ranking high enough in the live summit to score one of those exclusive vehicles. If you check the leaderboards, its blatantly obvious that the top players (whom you have to compete against in order to win the exclusive rewards) are exploiting. You can literally watch their ghost use these exploits to achieve a higher score, meaning the only way for you to beat them and unlock exclusive vehicles is to take all the fun out of the game and use the exploit yourself. If you just want to play solo, or with friends, I can recommend this game because the driving is fun and the graphics are great. However as a fan of PVP and racing games, I can't recommend this game until the dev team decides to do something about all of the exploiting players that rule the leaderboards. They need to either remove the exploits and wipe the leaderboards, or make it so that you can unlock every vehicle in the game without participating in the live summits. Either fix the PVP, or give us a way to work around it and still enjoy the game."
160183351,english,1,646910,"This is better than Motofest. Screw you Ubisoft. Should've just made it as a DLC for this one instead of making it stand-alone.  The best Parts of games that play on a larger scale is that they can be expanded with time. Even with paid DLC.

154144034,english,0,646910,"Games sold as Single Player titles should have offline capabilities. They should not have Always Online features. It is appalling how disconnected the companies are from their clientele.  As long as the product is sold and non-refundable, they are good. If the patch doesn't come out for the game that is being taken down just because Online features and upkeep of the servers are not feasible things for the company, it will clearly show there the interest lies.   People get it, keeping up with server payments and infrastructure is costly and doesn't get cheaper, but if you pull a license from paying customers just like that, I really hope people will take notice and never buy anything from them going forward.   I won't, and will do my best to advise everyone I can to steer clear from companies like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.   And I really do hope companies that feel that it's an okay thing to do to their customers will implode and close up shop. It would suck for talented people who work on good games, but they are not the ones that profit from their own creations.  Edit: If anything, it would be somewhat of a fun time to pirate games of the said company to enjoy them for free. And without the constant worry that the library I've spent money on will go AWOL because some asshole in a suit made a call. I'm more than happy to pay for games I play, but the sad reality we all worried about for about a decade and a half start to creep in - If it's not Physical, don't buy it. I'm sure there will be more and more precedents like this and the big companies will hide behind ""anti-piracy drm"" argument with their Always Online bullshit as well.

172145788,english,1,646910,"I honestly kind of expected this game to be horrible. But Once I finally got it working, it was a lot more enjoyable then I planned it to be.

177818626,english,1,646910,"I'd say this game is worth a try. There’s plenty of racing, though it’s kind of like the towers in Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry—you’re constantly grinding for something.  About that grind: collecting tuning parts (to get bonuses, you need to put together a full set of the same color and type) can be a hassle. Don’t expect to complete a set easily—you’ll likely be replaying the same race multiple times. There are around 200 races in total, each with three difficulty levels. I’ve cleared 88% of the main races and about 51% of the three other categories, and I’m nowhere near completing a full set on any car. But honestly, you don't need a full set. Once you max out your car’s power, you can just blow past the AI ​​opponents and enjoy the view.  And the views here are worth it. The game is gorgeous, and the scale is impressive. You truly feel like you’re driving across an entire country. The map might even be bigger than Euro Truck Simulator's, even with all the DLC. Each state has its own distinct look and vibe, and I loved the variety.  The one downside is that the game kind of forces you to try different modes. I wasn’t really into planes or Off-Road, though the boat races were surprisingly fun. Some modes just feel pointless, like Derby. It’s just cars bouncing around with no real destruction physics. And F1 racing doesn’t really fit either—the arcade physics don’t do it justice, and when you’re driving an F1 car off-road, it’s just weird.  At first, I hated Off-Road races and was ready to skip them. I tried MX, Aerobatics, and Touring Car instead, but that sense of “incomplete” pushed me to finish those 20 Off-Road races, unlock the boss, and complete all the achievements.  Overall, the game’s pretty easy—maybe too easy. To make it more challenging, you’d have to clear everything on the easiest difficulty first, and with a game this big, that can get tiring. I put in 30 hours and only got through half the game. I really enjoyed the hypercars, though; I’d be down for even more long races that last an hour or more. There’s something special about speeding down a wide-open highway, listening to music, and soaking up the graphics.  In short, there’s something for everyone here, so I’d say it’s worth a thumbs-up."

SUPER disappointed in this game. This isn't even worth $60 it's definitely a $20 game or less. Honestly a low effort trash money grab.  Ironically there was a warning at the beggining of the open beta menu, where it said that it was a beta and that it doesn't represent the full game, NOPE, that beta literally showed everything the full game had to offer.

176423165,english,1,646910,"Ubisoft is undeniably awful and I hold no love for them, but this ended up possibly being the best dollar I ever spent. I got it originally because the discount was just too much to pass up but didn't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as I have and will continue to do. This title made me realize I love racing games.   I don't know how deep any of the activities are compared to the competition in the genre but it's pure good fun. There's lots of variety in event types and tons of vehicles with impressive customization. The drawbacks are that the characters are insufferable, just about every line of dialog is cringe inducing and the voice acting is wretchedly bad — but fortunately none of that matters in a game like this. Maybe that's a plus if you can laugh at it, but for me skipping just about all of it is mandatory.   Just turn up the music and drive! Or fly! Or sail."
174581978,english,0,646910,"I decided to play this game rather than leave it in the steam library simply because Ubisoft decided to close the server of the crew 1 rather than proving a patch of allowing players to play offline. It's shameful. Back to this, a perfect touring game, a bad game, a terrible racing game. There are too many I can criticise about this game: terrible car selection in the menu, terrible handling and driving feedback, lacking of vehicle trade or hiding, and the worst is demolition derby. However there are many good about this game as well: large map and beautiful landscape, nice weather system and the best is the diversity of vehicles. Overall this game deserves a thumb up, Ubisoft is not. Now I think it's time to bring Vivendi back and put some pressure to Ubi."
53422750,english,1,646910,"Given my opinions and thoughts on its predecessor, I never thought I would've liked The Crew 2, let alone recommend it. But here I am. It's not a 100% recommendation, the game sure does have its flaws but for the price I paid during this sale, it's well worth it and deserves praise. And considering how much this game tries to get as close as possible to its competitor Forza Horizon, a comparison between the two games is as natural as it is mandatory. Let's examine its strengths:  Map: it's HUGE. I really mean it. It's huge unlike any other map you have seen in any other racing game. Looking at Forza Horizon's maps makes them look like they're the size of an ant. And unlike in The Crew 1, I get a feeling of traveling in the middle of nowhere much less frequently. Environments are diverse and there is more attention to details. Many opportunities for offroad. It really gives you a sense of freedom when exploring. Big yes.  Loading times: ... loading times? Never heard of that. Seamlessly teleport around the map and change vehichles on the fly. No waiting.  Content: cars? Let's be honest, that's the main reason we play this game for, right? Not just street-legal cars, but also offroad trucks and buggies, rallycross cars, and hypercars. But we ain't got only that. We have boats, planes and hovercrafts at our disposal as well. Which of course are a nice addition, but we're most likely going to spend most of our time in our beloved 4-wheel vehichles (2 wheel if you're into bikes, we got that too). And the game's car park is vast enough as well. Forza by contrast only offers cars... but a much wider selection of them.  Map activities: unlike in The Crew 1, these are not mandatory to grind in order to upgrade your car (which can take a serious amount of time if you're extremely unlycky), but there is only a goal to beat. That's it.  Sound: they're pretty good. That's judging from the Alfa Romeo Giulia, which sounds exactly like its real life counterpart, so I assume other sounds should be faithful to what they're supposed to reproduce.  Car performance upgrades: it's not good but it's still a great improvement from the previous game. Anytime you complete an event, you're guaranteed to receive a car part that's better than those already installed in your cars. And all performance parts are shareable across all vehichles in the same category, without being bound to the specific vehichle you obtained them with. You can potentially use a single high leveled car to obtain performance parts to upgrade all other similar vehichles almost instantly. Still not as good as just buying them with your own money but I'm not complaining...  Soundtrack: I can't describe how much more enjoyable this is compared to The Crew 1. I can finally play more than the only one decent song in the entire songlist.  Story: glad they ditched the story element. The plot in The Crew 1 was poor to say the least and I'd much rather have a generic motorsport event as a context than that. Annnnd this is where it's clear that this game is trying to get close to Forza Horizon. Win, progress across the various rounds of said generic competition, become the champion.  Now, to the ""meh"" parts:  Graphics: they're all but impressive. In fact it looks quite like The Crew 1. Except it even goes backwards. I'd like to know who thought it would be a good idea not to enable users to switch TAA off. The result is that the game looks like it's being run on console, extremely blurry at 1080p, like it was rendered at a lower resolution. While it can be disabled in a settings file, it breaks effects that rely on it, such as reflections. But hey, at least it will look crisp. Overall geometry detail is also mediocre. Oh, and also forced 60 FPS cap. No contest compared to Forza.  AI and difficulty: I'm getting Mario Kart flashbacks.The rubberbanding is just insane. And the difficulty balance across the events is way off. You will see opponents in front of you slowing down to let you pass only to see the same opponents zoom at godlike speeds past you once you're in front. And instead, in the RAID events, the prerecorded ghost is easy to beat, letting me win with a comfortable 40 seconds gap on average using a car with the recommended performance rating for the event.  Physics: better than the previous entry. Cars are still going to be prone to drifting and handbrake will still be useless (sending your car into an almost full stop the moment you press it and steer afterwards) but the driving experience remains overall enjoyable once you get used to it. It just... doesn't feel as natural as Forza.  Disciplines: this games does so many things at once and as a results doesn't shine in anything in particular. But being it arcade-oriented and given what I paid for it, it's not too much of a downside. It still includes and offers way more variety compared to its competitors.  Always-online: as far as I can tell, there is not too much focus on the online element... so why force us to be connected at all times? Folks with unstable internet connections such as myself don't like this you know.  In conclusion: give it a try. Not at a full price, though, or you risk feeling severely disappointed. In fact, I'd much rather pay full price on Forza than this. But overall... it's fun."

Yes, it is arcade, not supposed to be realistic, but I don't really think it should feel like your tires is not sticking to the road. 2. Confusing key mappings. It does not tell you the controls when you got thrown into your first race/demo. The pause menu is not ESC but F10. You cannot have completely separate key binding for vehicles and airplanes. 3. Graphics is all right but could be a lot better. But why there is still a 60-FPS frame limiter? 4. Not really better than The Crew 1, if not worse.  Final Thoughts: If you want to buy this mainly because of car racing, there are many more options better than this one. NFS series for arcade, Forza Horizon for semi-arcade, Assetto Corsa/Project Car 2/Forza Motorsport for simulation side.  P.S. Forza Horizon 4 is coming October, might as well just wait for that one."

136001664,english,1,646910,"[h1] Drive like you stole it! [/h1] The Crew 2 is an open-world racing game developed by Ivory Tower and published by Ubisoft. It was released in 2018 and is a sequel to the original The Crew game. The game allows players to explore a vast open-world recreation of the United States, race against other players online, and collect a variety of vehicles, including cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles.  [h2] Pros and cons [/h2] [table] [tr] [th] 🟩 Positives [/th] [th] 🟥 Negatives [/th] [/tr] [tr] 	[td] - Expansive open-world with a variety of environments to explore  - Impressive level of vehicle customisation  - Wide range of vehicles to collect, including rare and unique ones  - Well-designed vehicle models with realistic handling  - Weekly events and challenges provide a sense of progression and competition  - Impressive graphics and sound design 	[/td] 	[td] - Grindy nature of the game may be off-putting for some players  - Limited storyline and lack of compelling characters  - Some ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits  - Multiplayer PvP mode is limited to simple point-to-point races  - Some bugs and issues with the game, though most have been addressed through updates and patches. 	[/td] [/tr] [/table]	  [h2] Gameplay [/h2] The Crew 2's gameplay is enjoyable and immersive, with a strong emphasis on exploration and racing. The game's expansive open-world allows players to explore various environments, from bustling cities to scenic countryside landscapes. The game's attention to detail is impressive, with realistic handling of the different vehicles and a wide range of customisation options.  [h3] Events [/h3] The game's ""live summits"" events are weekly events where players can win vanity items or time-limited cars. However, some players may struggle to win the top prize without first obtaining cars and parts that give them an advantage. The game's multiplayer PvP mode is a simple race from point A to point B.  [h2] Vehicles [/h2] The game offers rare, unique vehicles not usually found in other racing games. The game's vehicle models are well-designed, and the level of customisation is impressive, allowing players to almost widebody every car. However, some of the game's ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits, which may be off-putting for some players.  [h2] Story [/h2] The game's story is minimal, with no clear protagonist or antagonist, and the game focuses more on exploration and racing than storytelling. However, the game's open-world and the various challenges and events provide a sense of progression.  [h2] Graphics and Sound [/h2] The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed vehicle models and environments that look and feel realistic. The game's sound design is also noteworthy, with diverse sound effects adding to the immersive experience.  [h2] Conclusion [/h2] Overall, The Crew 2 is an enjoyable and immersive racing game that offers a vast open-world, a wide range of vehicles, and various events to compete in. The game's attention to detail is impressive, and the vehicle models are well-designed with realistic handling. However, some players may find the game's grindy nature and lack of a compelling story mode to be a turnoff. Nevertheless, The Crew 2 is still a game worth playing for racing fans and those who enjoy exploring and customising their vehicles."
120846641,english,1,646910,"I tried this game when it was free for a weekend, and decided to buy it. It is a very relaxing racing game which I play after office hours.  Positives: - There is a lot of content, and not the usual boring and filler material. So many types of races, including destruction derby, bike races and boats will keep you busy. - It is easy to upgrade cars, you get a lot of materials to upgrade. Live Summit changes every week and provides good rewards so leveling up is easy. - This game has one of the best ways to display the map that I have seen in a racing game.  - On Normal level, it is an easy game, so I play the race on normal and win, then try it on hard (and win again most of the time).   Negatives:  - Ubisoft - In a lot of races, you race against a ghost and there are no other drivers. - Soundtrack is mediocre. Racing games like NFS and Forza have one of the best soundtracks, something you enjoy while driving, but not here. Very okish.  - Graphics are good, but at some places, houses look like boxes.  - Online component is dead.  I also find the plane controls pathetic, although I am not sure if others feel this too.  Overall, it is worth the money. Get the gold edition, so that you have a headstart with extra cars and content."

I have finished all of the achievements before writing this review.  Multiplayer arcade race game where you race others with cars, bikes, boats and planes with a full controller support. Characters and story are forgettable, the gameplay though is very fun. If you are looking for realism, this is not a place for you. No police, traffic light changes every 2 sec, no vehicle damage (just scratches), drag cars can reach the speed of almost 700kmh (434mph), if you put side exhaust you will still have rear one.  The game loads once, and you are ready to go! The fast restarts, smooth vehicle swap, travel to challenges etc. Amazing car details and they sound awesome (except motorcycles). Radio offers a variety of different stations so every person can find something for them to listen (and I did not know about it because of a lack of tutorial and guidance in this game). Nevertheless, the world feels empty and lacks some serious gameplay. There is almost no reason to explore the in-game world apart from taking photo opportunities. There are no collectables, few skill games and limitless highlights with top speed, high jump and long drift.   Lots of vehicles, various race types, decent co-op gameplay BUT no PvP. The Crew is all about the PvP and it is not here at launch. ""The Crew 2"" has many of the same cars but in different categories, so if you buy a car in a Street Race category, you can use it for that only compared to the first game.  You can but a Ford Mustang as a Street, Drift, Drag, Track and Monster Truck. And here comes the currency problem. I hate games with microtransactions, but at least here you can play without the urge to spend some real cash. Although the prices are ridiculously high, it is not that hard to grind it out. Performance parts will come as a loot for finishing a race (green, blue, epic and I think legendary will be added with later updates), and it will take a long time to max out a single car because you can get parts with lower performance than what you have. Rare and Epic parts will have 1 and 2 additional modifiers respectively and you can use it to boost your gameplay in many ways.  Car customisation is pretty good but it is limited to the Street Racers Family (Cars with yellow icon) and Monster Trucks. For other classes, you can only change their wheels! You can create your own livery or download one of the popular ones and at least this feature is for all of them.  The game leaves a huge levelling potential (up to 9999) but to be honest there is no reason to do so, because at 600 is your last car reward, and every 10 levels from that point are just epic loot.  Races may vary from short ones up to 40min long with a ""rubber-banding"" difficulty which can be brutal since you will drive at your limits and AI will sometimes push you around and frustrate the hell out of you.  What is a ""Rubber Banding""? - Pushes them towards you if you are far from them and lowers their speed if you are too far behind. So, if you are driving at your and car's limit, the AI (especially 2nd place) will go into hyperspeed to catch up with you. They are not that generous if you fall behind but the AI will still slow down.  Now, I want to speak of things that frustrated me the most - lack of tutorials and a car reset. The game lacks tutorial in some cases! There are so many questions and no clear explanation or indication on how to do some stuff: how to shift a drag car, where is the mailbox when to use two different modes of boats etc. The last one will be verbally explained by one of the characters but if you miss it...   Now, the car resets... It takes 2 FULL seconds to put it back on track and sometimes it will put you WAY back in the race and if you happened to make a mistake in a 40 min long race, you are royally screwed. I was 1st and one small mistake (because the game doesn't show you the raceway like it should) + reset made me the last place with a 10 sec gap to 7th place. I saved the run and finished first but I was at 30% of the race when that happened.  Although I would still recommend this game but not for a full price unless everything I have said above is fine for you. As they did with ""The Crew"" they will add more content in here and it will feel much better to play it but until then, wait for a sale.

43245527,english,1,646910,"I've seen a lot of mixed reviews, I recommend it although it isn't a perfect game.  Some people seem to complain about landmarks and graphics. I find the graphics are great, and i couldn't care less about landmarks.  The MOST important thing to keep in mind, this is an ARCADE STYLE racing game. Not a simulator. If you wanted hyper realism then look elsewhere.  - Great vehicle selection - Good controls - Extensive Customization (you can get lost in it for hours) - Reward vehicles from the previous game - Playing with friends - Larger map area - Larger selection of events to do - More content to come  Here are some flaws (some major)  - Voice acting is ridiculous. No adults speak like these do. - WHERES THE MULTIPLAYER RACES?! (I know, they said they come in December, but most of us bought the game for the MP experience) - Not enough physical damage to vehicles (they seem to have dropped the ""repair"" feature) - Transition from car to boat to plane could have been slightly smoother    Everyone has a different opinion on the game. I'm just being honest. In terms of what I expected out of the game, I got exactly what I wanted... minus the delayed PVP/Multiplayer Racing.  I recommend the game, as long as players remember this is an ARCADE STYLE racing game, and not a simulation."
72413284,english,0,646910,"TL;DR - Ok, it is not that I hate this game, but I just don't recommend it.  For what it is worth, I have fun playing, the customization is nice and the driving feels (for the most part) good. What I have the most issue with is the glitches, minor inconveniences to game breakers. At the time of posting this review, the game literally does not start despite my efforts to get it to do run beyond the title screen. There is also a rather large amount of questionable choices in regards to what you can just blow through and what will crash your vehicle. My last real complaint is the lack of police chases that were present in the first game, while it doesn't exactly fit the ""story,"" it would have been nice to have been included for more incentive to explore and drive around.  Fortunately there is a lot I do like about the game. The car selection is very nice and while I am not the biggest fan of the boat/plane additions, I could see some enjoying the features thoroughly. I also like the Summit activities, which once a week update and always give me something to come back to (while it may be just recycling races from the base game). I also never have felt a need to resort to microtransactions.   In conclusion, I do like this game, after all, there is a reason I have dumped 150+ hours into it, but if you are on the fence, I can only recommend it on a decent sale. Otherwise, Steam offers some NFS games now that may better suit what you may be looking for. Cool game, but a bit lackluster."
156581569,english,0,646910,Great game but don't feel like playing it anymore since I feel like nothing I do will matter as this game will shut down just like the first Crew title and I'll lose all progress.

94158049,english,1,646910,"What is this game like? A game with a huge world, with an abundant number of vehicles, you can explore not only land, but also air and water. The actions of the game take place in the United States of America, during the game you will have where to turn around, drift, drag, ring races, as well as races all over the map, there will be no borders in front of you. ... You can buy a car of any level, the first good car will not be long in coming. Farming money in the game happens pretty quickly, but it's no less interesting from it. The map shows major cities in the States, as well as their attractions. Simply stunning graphics, effects of water, mud, rain, sun, clouds. Also, during the game you will visit the winter season, the physics of the car will change quite noticeably, which cannot but rejoice. But there are also disadvantages, your car in the game is not titanium, a small tree, like in Forza, will not be able to knock down, when it collides with a stone, it will most likely not stop it, but throw it up. In this game, cars are more like jumpers. I think we will stop at this and will not continue talking about the shortcomings of this game, but talk about the interface and additional functions.  The game has a very simple and beautiful interface, the eye rejoices looking at the picture in the hall. Also, the game is equipped with a photo function, at any moment of movement you can stop the moment and become a real photographer. You will be able to publish your work on the official website of the game.  The game also has character customization, leveling up skills, making a model out of furniture to make everyone envy you.  In conclusion, I want to say that it is a very rich game, its advantages overlap all the disadvantages, many updates have been made to the game, as well as a battle pass, if you are not sure about buying the game, then look at its reviews on the Internet. Thanks for attention !"
43257197,english,0,646910,"Ok, gonna keep this short. Don't buy this game.  With Forza Horizon 4 just around the corner, I'd recommend waiting for that.  This game has a lot of cool ideas and neat features, but is flawed in two MAJOR ways.  1. No person that likes customizing cars wants to get their parts from random loot at the end of races. That's just cringeworthy.  2. The physics are god awful. Turning feels lazy, there is no sense of speed, everything seems to float like GTA IV, and a lot of the control is handled by assists that dont turn off. There ends up being no sense of skill involved in driving.  What the hell good is a racing game about building and racing cars, when the building is largely out of your control, and the driving is completely unsatisfying?   Also, as a nitpick, the game is capped at 60fps, and the car models are pretty damn poor compared to Forza. The lighting model in this game is awesome, thats about it."
108925094,english,1,646910,"If you like racing game, enormous map with all sorts of diversity, many cars with many customisation and regular new events, then this game is definitely for you. Be a fearless racer or just fun chill driver, this game offers me so many things."

How long do we have, maybe another 2 to 3 years for this game? Possibly even less because of your focus on the other game? I don't like modern Forza games, but at least they let you play their older games even without an online connection. If you can't even do that for your consumers, then why bother make anymore games?"
84255376,english,0,646910,"This game was once a haven, once a miracle. It was an actually good racing game in the modern era. A rarity. But then The Chase happened. Before The Chase released in November 2020, I played this game almost every single day. I no-lifed it, grinded out every event, car, part, you name it. It was my favorite game. Then The Chase came along and ruined everything. It removed the ways to get the secondary currency (Crew Credits) by doing Daily tasks. Instead, the only way to get this currency now? Pay REAL MONEY. They also added the ""Motorpass"" system which locks a ton of content behind a paywall. These mechanics are horrific and make the game feel like a F2P, but it's a paid game! Absolutely ridiculous. I, along with many players, stopped playing after The Chase released and permanently changed the game for the worse. I finally came back to it a few days ago just for the game to almost explode my GPU because the PC port of this game is absolutely atrocious for optimization and decided ""enough is enough. It's time to let go."" I will be uninstalling the game after posting this review, but before I do let me run down every reason why you should not play this game, or at least be very weary about doing so.  -Optimization. I have a very decent rig, and yet this game THROTTLES my computer. Not to mention the game constantly crashes, and sometimes will lock up your computer for upwards of 20 minutes by doing so. If you still want to play this game after reading this, PLEASE consider playing a console port instead. As I said, this game could very well cause damage to your computer if you don't take caution. The game almost caused my GPU to break before I uninstalled it.  -Monetization. As I said in the first part of this review, The Chase introduced very predatory microtransactions into the the game. They are not forced, but they lock a lot of content behind a paywall and try to bait you into buying it. Very scummy.  -Repetition/Bland single player experience. The single player experience gets very repetitive and boring. The game has a very obvious bias to Street Racer events. There are 50 different Street Race events in the game. For perspective, no other class in the game breaks 20 unique events. Most classes don't break *10*. The game advertises itself as having tons of different vehicles and event types, but really it only focuses on Street Race. This applies to updates too, as 90% of the new events and cars that get added are Street Race or Hypercar class. On top of all of this, the singleplayer ai is ridiculously easy. The ""Races"" are more or less time trials with ai. Do not expect a challenging and enthralling singleplayer experience.  -Lack of understanding between devs and players. The devs do NOT listen to the feedback of the players, they just do as they please. The community went up in flames after The Chase, but the devs issued one statement that boiled down to ""we don't care, keep whining"". They do not listen. They do not care. The playerbase means nothing to them besides a means to make money. Do not expect the devs to do the right thing.  -Lack of variety. For a game that advertises itself for being diverse and varied, it sure isn't. The basegame gave us some variety sure, but all the content updates add the most generic and boring cars possible. Not to mention that other vehicle types such as boats, planes, bikes, etc NEVER get new content. They might add a new bike once every few months, but you will never see new boats or planes or other vehicles. And yet they will add pointless reskins of existing cars that nobody asked for all day long... They very obviously only care about adding the most predictable and uninteresting vehicles possible, so don't let the promise of variety fool you. You could easily get a similar car list out of other franchises.  -Boring events. This goes back to the boring and repetitive nature of the game, but most of the events are very boring and uninteresting layouts. There's a few good ones, but most of the tracks are extremely simple and easy. Very few sharp turns or hairpins, no traffic in races, overly long and tedious, etc. The ai will not pose a threat, and the track layouts will bore you to death after you play for a while.  -Empty and bland map. Lots of copy/paste in the map, lots of stretches of empty road, lots of areas lacking detail and feeling soullessly void of life, lots of extremely condensed towns and cities, it just feels like a very cheap map and is actually a downgrade from The Crew's map. No joke, look it up on YouTube. They downgraded the map bewteen games and it shows. A lot.  I had positive things to say about this game some months back, but all of my good will and love for the game has evaporated. I will still list some of the good things this game does however, just to be fair.  -Livery Editor. It has a good livery editor. I made plenty of detailed skins in my time playing the game. It's not the best, but it's pretty good. You can easily make good stuff with it and it's fairly limitless.  -Decent physics. They aren't phenominal and they certainly have their bad moments, but overall the physics are pretty light and fun. Rallycross cars especially are fun to just take on some dirt roads and rip it up with.  -Playability. You can't blow through the entire game in a few days, it does keep you coming back to play more. Money rewards are fairly low to make you work for what you want. The issue being that it takes that to an extreme and ends up becoming a bit tedious and boring. It has enough to keep you coming back, but maybe a bit too much.  Would I reccomend this game? No. Not anymore. I would and have reccomended the game to many people and friends since it came out in 2018, but after the last few months of the game's life I cannot support it anymore. Things started falling off in Summer 2020, but The Chase in Nov 2020 sealed it's fate. No longer can I enjoy this game, or advise others to play it. If you *still* want to play it, please do not play the PC version. You will regret it. Buy a console port, like PS4 or Xbox. They are far more stable (but still have issues. I played on PS4 and still had the game crash). I would seriously advise you to save your money, or maybe watch the updates for a few months in hopes that the studio gets their act together and brings the game back to it's glory days of 2019. I hope this review helps at least one person understand that this game is not what it once was, and that their money is better spent elsewhere.  TLDR: The game used to be really good but from Summer 2020 until now it has gotten progressively worse to the point where it's no longer worth playing. Buy something else or wait a few months to see if they fix the game with update, but  don't hold your breath."

You can't play it anymore, and they need some good reputation at the moment.

43146875,english,0,646910,"PREFACE: If you're wondering why I already have this many hours even though the game just launched hours ago, it is because I purchased the Ultimate Edition, and was able to play 3 days early via Early Access. Also, I put in over 200 hours into the first game of the series on Xbox One, and put in about 20+ hours into Beta for this game. I skipped through everything I was able to do in the Beta, and grinded my way up to Icon, so that I felt I had enough experience to make this review.  GAMEPLAY: This is where this game shines. I thoroughly enjoy the driving in this game. I came into it expecting to hate the boats/airplanes, and thought about ignoring them altogether, but instead I fell in love with them. I refuse to fast travel (except for the parts that I completed in the Beta), but now I find myself boating and/or flying to almost every race. The most important mechanic is the driving, and that feels great. Every vehicle in the game appears to drive differently, and have a unique weight that gives a great feeling to driving.   One of the biggest complaints of the Beta was how you could grind the rails and not lose any speed whatsoever, but Ubi has seemed to fix that at this point. Being in a vehicle is fun in this game, and that is important, considering that this is a racing game. Rubberbanding is a huge issue though, and detracts from the races themselves. The first title thrived on cross-country races, but what's the point of a 40 minute race, if only the last minute is all that matters? This needs to be sorted out. It almost encourages you to sit behind first place and conserve your nitrous until the last second.  The thing that can make gameplay SO aggravating is the GPS. They completely removed the arrows that you used to be able to follow on top of the screen. Now all you get is the tiny GPS off to the bottom right corner of the screen, and sometimes it can be impossible to follow, especially at extremely fast speeds. Unfortunately, that is not the only problem with the GPS. Half the time it doesn't even work, and just gives you a straight line to the location, and you have no idea how to get where you are going, so opt to fly there.  STORY/CHARACTERS: There is no story. A lot of people thought the story from the first game was quite boring, but was this really the solution for that? The characters serve no purpose, and bring no attachment to who they are. Right now this game is a single-player grind fest. Also, I don't know who did the animations for the characters in the game, but it looks like they hired the BioWare B-Team that did Mass Effect Andromeda. It's bad.  MULTIPLAYER: It is nonexistent. You can hook up with friends and drive around, but that is the ONLY form of multiplayer in the game, besides leaderboards for races. The fact that this game launched without PvP is an insult to the consumer. How can a game possibly be sold as an MMO-lite racer with no PvP? Right now the grind is for nothing, and we have no solid launch date for PvP. If you are looking to do online races, then do not purchase this game yet.  VISUALS: This game is beautiful. But only certain aspects. They nailed the two most important parts of racers, and that is the cars and lighting. The cars look absolutely stunning, and is a huge leap in the right direction for the series, even more than the last game's Wild Run expansion. Ironically, I also noted lighting as looking good. And that's true.....partially. The god rays in this game are among the best I've seen in a vanilla game. The lighting of the sky always captures the mood, and is generally quite gorgeous. Where does the lighting fail? In the headlights. It is IMPOSSIBLE to see in the dark, unless you are in a lit city. The distance of your headlights is a problem the community has raised since the Alpha state, but nothing appears to have been fixed in that area.  The landscapes are quite pretty, but what ruins it are the popins. Yes I have a GTX 1060, but look at any review. This is a problem across all platforms, even for people with 1080 TIs. Ubi has addressed this, saying that it had something to do with the draw distance forced by allowing planes in the game, but in truth, this does nothing but prove that Ubi is acknowledging that their game is not fully optimized, even though it is now launch day. I think it's pretty unacceptable to have a 1080 TI not be able to handle the popins, even when at 1080p.  The water is gorgeous, and is one of the saving graces for the environment. One of the reasons I travel by boat so much in this game is because the water is pretty, unique, fun, and doesn't have all the foliage popins.   The worst part about the graphics in this game are the buildings. They look like Legos, like something out of a game that came in the previous decade. It's so weird having a game that looks so beautiful in some aspects, but absolutely abysmal in others.  AUDIO: The audio in this game has caused a bunch problems for me. The amount of bugs is crazy. Half the time you will hear a car coming up right behind you, only to look behind you and see no one. Also if you crash into objects in the world, there is a bug that repeats the crashing sound on end until you pause the game.   The voice acting is pretty unfortunate. A lot of voices didn't match their faces/animations, and it sounds like Ubi just picked up random people off the street, used a subpar mic, and gave them really bad and cheezy lines to say.  The cars do sound nice, and especially the backfiring of cars can be really satisfying.  The music within the game's radiostations are also much more satisfying than the original game's.  ECONOMY: This game's economy has been VERY inconsistent from the start. Many cars didn't match each other in terms of price, and although they have addressed this slightly, the problem still rings true.  So, is the game P2W? Yeah. It definitely is. Right now, you can purchase a 2nd form of currency, and buy any car you want. I'm not saying microtransactions are the worst thing in the world, but when they are taken further than just cosmetics, I tend to have a problem with it. Right now you can spend extra cash, and compete on the leaderboards with any car in the game from the get-go. Imagine if PvP was actually in this game? Ubi is practically encouraging players to spend money to get everything from the start, and discouraging them from actually even playing the game at all.  VALUE: I'd say it would take the average player about 20 hours to get Icon, and unlock mostly everything in the game. You can get more time of course by grinding out the Icon ranks and such, but I would only see players doing this in prepping for PvP. By using the Dollar per Hour scale, that costs the average consumer about $3 per hour. That's not terrible value, but if this game launched without missing content, you would get much more value per dollar. At least most won't get the Ultimate edition like I did and decrease the value even more.  FINAL THOUGHTS: The Crew launched as a an absolute mess. I don't think that anyone will say otherwise, even Ubisoft. It showed by how much effort they put into resurrecting that game from the dead. They updated the graphics, and also put out two of the best expansions in recent video game history besides the Witcher 3. To me, The Crew launched at about a 4/10. That's how much of a mess that game was. After Ubisoft fixed it, they got it to about an 8.5 in my books. I picked it up for free on Games with Gold, and it quickly became my favorite racing game after all of the expansions. And yes, this is coming from a Forza fanboy. The Crew had a slow start, but eventually gave itself a solid foundation for a sequel. Unfortunately what we got was a game with much better mechanics, yet stripped of all of it's basic content. It is with a heavy heart that I have to give such a bad review of my most anticipated game of the year, that's not named Smash Bros. Ultimate.  VERDICT: 6.5/10  TL;DR: Don't buy yet."
174689773,english,1,646910,"I have a feeling that this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car, and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies. Still worth the price tho, beautiful graphics and racists"
83579628,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is a whisker away from being a great game. You can spend an entire afternoon just enjoying the cars and driving without a specific purpose, while taking in some of the marvelous views, and it feels really good. However, the major downsides - ubiquitous copy-pasting and a rather scant number of genuine innovations  - don't allow me to recommend this game to absolutely everyone -  not just yet.  ⭐⭐⭐✰✰"
153623491,english,0,646910,"Just as a disclaimer, the Crew series is actually not bad, but for anyone who hasn’t noticed this yet, yesterday Ubisoft spontaneously delisted The Crew 1 and also announced that the game will be shutdowned and unplayable after March ’24. Sorry, this is absolutely inexcusable. They tried this with their DLCs last year (but rowed back due to the sh**storm), yet seriously, now this again??!! Don’t get me wrong, The Crew 1 is actually a great game which has quite some single player story content, obviously even an offline mode is integrated hidden in the files (due to some programmers in the community who are working on a mod, see the forum discussions), so there’s obviously no real reason to not give us customers (who paid for all those expensive season passes and DLCs) an offline function. Ubisoft really needs to stop their extremely toxic anti-consumer behavior, because meanwhile even I (I always defended them in the past) am losing interest in their products. And another joke, if you want to complain at the moment, there’s even no official Ubisoft internet forum anymore, only one on Discord (where all discussions get lost anyway). Uggh, sorry, this just had to get out, it’s just super frustrating.   And regarding The Crew 2, yeah, if we tolerate this behavior, The Crew 2 will go the same way, as will probably go a lot of other Ubisoft games with multiplayer online integration."
174895903,english,1,646910,"Alright. [i]The Crew 2[/i]. Judging from the current all-time high concurrent peak player counts for the game, I'd say a lot of people are aware of this game currently being priced at one dollar (and less in some regions). And a lot of people have bought the game as a result of this stunning deal. Including myself. Just to get it out of the way, if you have something to say about The Crew 1's removal, go to the game forum. I'm not interested in the topic as part of this review. So...  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984820  I am confident I would never have bought this game had it not been a buck, and I'm also confident that a lot of people have the same opinion. But since it was a buck, I did in fact buy it, and I'm glad I did. It's hella fun. The gameplay loop of joining events and races, using the cash you earn to buy new vehicles and such, and upgrading your vehicles with loot rewards from events and races, is pretty simple. But it is also effective. As you progress, you will unlock more events and races, and because they are located across the lower 48 States, you get a wide variety of settings for everything. From cities to mountains to forests to lakes to deserts to meteor craters to rain to snow to beaches and on and on, there is a vast array of different types of courses and tracks to enjoy. And there are a wide variety of types of races and events as well. From standard track races to boat races to plane aerobatics to demolition derbies, and so on.  The sheer volume of content is quite impressive. And, the various vehicles, be they cars or trucks or bikes or planes or boats or dune buggies or whatever...they all handle nicely and feel good to drive in. Each of these is upgradeable in many ways, which will increase their performance, handling, speed, and just generally make them function better and better as you progress.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984770  There is a campaign of sorts, where you try to become the lead racer in a few different styles, but it's also easy enough to ignore that in favor of simply racing around, upgrading your vehicles, wandering around your crib, and simply free roaming. And free roaming is a lot of fun in and of itself. Mostly, it's a huge sightseeing trip, where you can also try to beat other player's records with jumps, speed, and so on; that you come across while driving around. And setting some records of your own for other people to beat. And there is a decent photography mini game all across the States where you will take pictures of animals, special vehicles and such to gain more cash and follower.  And gaining followers is really the sub goal that most impacts your playthrough. The number of followers you have determines how popular your racer is, which in turn unlocks new vehicle options and race/event options. Just about everything you do will earn you new followers (and cash).  Also, you can play with other players and even if you're not, you will see them all over the map. At this moment in time (the time of this review being written), no matter where you are, somebody else is nearby. And there are a lot of player created activities as well. Plus, you can co-op with friends if you get bored of solo play. So really, the content just keeps expanding as you explore what the game has to offer.  Visually, the game looks great. It has a 60 FPS cap, which isn't anything to brag about, but somehow, the devs have made the most out of that limitation and made a game that has a never-ending supply of screenshot moments. The audio is also well done. The songs themselves are very cool. The dialogue is basically all ""hey bro"" Extreme Games fodder, but it's fun and definitely appropriate.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3330111663  You will need Ubisoft Connect to play this. I don't care at all about that, but you might. And some people are having an issue with the game crashing if they have other non-Steam clients linked to their Ubi account. I have not had that issue personally and have it linked to both PSN and Epic as well, but if you do, you will need to unlink everything except Steam and that will resolve the crashing issue apparently. No idea how or why that is what it is or why it only affects some players. It's been a bug free experience for me though with a 3070 and an i5.  Now, should you also buy the season pass? I personally have no intention of doing so. There's no new content, and I don't care about getting a few extra cars and some swag. But the base game, offering what can easily be hundreds and even thousands of hours of content for one dollar. That is something I can definitely get behind. I can't think of a better deal in gaming at this moment. Now, if you miss or skip this one-dollar promotion they have going on right now, value will be more of...you know..., a [i]your mileage may vary[/i] type thing....

174302344,english,1,646910,"Forza Horizon fan.  Having fun in Crew 2 with all the different vehicle and event types.  C2 runs smooth, no bugs, and each event type is well designed and implemented.  Only frustration, I did not reach Platinum division in the Summit my first week. Being rich in Forza means you can buy and tune a competitive vehicle.  In Crew 2, you buy the base vehicle, but you have to grind for upgrade parts.   FH has classes (B, A, S1, S2).  C2 does not.  All vehicles of same type in C2 have same max tune value. FH no Nitro, C2, Nitro is primary factor. C2, no Auction House nor any way to sell vehicles. C2, leaderboards are more integral, and are a focus of endgame/seasons (Summit). I have over 700 vehicles in FH5.  In C2 earning vehicles is a MUCH slower process, and so far, I don't see much incentive to collect cars, beyond appearance and Summit requirements.  Do different Street Race cars handle differently at max stats??  excluding part affixes and awd."
43308733,english,0,646910,"If I had to sum up this game in one word, that word would be ""inconsistent"". The core racing experience is fun, and the open-world is still a thrill to just fly, race and drift around. However, there are definetly some irks that hold it back:  ""That's solid? really?"" - you'll find yourself saying this a fair bit, unfortunately. Whilst bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts and even traffic fold up like they're made of crisps and ping off into space, trees and parked cars are merciless, utterly solid, and occasionally placed exactly where you think you can get that little shortcut.  The AI: Rubberband doesnt even sum the AI up. In fact, it's barely worth trying to drive fast, as they will ALWAYS catch up to you and press their hidden hyperspace buttons the second you overcook a corner. Incredabily frustrating sometimes when you've been in the lead for 95% of the race, then get taken out by a suprise bus on the last corner and finish stone-dead last. Hard mode races up the challenge significantly, but dont be surprised to see the AI disappear over the draw distance within 10 seconds of the start if you havn't grinded out those upgrades for your vehicles.  The Story: If I had to guess, I'd say The Crew 2 was designed to be faaaar more ambitious in it's storytelling. The cutscenes and dialogue you get occasionally before or after a race feel really disjointed, as if there's a big chunk of the story you missed somewhere. One place it particularly confised me was one of the Rival races, where suddenly the mentor who's been urging you on all this time suddenly heel turns so rapidly it's surprising he doesnt do himself an injury, and opens a cutscene by telling your mechanic, Hiro, that you've somehow betrayed him and he wants a race... by doing what he wanted you to and winning races... huh? It just made me confused. Add to this the artsy cutscenes full of pseudo-philosophical commentary that honestly makes zero sense to pop up when they do, and overall the impression that there was a lot of story removed that might have linked these sections together can't be ignored.  There is a lot of good though. The racing is fun, the sensation of speed is excellent, the environments (especially out in the countryside with deserts and the Grand Canyon) are gorgeous and run well, and it really shines when you're just having fun in the open world. Just not in Monster Trucks. Never Monster Trucks. They just... no. horrible.  To sum up, there is a huge amount of potential here. It just needs filling out, and as such in it's present state I can't really recommend it for full price. Maybe after a few updates, it will start to fulfil it's potential. So who made this game again? Oh. Ubisoft. Don't count on the potential being filled then."

43274957,english,0,646910,"Disgusting rubberbanding makes the game so un-enjoyable. Race perfectly and the ai will be right behind you the entire time even if your vehicle is 50 points faster. Of course it's the same the other way around as well, you can eat shit in a ditch and be right behind the leader of the race 10 seconds later because they basically slow down to a crawl if you fall behind, which is incredible because as soon as you pull ahead of them by 5-6 seconds the ai can start to take perfect turns going twice as fast as you like the car is on rails instead of tires. Even worse is the fact that the game punishes you for using your breaks. It's legitimately faster to ride the side rail of a corner and hold the boost than to bother to slow down and take a proper turn.  PSA: I'm honestly super surprised I actually have to explain this here but to everyone commenting about the problem being connection or cpu or w/e else, rubberbanding ai is not a term for lagging. Rubber band AI refers to a feature of artificial intelligence found in racing titles that is designed to prevent players from getting too far ahead of computer-controlled opponents.   Edit: I'm making a sidenote for all the people who are real grumpy about the bad reviews, the base of the game itself is nice. It feels great to freeroam around the map. The physics could have used a bit more tuning but aside from that the cars control as you would expect from a good arcade racer. The problem lies beyond that in the ai. The oponents can decide to hit warpspeed to catch up to you whenever they damn well please. It's not as obvious in disciplines like hypercar racing and the F1 syle discipline, but street races are absolutely atrocious to play. I honestly believe if Ubi went back and fixed some of their problems the game could be great, but as it is, it feels like a big mess. Also, always online game and no PvP for another 5-6 months is a pathetic joke."

50261820,english,0,646910,"I played the game in 4k on a 3080 with an XBOneX Pro controller. All detail was maxed except AA and blur. I do not recommend a keyboard and mouse.  PLEASE NOTE, even though I have left comments on, I am not interested in you telling me that I should put 4000 hours into a game I don't enjoy so I can ""git good"", and then I would like it. That is a stupid argument. Don't be stupid. Skill is not indicative of enjoyment, and I have better things to do than bash my head on what I personally feel are bad / mediocre games on the off chance I could maybe like them one day. I have a life and don't play games to develop Stockholm syndrome.  Neutrals: - There are 25-minute single races. In an arcade racing game. I hated this. You may not.  Pros: - Most of the time, it ran at 60 FPS. - Large map, but...  Cons: - There is little to see on the map that's interesting. Sometimes the trees change type, and maybe there's more water in an area. - The upgrade system is painfully bad and is essentially a lootbox minus a box. You win a race, you get some random upgrades. You can have, say, LVL 65 in every part but one and it may take you 20 races to get an upgrade for that slot. Yes, you can get RNG'd into having to grind races to upgrade. It's as bad as it sounds. - VERY hard to read tracks when racing. Sometimes you'll just go in the wrong direction because you have no clue where you are intended to go. You essentially have to watch the minimap because watching the race itself is useless as the tracks are signposted more poorly than any other racing game I've played in recent memory. - The AI is tuned incredibly poorly. Either they're WAY ahead of you even though you're driving a better car and the race is half your level, or you're absolutely demolishing them. There is no adjusting this. It is infuriating. - All the cars control like they're racing on butter. Everything slides uncontrollably and really shows off how shoddy the physics are in this game. You will constantly careen into stuff. And speaking of... - Hitting damn near anything brings you to a complete stop. You don't slide past stuff like other arcade racing games when the corner of your car clips a bush, you come to a complete halt. You now have to restart the race because you WILL NOT catch up. Is the race 12 minutes long? Too bad. Now to find that race reset... - The menus are awful. I had to actually Google how to restart a race and quit the game. Thought they'd be in the in-game menus? Hah, you simpleton! You have to hit Y to bring up a special menu that hides in the corner of the screen, but only comes up while driving! Want that menu on a keyboard & mouse? NOPE! Those buttons sometimes show up at the bottom of a different menu where you may have expected them in the first place! Well, sometimes. Only when the option for the buttons feels like appearing. Sometimes it just doesn't. - The characters are astoundingly annoying and are written to speak like a Red Bull commercial. The overtly positive ""might as well be saying nothing at all"" style garbage non-speaking flows out of everyone's mouth continually. The story is non-existant. If you love chasing ""followers"" (ugh), then go on Instagram and be vapid there. Even the shell of a life you pretend to have there will be more fun than The Crew 2. - Very odd and frequent framerate drops when physics items interact with each other. This happens often. Adjusting settings did not help. - It looks worse than the original did somehow, and the first was quite an ugly game. - One of the worst game soundtracks I've heard since Gone Home. This low-budget mess of a soundtrack complete with incredibly shrill lady-punk songs. The only good song on the soundtrack is Airbourne - Running Wild, and it's over 10 years old. Yes that's an opinion, and your mileage may vary. - I am an idiot and preordered the Gold Edition because, hey, this is a sequel. It's going to improve on the original in many ways. (Narrator: ""It did not."") They didn't listen to a single damn complaint about the original, even though nearly every review both professional and amateur said the same things (Many of which are pointed out in my review here). This makes me madder. You couldn't even be bothered to fix the obvious? Bad form, Ubisoft. - They haven't improved on any of these complaints since launch and instead insist on putting out boring Live Events. This is because Live games make more money (See Destiny). Make no mistake, this is a product, not art and it definitely wants all of your money. - I genuinely tried to like it and power through some of the issues, but I just can't any more. I hate this game. It is one of the worst racing games I have played in recent memory. Even the two most recent Need For Speed games were better, and they were mediocre at the best of times.  UPDATE: Tried it again several years down the road. Holy god there is so much seasonal crap slathered everywhere, and random things to level that they're trying to sell you it was nearly impossible to figure out what to do next. This somehow got even grosser than it was. Oh, and even though the menus have changed, they now make LESS sense due to the sheer amount of layered-on garbage that, AND I still couldn't find a way to quit. I had to Alt + F4."
43211268,english,0,646910,"This game is an improvement over the first one which I defended to be honest. The addition of planes and boats was a great one.  However, I won't give this game a postiive review because Ubisoft intentionally downgraded the game. By that I speak of landmarks. Of all the landmarks they had in The Crew 1, they were all very accurate in terms of shape and relative location. They even had the same ones in the E3 demo. But they decided to remove a lot of them or make them inaccurate for no good reason. If it is a technical reason, it is pure lazyness on the devs part and they jusst used a cheap dirty workaround to fix an issue they had.  I am quite disappointed with the map downgrades. I feel that rather than removing the landmarks, they should have created accurate new ones to further enhance the cities. I will admit the random buildings do look better in this game but the lack of landmarks irritates me.    -In New York the Metlife building, Yankee Stadium, Chrysler Building etc were removed, and the Empire State building was replaced with an inaccurate model. -In Detroit the bridge crossing over to Candida was removed. -In Los Angeles, the City Bank building was altered and is no longer accurate. -The military base north of Chicago was removed. -Downgrades made which decrease the detail to the Hoover Dam  Now Chicago, my home town, got hit hard by the pointless downgrading. About 70 percent of the landmarks were removed. -Sears Tower was removed (Even non Chicago natives will notice this one. Bad decision. Makes me wonder what is wrong with the dev/designer who thought that was a good idea.) -Thompson Center was removed -LaSalle Street Metra was station removed -United Center is gone -Solder Field is gone -The Diamond Building is also gone -The airport was removed (REALLY BAD choice giving the fact the game now has airplanes) -The accurate recreation of Navy Pier was replaced by a bunch of the random filler buildings and props you see all over the map. They are munched together like some kid would make if the game had some kind of map editor which let you place buildings. -The curved building where the river forks was removed. (Forgot the name) -Skyscraper directly south of Sears Tower removed (Also forgot the name) -The Chase Bank building is gone.   What makes me mad is that it is the same map as the first game. You will get a better US road trip experiance in The Crew 1 as the cities featured actually look like the way they are supposed to. They intentionally downgraded it. This game has good gameplay, but screwing up the map makes me belive this game is incomplete and therefore doesn't get a positive review. I'll change my review when Ubisoft restores the content they removed intentionally.  Once Ubisoft corrects their dumb mistakes and gives us the United States road trip experiance that The Crew 1 had, I will change my review."

50314368,english,0,646910,"Crew 2 was controversial at start and ran out of content in 3 months, lost its playerbase in 5 months, Season Pass has been nothing but a scam. About year after launch, big update comes with three new cars (wow!) and MICROTRANSACTIONS (they are only cosmetic and premium currency can be obtained in some ways but donating is much easier). It's Ubisoft, remember, no fun allowed. Even the first Crew had a better potential of holding playerbase with different bodykits to all cars and good crate system even considering the fact that it wasn't at release. Honestly, whole economic system in Crew 2 is messed up, money are really hard to get and best cars cost horribly high, even though $1,4kk car can show similar or even worse performanse than $350k due to ""pro settings"" and parts which you can switch between cars of the same class and which define the most of car's stats, all you're buying is basically a skin with some advantages (base stats are slightly different nonetheless). Open-world activities are ok, but not profitable, and not all races are profitable as well. There are a lot of them, and developers even add some every now and then, but the main problem is that you are granted with no rewards by completing certain percentage of all races in one class, so there is no point completing all of them - you only get vehicle reward after you beat any story boss, but all you get is mediocre car and trash helicopter which you can't even use in a race. It's easier to find a good relaxing race and farm money there 'till you faint and it seems that it's what most players do. I can't feel a soul in Crew 2. Making matters worse, it's just fucking tedious and grind-based mediocre car game. This vomitous scheme ""Grind money to get a better car to grind more money using it"". No immersion effect (as in FH4), bad car handling and collision physics, terrible optimisation with painful launches and many, many other bad things. It's year after, not the release date state. When hearing news about Ubisoft making a live-service you should await a death-service."
43572491,english,0,646910,"As I played about 200+ hours in The Crew 1 I have to admit that in The Crew 2 I got bored after 20 hours already.  So let's talk about the things:  1. Price - way too much for this game. Wait for a sale if you REALLY want to play it BADLY. I didn't have fun when playing this game, which shocked me though, because The Crew 1 brought me so much fun. Very disappointing.  2. Map - landmarks are gone, they kinda replaced it with Photo Albums, which is not that bad, however it's kinda annoying (at least for me). Map is huge, but feels totally empty and unused, since they took fast travel to random places away and the map is unlocked, since the beginning, so not much of a grind to be fair. 3. AI - feels really weird sometimes. Sometimes it works normally and sometimes it's just impossible. I had the most issues with Drag Racing where I actually had to watch tutorials to have a chance to beat someone on normal (and no i'm not a total noob, the timing is just so crucial that you need to learn it, which is ridiculous). For beginners the AI is way too OP. If you new and want to have fun you will get frustrated really quickly.  4. Vehicles - probably the biggest plus in this game. There's a wide range of cars, etc., however, with all the classes (boats, planes) it doesn't feel like a REAL racing game anymore. 5. Story - Overall cringe atmosphere, a forced ""legal"" environment with big parties all over the freaking country. All nice places, which I enjoyed in The Crew 1 just for the nature are now covered with stupid banners and fancy lights, etc. etc. which takes the feeling away. The whole ""story"" is just a collection of short events, which are apparently huge in the so called TV.  6. Miscellaneous - The followers are replacement of the XP, which is not tragic, but probably annoyed many players who played TC1. The stupid chants after every race or completed skill and music is just annoying.   Overall it's a huge disappointment, there's not much room for grind. I completed all the races for all categories + all skills on 100 % in about 20 hours. I could do the photo albums and buy all vehicles, but the game is just not fun.  If you're new and you want to give it a try wait for a sale. If you're a passioned racing gamer or you played The Crew 1 don't buy this game. That's my OWN OPINION."
43432845,english,0,646910,"Pros: 1. Graphics are ok, but could have been better for a 2018 game. 2. Good car selection and upgrades.  Cons:  1. Cringeworthy voice acting and poorly made cutscenes. 2. Car handling feels like you are driving on snow. 3. Poor wheel support, at least they tried to improve it though. 4. Story is nonexistent, feels like they put a random plot on the last stages of the game. 5. Landmarks from the first game are gone. 6. AI is awful. 7. Map is huge but feels so empty, also the game unlocks the entire map by default so the game don't give you a reason to explore it.  Resuming: Not worth the full price, buy it in a sale and hope you have some fun with it.  FOR THOSE WHO SAY I ONLY PLAYED 0.8HRS OF THE GAME I played the beta on UPlay and my playtime says I have 6 hours on it. It's basically the same game."
43673830,english,0,646910,"[b]What it is:[/b] A massive open-world driving game that boasts the greatest map ever made in its genre but is screaming for more polish in virtually every aspect.  [b]What it does well:[/b] [list] [*]That map - a 1:40 scale recreation of the United States lifted from the original game but updated to accommodate essentially every type of motorized mobility with unparalleled variety [*]A genuinely liberating sense of freedom from a game structured to reward you for doing virtually anything in any vehicle anywhere (except for the PvP) [*]The [i]second[/i]-best game on the planet for relaxation behind Microsoft Flight Simulator - The Crew 2 is at its best not when you're racing but when you're treating it as a giant high-speed walking simulator with no story to speak of [*]An amusingly varied vehicle list that goes from the usual genre staples to things like a biplane, a helicopter, a hovercraft, and more [*]An equally varied array of activity types to engage in - including drift and drag races, aerial stunt challenges, monster truck arenas, demolition derbies, and more [*]A great photo mode held back only by the game's own visual inconsistencies [*]The weekly summits provide a fairly compelling reason to regularly revisit the game to do more than just cruise and chill out [*]Free updates for 29 months and counting [/list]  [b]What it fluffs:[/b] [list] [*]Despite already having hundreds of races in the game, the map still feels underused with loads of unused open spaces and roads [*]No open-world PvP races - a feature that existed in 2007's Test Drive Unlimited [*]No open-world or multiplayer police chases [*]A loot system that seems to be entertaining and somewhat addictive at first, but eventually proves to be generally pointless outside of some top-tier gear sets [*]The environments feel really dated now the second you stop to look, and both draw distance and LOD handling could use an improvement [*]As of late 2020, nights are [i]still[/i] ""broken"" by design and way too bright due to the developers' inability to properly implement car headlights [*]Strange vehicle physics engine that still doesn't know how to handle collisions convincingly [*]A cheating AI that relies only on stupid levels of rubberbanding to stay competitive [*]Strange UI/UX decisions - chief among them the refusal to save your location upon quitting the game and always forcing you to start each session either at home or an HQ [*]This game has an exceptional number of vehicle types for you to enjoy, but the number of vehicles available in each type is actually pretty underwhelming [*]Horrible story and writing with the only saving grace being how easily they can all be ignored [*]The updates may be free, but content is delivered as a painfully slow drip feed and a lot of the ""new"" cars are just reskins of the old ones [*]Paywalled seasonal content that doesn't seem to offer any real value [/list]  [b]Technical stuff:[/b] [list] [*]Disappointingly capped at 60fps like its predecessor, but it stays locked at 60fps quite easily too [*]Tons of environmental graphical assets that look like they're from 15 years ago if you stop to look and yet still pass for good looking when you're rolling by at 320km/h [*]Almost complete ultrawide support - HUD and UI are not stretched but remain confined to 16:9 screen space [*]Occasional minor connectivity issues [*]For some reason may become unstable when played with a Bluetooth controller [*]If you have two controllers connected to your PC (e.g. Xbox pad and flight stick), remove one before you start playing because this game idiotically takes input from all devices simultaneously [/list]  [b]Recommendation:[/b] The Crew 2 does do the basics right, but none of those basics can compete with what's on offer in Forza Horizon titles. You're basically here for the map or nothing else, and even that amazing map remains underutilized. The graphics engine appears in need of an overhaul as some serious issues involving pop-in and brightness at night remain unsolved almost two years after launch. It's a good buy for those who loved the first Crew - and its spiritual predecessors, the two Test Drive Unlimited games - and no one else."
45881599,english,1,646910,a decent casual open world racing game. recommended for people looking for such an experience.  pros - huge open world.entire map of usa slightly scaled down to explore. you can have a big road trip on your own or with friends. vehicle variety - the game is not limited to cars alone but boats planes and bikes as well. lots of different racing disciplines - ranging from street racing to grand prix to moto cross and rally cross. also featured is a cross country hyper car race - goes from east coast to west coast.40 minutes for a single lap race covering the entire width of usa. a great experience in itself. leisurely driving across the grand canyon or other such iconic places has its own novelty. acquiring the cars and upgrading them is satisfying. the set races are well made. snow and rain look nice. graphically the game is good but not upto the standards of other modern racing games like forza  cons -  game is completely arcadish with 0 damage functionality and the physics are very simplistic.its not meant for realistic racing at all. no real pvp features yet (there is an update in the works but no idea how or what it will be)
118350135,english,1,646910,Let me start this off by saying if you only plan on playing with a controller go for it which is why i'm recommending it ONLY if you're using a controller   If you have a sim rig or even just a basic setup with a wheel you will be extremely disappointed. The force feedback literally makes no sense. You'll be taking a corner and when the rear end slightly slips out from under you the force feedback just decides to fu*k off in a direction that makes no sense. There's an insane amount of options missing that would be in any racing game whether it's an arcade racer or sim with wheel support.   Next issue is the fact that for everyone on PC you are limited to 60 fps with no work around.....like...WHAT!?!? Iv'e literally never played a game on PC that limited my frames to that of a console. What was the thought process behind this decision?   Interface controls moving around the map with a wheel is extremely frustrating but you can get used to it  I have to scroll through every single wheel till I find the ones I want as there are no filter options unless I missed something but come on guys   On the vehicle selection screen there's these flashy light things grazing across the car tabs and is super annoying / makes it hard to see what you're looking at  Some of the cars wheels maximum size still are too small and makes the tires look like they should be on a rally car  Just because we have a sim rig doesn't mean we are limited to sim racers. Sometimes we just want to screw around in an open world environment and zone out which Horizon is great for but that's literally all we have and every NFS title with wheel support is probably even worse than this  In the end if your game is going to have wheel support why even bother having it in the game if you're not gonna do it right?
168231015,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 is a fairly good game but it's just a matter of time until ubisoft decides to pull the plug on this one, just like they did with the original Crew, If buying is not owning then piracy is not stealing."
103655459,english,0,646910,"This game is max quantity, zero quality. If you told me this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies, it would all make sense. Then they added rpg elements with rng based loot. This is a parody of a driving game through the lens of the onion.  For example: this has time trial races with tiered time targets: easy, normal and hard. Let's say your brain is broken like me and you accept the challenge to 100% this game and learn the absurd and downright comical driving model which induces even hypercars to lift their inside rear tyre like a civic on hard turn in. Lets say you can easily beat the hard time with a stock car. You still gotta run the race 2 more times to complete it to get rewards. Every stupid race has to be done thee times. Every. Single. Event. This is just one among numerous issues.  Every single thing other than car customization is the commitee voting for the worst possible option every single time. Its like if twitch plays racing game development with assholes. Just don't buy this microtransaction hell. Even if this goes free to play. Don't be me."
115958990,english,1,646910,"OK.  I'm going to write this as someone who has been a huge fan of The Crew franchise.  The short answer is, ""Yes.  I'd recommend this game.""  The longer answer is a little more nuanced and if you'd like to read a few ""caveats"" from someone who still enjoys the game, mostly......please proceed.  I have played this game since launch.  I owned the ""Gold Edition"" on PS4 and logged A LOT of hours there.  I then made the switch to PC and, as you can see, I've logged over 200 more hours on here.  There are a lot of positives that any number of other reviews will also bring up.  There are also a lot of negatives, many of which are not immediately apparent.  And here is where I am going to bring these up.  They weren't severe enough for me to not recommend the game, but they were important enough for me to mention.  1.  No cross-platform support or cross-play (not too concerned about cross-play though)  It's one thing to not offer this.  It's another to have very specific rewards for completing certain events and not allow people who earned those rewards to carry them over (or even allow them to use MTX to buy them back on your new platform).  Don't get me wrong, if they asked me to pay money for items I already earned; I'd tell them to get bent.  However, this business model here actively discourages people from buying the game on more than one platform.  Seems stupid.  I have numerous cars earned from PS4 Summit, but because my Uplay account is logged in to a steam version of the game instead of a PS4 version of the game......I can't use them.  2.  It's pitched as ""any vehicle, anywhere, any time""  No.  It's not.  Sure, there are plenty of events and lots of different vehicles, but the lion's share of events and vehicles fall in to ""street race"".  There are more ""street race"" events than all the other ""Street HQ"" events combined.  There are more hypercars and street race cars than any other class except for MAYBE Rally Raid and Touring Car.  I don't mind these events/vehicles, but it would be nice to get something else.  It's especially bad for Summit as most ""special vehicle rewards"" are just another street spec or hypercar spec.  The ""Xtreme Series"" (one of the more unique aspects of the game) has less than ten events and that's after they added some.  3.  It's ""grindy"".  Again, clearly I don't mind the grind, but I'd be lying if I said a large majority of my time spent wasn't re-running the same handful of events for cash and parts.  The RNG is hell sometimes and certain vehicle types just get aggravating to get parts for.    For example.  I own full legendary part sets on every single hypercar I own.  I managed to do this in about a week simply re-running the New York hypercar event,  It nets about 300,000 bucks on Ace and yields a BUNCH of legendary parts.  The event is a long cross-country event and takes around 30 min to complete.  Simple enough.  Jump on, run it once or twice, net cash and parts.  But outside hypercars (and one or two street race events) there aren't any events like this for the other specs.  This is ESPECIALLY egregious, because they had stuff like that in the first Crew.  It would be nice if there was a better way of earning legendary sets without relying on Summit or getting to Icon 1000+ to dump a bunch of points in to buffing your loot quality and amount.    4.  ""Vanity Parts"" and ""Premium Currency""  I have an issue with ""pay to customize"", especially on a game where customizing is a key component to that experience.  It's one thing to pay $5 to have a gold gimp suit or some such crap on Battlefield or CoD.  It's another to have these ""pay parts"" on a game all about customizing.  It's made worse by the ""Season Passes"" having a ""regular"" and a ""premium"" version and even the premium pass doesn't net you enough Crew Credits to buy an epic vanity part.  You get a couple extra vehicles (probably another street spec or hypercar).  I mostly bring this up because they used to gift Crew Credits a bunch more and just by saving up a bit, you could put them to use in amazing ways and made you WANT to play.  5.  The ""Online"" Experience.  It's not great.  It's better than a lot I've seen, but it's still pretty bad.  I've had invites from all kinds of people,  almost none that actually want to do events.  You join someone's crew, you screw around on the map until someone gets bored.  Someone joins YOUR crew, they quit as soon as they realize you're starting an event.  Maybe it's time.  Maybe it's the platform.  I can't say for sure.  I CAN say, the social experience WAS better when I was on PS4.  Last but not least, this isn't Forza.  If you're expecting Forza, then buy Forza.  This is more akin to the GOOD Need for Speeds from back in the day (i.e. Most Wanted, Carbon, Underground).  The physics aren't great, but they aren't horrible.  It's mostly just designed to goof off with and have a good time......not recreating what driving a Bugatti is like.  If nothing I said dissuaded you, then give it a try.....and if you see me around, shoot me an invite.  Just don't be afraid of doing something."

Someone without dogshat taste in music is possibly still trapped at Ubisoft. We need to do all we can to rescue this person from their descent to french hell.   Which is a lot like normal hell but much more bougie & smelly."
140621252,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is an open world arcade racing game with the map being the literal entire USA, downscaled to videogame size obviously. Also, i'm hyped for Motorfest even though i'll have to wait another year because Ubisoft, once again, decided to go to Epic Games. They already did come back crawling because Epic didn't work as good as they thought and yet here we are looking at them doing the exact same mistake again missing out on tons of sales because of the selling platform ONLY. Anyways.  I have done every single peace of Content this game has to offer, from races to photo ops but ""skills"" too and i can tell you i hated almost everything about this game; special hate goes out to every single Boat and Plane activity. I loved playing it, i mean it made me play for 200h+ but i will not ignore how bad of a videogame it actually is  People complain about the Crew 2 but i think its for the wrong reasons; most of the critism is about the grindy aspect of this game and yes they are right it indeed is one of the grindiest racing games ever but to be absolutely honest.. i bought a racing game to win races, if the grind is based on racing then why would i complain? anyways, theres seemingly endless content to be played, most of it feels either the same or really really alike but i really appreciate the cheer amount of content Ivory Tower came up with, set peaces and special events really look and feel cool to go through but it is obvious that most of it were simple instagram filters being put onto your screen to make it feel different even if it mostly isn't.  Graphics are OKAY, it does look outdated compared to even older titles and the antialasing is basically non existent, the backmirrors do not work and your headlights are literally looking like transparent yellow JPGs to make it look like there was light but it actually is no light source at all inside the game engine, the steering wheel barely moves at higher speeds. It definetily has its moments though, it can look pretty and sometimes i had more NFS Underground Vibes than the past 5 Need for Speeds were able to get me but the fact the night time got literally massacred in order to cover up non functioning headlights really bothers me  Heres what i think is important to know before getting into it Anything you do, wether it be menu navigation or real time gameplay, it feels like a mobile game with PC features. Theres so many decisions made in design which simply go all against the user experience to make it as annyoing and uncomfortable as possible and i will have to give you a couple examples to make some sense of what i actually mean:   Every time you finish a race theres an unskippable animation playing telling you that you won, how much XP you got and how much money you earned, it takes almost 10 seconds every single time, right after that you'll see some funny colorfull packages spawning in front of your car so you collect them, these are literally random generated tuning parts which also have (feelingly) hundreds of additional passive effects besides pushing the cars perfomance. Once your inventory is full and you tuned up your car, you gotta dismantle the stuff you don't need and that.. takes way too much time. I could guess that 1/3 of my playtime was dismantling tuning parts only. This entire process is what you get for playing the game. The Tuning is based on RPG NUMBERS and STATS, its no new super duper new engine you build into your car, its literally the same thing now being purple instead of blue (rarity=quality) and the number goes up from 245 to 247.  Other than that the Visual Freedom of your car is astonishingly huge, less for the GT and Hyper Classes but more than ever in street race cars, generally the car selection is almost as impressive as Forzas is.  The AI in your races also base their difficulty on those RPG like ""Perfomance Numbers"", meaning your car has to have a ""220-Stat"" to be able to compete in that specific race; this system leads to the AI being either entirely broken or not existent at all. One side of the game makes you want to own as many cars and have as much variety as possible, on the other side theres really obvious differences in cars in same classes. Almost every Muscle Car feels underpowered as hell while other ""meta-cars"" will have no problems whatsoever; Some cars really do struggle a ton to keep up with the AI, others will make you simply drive the course to the finish line making it a personal time trial.  But wait! theres more! The Crew 2 has an RPG like Skill Tree. It enhanced passive things like ""slipstream power"", range, effectiveness, it enhanced your nitrous in 7 different ways and makes competing against other lower level people a joke; actually the PVP section of this game is dead since release because of the slipstream mechanic which is absolute BS, you can literally hear your car gaining +100HP as you drive behind your mate. This is a racing game, no MMORPG and most certainly no MOBA, i genuinenly do not understand how one could implement such things into a racing game, making a skill set almost obsolete (of course you still have to know how to drive lol)  Also, there is an ingame real-money shop for you to buy cosmetics, car bundles and battle pass though you can buy the battle pass with ingame money you get from playing  On the plus side though, i really like how easy accessable the multiplayer is. You invite your friend to the party, you choose a race and there you go, no overcomplicated crap needed for this.  I love playing this game but i seriously hate everything that comes with it. In sale for less than 15 bucks, its a good deal for the amount of content you get."
57370276,english,1,646910,"If you've played the first game, then there is some returning stuff that you're already familiar with. The big-ass map, the various racing categories, [b]the grinding[/b], the fact that you'll most likely never own all the vehicles.  Pros: - Planes and boats are fun, the quick vehicle swap function too. - The loot system has been improved (unless you really liked to grind for hours for each car individually). Parts can be exchanged within the category, meaning that you'll get new parts based on the highest parts you own, for any vehicle of the same category. You can buy a brand new, vanilla car, and just install maxxed out parts you already own. - Live Summit events are good.  Mids: - The ""you own one car and can outfit it for several categories"" system got scrapped. You just own a car for a specific category. Maybe it's also available in a different category, maybe it's not. - The ""story"" and most characters. At this point, they should just give up the narrative part. Nobody cares, and it's not very interesting. The issue is that it's an arcade game whose very scope makes it hard to explain stuff (you're not going to be surprised by an NFS game being about illegal street racing, but how do you justify the plethora of vehicles available in the Crew? Well... maybe you shouldn't.)  Cons: - Hiro and most in-race announcers and commentary. Gets old reeeaaaal fast. - Just like in the Crew 1, the driving experience can rank from pleasant to extremely frustrating and clunky. - Can take a while to get into a PvP race due to the player population and the waiting system sucks (being able to join ""on-call"" à la GTAO would be great). - Having to actually go into HQs or your house and walk around to perform actions. Who's got time for that? Why can't I just do it from the menus? - Speaking of the menus... Pointless animations, loading times... And the submenu for the radio that also contains race-related options. That shit is whack.  So, is this a transcending experience? Nah. But it can be fun. Get it if you liked the first one, or if you wanna play with friends.  1) Stay away [u]2) Recommended when on sale or for a specific audience[/u] 3) Recommended 4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must play"
43232418,english,0,646910,"So much AI Rubberbanding it's not even funny, Cringeworthy dialogue, Poor vehicle handling, Microtransactions. Wait for Forza Horizon 4."
43416459,english,0,646910,"If you want to buy this because you think it improved from The Crew 1 keep your money. I couldnt even get a refund even though Iv explained to support how cheap this game is. They used the more than 2 hours of play excuse, I had 4 at the time and thats counting all the cinematics, you basically cant see how cheap it is before passing the 2 hours mark. Keep your money."
54748485,english,1,646910,"After 50 hours, The Crew 2 has left me with a lot of wonderful memories. They aren't filled with the kind of emergent stories you get from exploring an open world and its systems, nor are they moments that involve goofing around with strangers--The Crew 2 is lacking in both those aspects. Instead, my memories are filled with the game's variety of vehicular activities and the wonderfully curated tracks: the unrealistic, the impossible, and the delightful.  It's surprising to see just how much The Crew 2 differs from the original game. There's been a noticeable shift in Ubisoft’s last few open-world titles, one that's moving toward a focus on player-driven progression--large selections of optional activities, non-linear structures, rewards for doing just about anything--and The Crew 2 benefits significantly from this direction. The gritty crime angle from the original game is gone, and instead, The Crew 2 takes reams of pages from the book of Forza Horizon. The game centers on a nationwide festival of motorsports where you, a rookie, are poised to become the next big star. While the setup is conventional, and the focus on social media fame is obnoxious, what it brings to the game is a colorful and upbeat vibe, an impressive variety of different disciplines, and positively ridiculous arcade driving on land, water, and through the air.  Despite the game's focus on real-world branding and mimicry of televised motorsports, The Crew 2's greatest asset is its willingness to be ridiculous. Races in The Crew 2 might involve jumping your street-racing car off skyscrapers, or your powerboat off the Hoover Dam. They might include making high-speed touring cars go head to head through the tight, windy Hollywood Hills, and motocross bikes take jumps across shipping freighters and freeways right before you transform into a prop plane like some kind of extreme-sports mecha. This is a game that will cover Los Angeles in three feet of snow for no logical reason other than icy roads make for more thrilling street races. Abundant nitro boosts, uncomplicated drifting, and generous rubber-banding also help keep the act of driving exciting when things are relatively tame.  As a game with an open world, races and challenges can naturally be found and initiated when you stumble across them at particular points on the map. However, playing The Crew 2 with open-world exploration as your primary means of moving from activity to activity reveals the game's major downfall: it's too big, and all the activities and interesting locations are too spread out. The game hides a number of boxes with vehicle components across the map, which you can hunt for using a proximity tracker, but even these feel too few and far between.  But with that in mind, The Crew 2 thankfully makes it easy to cut your commute down via player-friendly shortcuts. The game has an option to view all 120+ primary activities and countless more skill challenges (featuring things like escapes, slaloms, and a rewarding photo mode) in a categorized, list-style view, with the option to not just set a waypoint to them, but instantly start them no matter where you are in the world, at no cost. The loading times in The Crew 2 are impressively brief all around, so if you want to, you can churn through races and challenges back-to-back to very quickly and efficiently rack up progression points, earn cash, and set leaderboard positions from the moment you start.  It's an option that's both convenient and gives the impression that the game is conscious of your time. Likewise, any activity can be restarted or aborted in seconds if you're having a bad run, and there's a quick back-on-track feature that can be used any time. When you're not in an event you can switch to any vehicle you own immediately, without penalty, and without having to go anywhere. That's on top of being able to assign a favorite ground vehicle, boat, and plane to your right analog stick to allow for instantaneous switching during free-roam exploration, which provides its own kind of fun, for example, flying into the stratosphere with your plane before switching to a boat and careening back to Earth. Any vehicle that's available for sale is also graciously available for you to test drive on a moment's notice.  The variety of different vehicular disciplines in The Crew 2 is downright impressive--each of the 14 styles is tangibly unique from one another. Every time I started to get fatigued with one method of competition, I could quickly jump to another that had a completely different feel. Each is housed within one of four ""Families"" which you're free to move between to perpetuate your overall progress: Street (street racing, drifting, drag racing, long-distance hypercar racing), Offroad (cross-country rally raid, motocross, loose-surface rallycross), Freestyle (plane aerobatics, jet sprint boating, monster trucking), and Pro (power boating, air racing, touring cars, and grand prix).  While the execution of The Crew 2's disciplines might not wholly satisfy purists of any one given style, it does a great job of making each feel accessible, fun, and unique. I'm usually too intimidated by grand prix racing to give it a shot in other games, and I would never have even considered the idea of playing a power boating game. But, the Crew 2 encourages you to try a little bit of everything, and it's easy thanks to the game's approachable arcade-style mechanics, as well as the prospects of seeing more beautiful and ludicrous tracks.  And whether you're driving, boating, or flying across The Crew 2's America, it's a mostly beautiful journey. The game's natural environments, particularly bodies of water and the sky, look fantastic, as do weather effects like snow and rain. All are enhanced to breathtaking heights by the superb lighting, though the continuous day/night and weather cycle can be an occasional inconvenience during some events--whether it be afternoon sun in your eyes, snow obscuring track obstacles, or having to fly through a tight canyon in complete darkness. Where the visuals visibly falter are in dense urban areas. You likely won't notice buildings when you're zooming past them at 200km/h, but any slower and you can't help but notice how plain they are, especially in broad daylight with clear skies. Character models, on the other hand, always look incredibly basic, no matter the situation.  The game's RPG-style vehicle upgrade system returns from the original game, though it still doesn't feel particularly meaningful. You'll receive loot after every race in various stages of rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic), and each corresponds to a particular vehicle part and has its own power number, which contributes to your vehicle's overall power number. There is some small benefit to this system--all vehicles of a particular class, despite having different power levels in their stock configuration, will max out at the same number, meaning you can stick with your favorite car all the way up to and through the endgame.  I'm annoyed by the game's lack of public interaction and meaningless gear system, but I'll fondly recall both the tension of flinging sprint boats back and forth through the narrow, artificial canals of The Venetian in Las Vegas, and the easygoing satisfaction of an hour-long hypercar race from New York to San Francisco, where I listened to a podcast and enjoyed the rolling scenery. Despite its shortcomings, The Crew 2 still displays admirable strengths, which lie in its player-friendly features, freedom of movement, and its willingness to bend the rules in order to make things exciting and varied for an accessible, American-themed thrillride."
43896580,english,1,646910,"✓ 150 Hours ✓ Completed 100% of the game content ✓ Completed 100% of the achievements  Here is a rundown of Pros and Cons, with explanations, along with a score breakdown and final conclusion.  Pros:      • Captivating           -With each race comes different tracks, different skips, and different means of completing. With a percentage displaying the completion of a discipline (style of race) and an online competitive track time it’s very easy to get stuck into this game. Though a track can be completed it can always be done better, this factor is what drives the racers to become faster and better.      • Updated Often      • Good portrayal           -The game does an accurate portrayal of each discipline. Whether one loves Street Racing, Off-Roading, Free-Styling, or Pro-Racing, The Crew 2 provides just what one’d believe this discipline would be like.      • Tuning           -With tuning, and even pro-tuning, each vehicle may be adjusted to preferred likings. Tuning can make or break, quite literally, a vehicle. These tuning options can add Top Speed, Power, 0-60, Quarter Mile, and more.       • Great for a completionist           -The Crew 2 is not easy to complete, but it is easy to manage and observe the progress. Each discipline comes with a percentage of completion. In game, there is also an option to pin desired missions to track progress real time.   Cons:      • Poor story           -There is little to no story on this game. Your objective is to simply “become the champion”, which is done by just racing. The story focuses on being “follower famous” which is well, I guess a good portrayal of 2018.      • Awful commentary           -The commentary is quite laughable. Some lines do not make sense to even be mentioned, while others are just repeated.      • Inconsistency           -It’s somewhat of a hit or miss, funny pun, on which items are moveable. Some large trees are destructible while other small tables are not.      • Iffy graphics           -At times the graphics are phenomenal, at other times it’s feels like I’m back in 2007. The photo editor is very solid, but the in-game scenery is lacking.      • Poor reward           -Even when completing disciplines, there is hardly any reward. The only rewarding system is given after playing many hours and becoming the status of “Icon”.  -Scoring- Content 7/10 Graphics 5/10 Story Line 3/10 Score, 15/30, 5/10, 50%  -Conclusion- I purchased a racing game and I believe that’s what I got. Though the game is lacking in commentary and story, that’s not what I personally purchased it for. I purchased it to race, which is what this game excels at. The Crew 2 is a very entertaining racing game that will certainly give hours of enjoyment (as long as you don’t care about story line and such)."
91366795,english,1,646910,"Well well well!  It's 6 months now since i bought this one and i decided after 111 hours of gameplay to review it.  [h1]First the alternative titles i would give this game.[/h1]  Ford Focus hating simulator  Epic Car Wallpaper maker  Bugatti porn  The faster hatchbacks  The Crew 2 sponsored by Ford, Bugatti, Dodge and Chevrolet.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  The gameplay itself is really good, the tutorial (well it's a Ubisoft game there isn't much to expect) isn't well thought of in my opinion.  You start of with a vehicle the game gives you to finish your first mission.  After that you've been given a (rather small) selections of vehicles/cars for free.  The further you progress into the game the more options and challenges as well as vehicles get unlocked.  For the cars for example Ubisoft decided to help you progress by giving you a free Aston Martin Vanquish (which honestly helps a lot).  The game itself offers you various types of challenges and gamemodes so you never get bored.  When it comes to missions, i sadly have to mention that the npcs even on the higher difficulty seem to struggle sometimes. Weather conditions while in a mission are nice but could cost you your lead since it looks like the npcs don't struggle with it as you do.  More to that later on.  [h1] Design [/h1]  Even on a lower setting the design and graffics are good enough for amazing screenshots.  The cars are well detailed like the real life ones, you have a very simplified map and speedometer and the menus aren't in any way confusing.  The settings are nicely ordered which is consumer friendly.  [h1] The good things [/h1]  Amazing graphics with great detailing.  Good and constructive gameplay.  A good variety of vehicles to choose from.  A photo mode with a great variety of settings to make your perfect screenshots.  A huge and well detailed map of the US  A lot of missions and challenges to choose from.  [h1] The bad/salty things [/h1]  As stated earlier, weather conditions with bad traffic could easily ruin your race.  The Navigation responds very slow and bugged since the last update  The developers seem to gotten sponsored by the car manufactorers mentioned earlier because of the sheer amount of cars of each brand that are in the game.  Some car manufactorers that have produced amazing cars e.g. Toyota, Lancia, Skoda are completely left out which is sad to be honest.  The tutorial isn't really helpful when you haven't played the game before.  [h1] The confusing things [/h1]  For example, the aero of all the cars (even those with a huge rear spoiler) isn't considered even though the game tries to be really realistic  AWD(All-wheel-drive)-Cars like the BMW M8 behave like RWD(Rear-wheel-drive)-Cars, but FWD(Front-wheel-drive)-Cars behave like RWD-Cars with more traction  Some stats of the cars are confusing: VW Golf GTI 0 - 100 km/h   2.4 seconds HP: 550                                                               Bugatti Veyron 0 - 100km/h 2.6 seconds HP: about 1670  The weight of the cars aren't mentioned and most likely not even considered in the game.  So how could your regular Golf GTI with FWD be faster from 0 - 100km/h than a hypercar that costs irl like 3.5 million Euros?  [h1] My verdict [/h1]  It is a great game with a few twists but you can enjoy it in any way you like since it's an open-world game with many options and way to play it.  Do you like to just casually drive around?  You can just do it.  Or crash into the statue of liberty with a plane for fun?  Yeah go on.  The game won't force you to play it in a specific way.  So in short i recommend it if you like cars like i do.  Short notice: Please do not take this review all so seriously since it's my honest opinion on it."
43355631,english,0,646910,"UPDATE 7/13/2018: Just wanna' add in here that you will win most races, which I have been, you just have to grind parts for a couple of hours and keep your vehicle up to date or you will get smoked by the AI. Of course it's considered common sense I suppose, but it's also a bit repetitive as well. Nevertheless, I still think the mechanics of this game are ""Ridge Racer Type R4 bump the wall lose race"" type of sh*t. But it's not too, too bad. ____________________________________________________________  So far, after spending about 26 hours on the game, it seems like all you do is mindlessly race for better car parts against AI Jesus, and while that is of course the point of the game, in The Crew 1 it felt like there was more to it as you could venture off and visit landmarks all around the USA instead of racing, learning about known areas of the country while getting paid 2,000 bucks for each landmark you visit.... which seemed (imo) to cator to people who just like to drive around, and it also had PvP at the start. There seemed to be an actual story in The Crew 1 from what I recall also. Story in this game (TC2) feels like they went a TDU2 (Test Drive Unlimited 2) direction, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'll tell you what IS bad, mindlessly grinding against the ""holier than thou, on rails"" AI for car parts, requiring you to race damn near perfect. But I'll get to that here in a second don't you worry....  Also, what's the point of having a house or garage in this game if you can't even do sh*t with it yet? Can't customize it, can't have people over, can't do jack squatty. Seems like some azz backwards logic by the devs if you ask me.  I was also doing a Hypercar race heading towards Miami, paused the game, unpaused and suddenly there's snow everywhere down south and in Miami. Needs fixed asap. Funny thing is, I mentioned this when I sent a bug report during closed beta, guess they didn't get around to it yet? Idk.  In this game it's just the same sh*t over and over again, race after race against the computer with no variation in gameplay other than the fact you have planes and boats now. One big long azz grind to get better parts for your vehicles.... which don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with it, I quite enjoy it actually... or at least I WOULD F*CKING ENJOY IT BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE THE AI IN THIS GAME DRIVES LIKE IT'S ON RAILS!!!! YOU'RE A BEAST AND IN THE LEAD YOU SAY?? DOESN'T MATTER....IF YOU EVEN BRAKE A GODD*MN MILLISECOND FROM THE OPTIMAL SPOT ON A TURN, ALL 7 DRIVERS PASS YOUR AZZ UP!!!!! LIKE WHAT KIND OF BULLSH*T IS THAT??? COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE F*CKIN PURPOSE OF UPGRADING YOUR VEHICLES IF THE COMPUTER DRIVES AS IF JESUS CHRIST IS BEHIND THE WHEEL.......  *Sigh* Okay I feel better now. And with that being said, I love the game, but I think Ubisoft/ Ivory Tower can do a little better, c'mon now. Especially since these same devs are apparently responsible for TDU, which imo blows this out of the water minus the graphics. That's sad. I mean graphically, sound-wise, and car handling.... this game is a big improvement over TC1, with the nice addition of planes, boats, and whatever else bullsh*t they may have thrown in there.... it's all fine and dandy, but the game feels empty... I'm not sure why they released a half azz game. But I don't give a f*ck, fix the AI - The End"

[/td] [/tr] [/table]  [i] My impression of the game kept on changing at each progressing 5 hours interval. This review was framed after investing 30+ hours into the game and concluding the final rivalry races. The initial hours were so repulsive and full of meh impressions. But once you get a hold of a particular vehicle type and its handling, it’s all fun and excitement.[/i]  [h1][b] 📝Story/Plot:[/b][/h1] Just a generic plot setup to give your grind some motive and goal. A rookie entering the world of racing and guess what, some organizers see his potential and gave him a chance without even seeing him race beforehand. Just be #1 all around the events and conclude your journey after beating the top dogs who were the organizers too.  [h1][b]🎮Gameplay:[/b][/h1] [b]Initial impression-[/b] Imagine a hot girl with no personality. That’s the first 5-minute impression of The Crew 2. Starting off with high budget cinematics and performing short lap segment races while shifting to a new vehicle again and again. Sounds cool right? Wait until you see the whole f*cking world curve like in the movie Inception and Doctor Strange. At this point, my jaw was indisputably touching the ground. But just after completing a normal event race, it hit me with gloom and awkwardness. All that cinematic brag of “Speed is Life” and bla bla comes down to a slow race with the road looking like a low texture road. Like WTF?  [b]Mechanics/Controllability-[/b] I know it’s not a real sim racing game, nor advertised as a pure arcade. It’s unique on its own. But I feel like not giving it a category works as a bypass for some faulty mechanics. Cars feel slightly slow and weigh a ton on the controller. The purpose of a racing game is to acknowledge the speed atmosphere, which was only endured with top cars. Cars are not at all hard to control, rather easy and amusing. It’s the damn AI that makes all the races so tryhard. You are in lead for 97% of the race and suddenly an AI got a God’s hand and achieved supersonic speed. If you are thinking of bumping into them and play dirty, well have fun bumping a rubber band. All these aspects are blades of the same sword. AI feels difficult- what a tryhard game/Thank God it’s not cheap easy. Perspective matters here. I am not against it. Surely it’s sometimes annoying, but it iz what it iz.   It’s easy to understand how ground vehicles operate, steer, brake, drift, boost. But you are not familiar with aeroplane controls. Despite that, the first intro race makes you race an aeroplane. Instead of crossing checkpoints with my plane, I was crashing into enormous buildings and respawning. A terrible scenario that gets fixed in later event races where they teach you all aeroplane controls bit by bit.  [b]Open World-[/b] Take on the American motorsports scene as you explore across the entire USA. Being able to drive different vehicles like cars, bikes, boats and planes in the same open-world means not only you are free to drift your car on street roads, tread speedboat through the waterways but fly high across the sky too. Befitting pillars for the open-world statement. Now we know there are no restrictions, but what about interactables? Unfortunately, that’s a guessing game. Oh, I have a sharp turn incoming and I have to drift? Let’s do this then. You are halfway in your drift airmailing all those bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts in space, but suddenly you see a bench in between. That’s your stoppage. These randomly placed objects like benches or parked cars don’t follow Newton’s Law. They just wanna remain stationary no matter how hard you hit them. Trust me, these little objects ruined a lot of my lap times.  [b]Variety-[/b] You can use the astonishing top-notch live map, which single-handedly increases the game score by 2. Like how they even made it render the entire game in a 3D model just by a single click. Moving forward, the complete map contains various types of events/races you can take part in. Just for clarification, there are not AI vs races only. You can take part in a race against time, drifting, freestyling and a lot of car chases too. As I said, you are buying a complete package of the racing genre with multiple vehicle types. But there seems to be a hollow part of the story. During cinematics, you can easily see the top-quality work put together and the exciting race descriptions they narrate. But in reality, you won’t find those races in action. One cinematic had an image of a monster truck jumping out of a plane with a parachute, but there’s nothing present like that. They escalated the expectations through cinematic dialogues but disappointed us in the end. It’s not completely devastating as the default variety is already more than enough.  [b]PvP/Grinding-[/b] Sadly, you can’t run away from the “Look, there’s a level 1 guy with lvl99 car” scenario. It’s Ubisoft, which means expect a lot of transactions. Buy bundles, buy a season pass (Motorpass), or add in-game currency and get any high-speed car you want, but if you don’t wanna spend a penny, good luck grinding your a*s out. Be a part of a crew and evade the boredom of grinding alone.  [h1][b]📷Graphics:[/b][/h1] Enjoy a pizza full of delicious and uplifting toppings added on a half-cooked bread base. Now all your bites will have a random taste. Some will please your tastebuds, and some will taste like cardboard. The object detailing in the open world is great, but their textures, Oh Lord. Never expected to witness those low texture brick buildings from a 2018 game. Like, come on; all the vehicles, roadside objects, even dirt tracks look so good. Then why the buildings and gravel roads look like a dusty mirror. To avoid these bad graphic races, I played air and water races the most.  [h1][b]📝Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]  [b]Pros-[/b] [list]     [*]Big Open-world.     [*]Character and vehicle customization.     [*]Good chunk of playable time.      [*]Multiple vehicle types.     [*]Varied races and challenges.     [*]Offline or Online races. [/list]  [b]Cons-[/b] [list]     [*]Grind vs PayToWin is real.     [*]Semi cooked graphics.     [*]Annoying indestructible objects.     [*]No dynamic weather in the open world. [/list]  [h1][b]🏷️Tips to new players:[/b][/h1] Keep in mind, you can drift your plane. Without this, you are going to kiss the land whenever you take a flight. Don’t start PvP races until you reach at least the Famous rank. There are no restrictions on which racetrack to follow. So cut the track however you want. The first one to cross the checkpoint is the winner. Change resolution to borderless. Otherwise, whenever you will Alt+Tab, the game will start re-syncing, which wastes 4-10 seconds of your life every time.  [h1][b]😇Honest Rating:[/b][/h1] If you are looking for that NFS arcade or real sim racing like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, then just buy them instead. It’s nowhere perfect or overly marvellous. But I can assure you, if you invest enough hours into the game, you will adore it even as toxic relation. Only buy on big sale!  Rating: 8/10 Best world bending I ever saw."
88527600,english,1,646910,I played Forza Horizon (3 and 4) before playing The Crew 2 and it (the crew) disappointed me. Is more like an arcade game and for me is boring. I prefer Forza. I am not saying that is not a good game but I had higher expectations.
88608887,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is one of my all-time favorite racing games, mostly because of all the freedom the player has. I'm not like the average car fan, in racing games I usually like to see how crazy I can make a car look instead of customizing it as if it was a real world vehicle, and the crew 2 is the perfect game for players like me. The customization is amazing, there are dozens and dozens of different parts for each of the nearing 400 vehicles, including a livery creating system to make and share skins with the community. The Crew 2 also has a big variety of vehicles, including my favorite, the DMC DeLorean (though I hope sometime soon they'll add tesla vehicles to the game!). The map is also extremely large, with amazing graphics, especially lighting. The tracks/courses are fun and creative, although some can be annoying at times. Overall, I give The Crew 2 5 stars, and I would recommend the game to any racing fan."
164128496,english,0,646910,"Doesn't matter how good this game is if it just gets taken away from you whenever they decide they've taken enough money off of you. As a longtime player of The Crew games and a lover of The Crew 2, do not buy this game. Pirate this $hit instead. Ubisoft CEO said players should be ""comfortable with not owning"" their games. Start by not owning this one."
43749472,english,0,646910,"WARNING, DO NOT BUY DELUXE EDITION!!! I bought this game either launch day or the day after (Deluxe Edition) and here we are nearly a month later an I have not recieved either of the 2 vehicles in the Legendary Vehicles Pack, they were locked under ""Early Access"" and can now be purchased by everyone, problem is I have already paid an extra $20 dollars for them. Support is un-responsive and my issue has been ignored totally in the forums, so what did I end up with? I ended up with an $80 dollar base game. so BUYER BEWARE, get the regular version or the gold, deluxe is complete rip off."
81510860,english,0,646910,"In short, Great concept, ((STUPID)) expensive on top of also Micro-transactions GALORE!!!    In detail: The concept of this game is great! The map size (Friggin huge), multiple motorsports, and the amount of multiplayer potential is amazing! There is however a pretty BIG issue with the current way the game is going. Its following the same downward spiral a lot of other games are doing. ""premium currency"" and the so-called ""battlepass"" (Litterally worded as ""motorpass"" in this game.)   Now im not bashing on the battlepass idea entirely. if this game was free-to-play with DLC's i could understand...however this game costs a gross amount of money and it still feels like a ""free-to-play"" game. they have these ""Crew Credits"" (CC) that USED to be obtained via contracts. however now they are only obtained through this ""battlepass"" in order to be able to get EVERYTHING from the motorpass, it will cost ya 80k CC. You get 20k for free from the pass and an additional 20k if ya bought the premium motorpass. Furthermore most of the content of the game is locked behind this paywall. I'm sorry but if i pay $90 for a game, i wanna be able to play ALL of it. (Forza Horizon series did it right in my opinion.) Lots of cars to drive? yup but if ya want them all...gotta get through the paywall. Hey want a cool police lightbar? We got ya covered! Just spend 80k CC and grind your hind end off every day and maybe get almost to the END of the ""motorpass"" and you can have it right before ya get burnt out on the game!   Players are leaving the game because of this stuff and i feel like the devs are thinking ""Game is dying? welp time to milk every last dime out of the remaining players till it dies! Then we will work on ANOTHER game and when it dies, we will do it AGAIN!"" This isn't a game made truely for players, it a game made just for profit.  PS. Just bought some crew credits for my sis on her account with my card, Money is gone, Crew Credits not there. They are more than money monsters, they are scammers! Also, funny how i cant find a phone number for the ubisoft support. Guess ill have to have a conversation with a robot"
60802811,english,1,646910,"Let me get right to the point. I would not recommend this game if you're looking for a good racing game. I would not recommend this game if you are all about graphics. I would not recommend this game if you like any sort of story line.           I would recommend this game highly, higher than any other game if you're looking for something you can just listen to your chill playlist, cruise, and maybe even get boofed ;). I purchased this game last year (base game) for full price, I think I put maybe $10 into it after that to get a nice drift car, then I realized the games racing is shit.           So now I only play the game to go cruise the US and just relax and waste time. Nothing like coming home from work, heating up the rig and downing a glob, then just chilling driving around."
70528009,english,0,646910,"5/10 - Lots to like, but lots to hate. Could have been so much more. Full review below:  = Intro =  Sometimes, I'm in the mood for a racer. I fondly remember the days of NFSU 2, Gran Turismo on the PS and Most Wanted, games that not only lasted me weeks, but gave me new bands to listen to and endless replay value. Had this on my 'to play' list so got around to it. Enjoyed Forza, but it felt a bit flat and I wanted something with a bit more progression.  = Gameplay =  This is a racing game. Vrooom, cars go fast. But it's also a watersports game. And an offroad game. And a rally game. And a flying stunts game. And a flying racer game. And another dozen types of racing/stunt game rolled into one. Oh and also a loot game. You can see the problem immediately.  That said, man - this game does try. And sometimes gets it right. The water racing is immensely fun. Rally racing is great. Motorcross is mostly a blast. The absolute apex of the game for me are the lengthy 'runs' - massive races between cities, that lead you through towns, cities, mountains, forests etc. Glorious.  The weakest part of the game for me has to be the street racing, which isn't the nice, varied, speedy tracks you are likely expecting, but rather boxy, twisty monstrosities filled with right-angle turns. Right off the bat, these were frustrating as heck and some of the later ones will make you want to eat a kitten.  This has to do with the fact that a lot of cars handle like shopping carts and the more expensive ones handle like shopping carts with a jet booster. This game works best with long, open tracks, which sadly are lacking in a lot of styles.  Beyond this, every 'discipline' has it's own set of vehicles and loot. Welcome to the grind overdrive. And this is made worse by the fact that the sheer number of event types means that many only get a handful of races, total.  However the kicker is the AI. It...cheats. Rubberbanding is utterly crazy, especially when you start doing higher difficulty races - but unlike other games, it's only applied to give the AI an advantage. If you fail to drive perfectly on some tracks, the AI will soar past you instantly. Or it may just randomly do that anyway.  However once the AI is ahead, it just keeps on going. This is especially evident in the set-vehicle races where you and the AI have (allegedly) the same vehicles and specs. However, on Ace, you can enjoy the sight of the AI flying into the distance right from the get go, waving and flipping the bird.  This leads to a lot of styles being not only about driving prowess but luck, and finding ways to break the game. Weird, unmarked shortcuts, odd physics and the like. Sigh.  All of that said though, I don't hate this game. When it works, it works like gangbusters. Maybe if they had removed the boring flying stuff and produced double the races for existing styles, this could have been a winner.  = Graphics and Audio =  Visually, this game is a mixed bag. Water is lovely. Weather is beautiful. Lighting can be stunning. But textures are meh and ...wow, do cities look awful. Especially at daytime. Framerates are perfect.  Audio, rather than the mix of metal, rock, punk, rap and EDM you may be expecting is instead a small collection of the blandest EDM known to man.   = Style =  As I've said - too cluttered, too thinly spread.  And the interface/design is a nightmare. Let's say you do a race a few times, restarting immediately after you finish. Your loot goes to the mailbox. You then need to leave the race (loading time), go to a racing base (loading time), walk around, get the mail, exit the base (loading time), go to your home (loading time), walk up to your vehicle stand, change your vehicle (loading time) and then upgrade it.  Welcome to busywork.  But the absolute worst thing for me was discovering, after returning to the game after a long period, that there was no way to reset progress, whatsoever. Meaning if you experiment early and foul things up, there is no way to ever remedy it.  = Value =  To be fair, there is a lot here for the price, especially if you get this game on it's frequent, really good specials.  There are microtransactions, but most of the stuff can be earned in-game. However there is also stuff that can't. And I'm sick of microtransactions in AAA priced games.  = Overall =  + Many events are insanely fun + Original and well implemented loot system + 'Run' races are just awesome  - Impossible to ever reset progress/start a new game - Insanely cheaty AI - Frustrating street racing - Awful interface - Open world feels meaningless - Spread way too thin - Ubisoft style microtransactions  At the end of the day, this is a game I really want to like. With a bit more focus, less insane design decisions and some better/more interesting tracks, this could have been amazing. As it is...it's both enjoyable enough to keep me playing and flawed enough to make this hard to recommend."

135628343,english,1,646910,"[h1] This game is simply amazing! [/h1] The graphics are great. There is a [b] ton [/b] of content. Great progression too, you are always advancing, but little by little, making for interesting game play over time. It is definitely worth its standard 50$ price tag but I bought it when it was on sale for 10$.  Thank you for reading my review!"
180604033,english,1,646910,"Many people say that this game is bad, assuming that it is because of the horrible graphics you will always notice. Personally, this is one of the games that I would recommend to give some time to spend on because it is fun and the player has freedom to cruise around and do numerous activities whether you play by yourself or with a built crew.  With the ability to switch to another vehicle whether air or water while driving, you get to realize that there are so many things that this game offers. For me, this is an awesome game, though the sole issue I have with this game is that it is only playable ONLINE. I wish there is a feature where in you can drive around and participate in races even without the online feature or just disabled online mode. In addition to the free-roaming, there are races that provide the player a huge drop of cash and with the ability to increase the number of drop of car parts and money by progressing your ICON stats, you are guaranteed wealthy enough to purchase numerous vehicles of different disciplines that are so many that I am speechless of this game and how amazing it is.  To conclude. The Crew 2 is fun. Surely some will say the graphic renditions, especially buildings and environments have awful sight to it, but still, with all honesty, this is a fun game to play. If you purchased the Gold Edition, you will receive free, if I am not mistaken, 22 vehicles for free and few exclusive vehicles that you can get for free."
62437027,english,1,646910,"This game has received a lot of hate. Personally, I believe a lot of the hate it undeserved, but they can make some good points.  Starting with the pros: - Vehicle variety and detail. This game has over 300 different vehicles, and personally I believe the detail on the vehicles is out standing, even things as small as bolts for some extended fenders:   10/10  - Vehicle Customisation. Almost all of the vehicles have a wide range of changeable parts. There are many options to choose from in an easy to navigate menu, as well as bonus items that can be rewarded from playing the game by doing daily missions giving you a currency to buy special items such as under glow, custom wheels, tire smoke and more.         9/10  - The Map Size. The map size is where this game stands out above all. In a fast car (280Mph top speed+) with good driving it took me over an hour to travel from the southeast tip to the north west tip. In this map you will find several cities and other land marks along the way, also encountering the occasional player along your journey. The details in the cities are spectacular and the amount of places to go are countless.     10/10  - Multiplayer. The game puts you into a public lobby filled with usually around 3 to 8 other players, communicating with a custom chat menu which prevents and toxicity or bullying. When you want to play alone you can but on the other hand if you are looking to go on a road trip with a friend or do some races with a pal this game has made an easy system for you to do so.       8/10  - Race Variety. Currently in the game there and 16 different Motorsports events to choose from:       -Street Race, Drift, Drag race, Hyper car       -Motor cross, Hovercraft, Rally cross ( off-road ), Rally raid       -Freestyle ( Stunt planes), jet sprint ( Small boat racing ), demo derby, Monster truck       -Touring car, F1, Boat racing, Air race Along with these you get different skill based activities like Speed-traps and escapes ( furthest distance in a period of time ) as well as Photo ops of landmarks or player scenarios.          10/10  - The Summit. Every week, there is a series of events that you can do competing against other players in order to win prices such as followers, parts or occasionally, cars. This feature gives a deep purpose to this game, and for me a feeling like i need and want to come back to do those races and get those prizes. 10/10  Smaller mentions: -Unlimited garage space -Customisable car settings and parts -As you level up, you will receive rewards at certain milestones ( Cars planes boats etc )   And now the Cons:  -Graphics. This game can look beautiful, however a lot of the places feel empty or dull, like they need something extra. Also, the shading was poorly made, with a lot of colours looking flat. Like I said, certain places look fantastic and are very photogenic, however the textures aren't HD and could have more colour. With a simple graphics remake this game could easily be level with GTA V or FH4.     3.5/10  -Sound. Some of the car sounds are well executed, but for the most part they seem dull and like they could be more intense. The vehicles that do sound good are incredible, however a lot of cars that seem powerful get underwhelmed by the sounds coming from the engine.  4/10  -Weather. Now when i say weather I need to make it VERY clear i mean the weather changing, not the visuals. In my opinion, the rain in this game falls just short of GTA V rain puddles in the city at night, but with this game you can be in sunny weather, you go into settings to maybe turn your sound down a little and when you are out of the menu, boom: Thick snow. Even when it changes visibly to the player, it is too fast and too frequent. 5/10  -The Voices. Oh my lord turn off voices and turn on subtitles because the majority of the voices in this game are infuriating and get super annoying super quick.     1.5/10  -The prices. The vehicle prices can be realistic and occasionally generous, with a Buggati Chiron costing 2.4 million, but then when you venture over to the low end of the spectrum like bikes, you start to see prices like 500 grand for a sports bike. It isn't accurate. Another thing to mention is the grind for money. The money received after a race needs to increase, as grinding mindlessly for 3 hours in order to save up 2.4 million like I have done gets quite frustrating, and whilst it normally pays off, the pain you feel inside when you know the only way to get yourself that money you need for your next car is going to take 100 races of the same race is discomforting and off-putting.  Important note: i see a lot of people talking about rubber banding and i need to say i have never experienced this. I often finish races 10-30 seconds ahead when i use my super fast vehicles, and on other races like the 40 minute race it is often minutes ahead. If there was rubber banding, how could the times they are behind me be so large?  To summarise, I am saying this game is worth it, but keep it in your wishlist until it is on a sale to make up for the cons you may experience in this game.  Peace.    Side note to any active players: Anyone down to do some races together? DM me."
171979040,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2, a game where you can switch from driving a hypercar to piloting a plane faster than you can say ""Did I just clip that skyscraper?""  The game’s map is a condensed version of the USA, which means you can drive from New York to Los Angeles in about 30 minutes. Take that, real-world traffic!  Switching between vehicles is as simple as pressing a button. One moment you're cruising down the streets of Miami, and the next, you're free-falling from the sky because you accidentally transformed into a boat mid-air. Pro tip: boats don't fly.  The variety of races is vast, and so are the number of trees I've crashed into while attempting to pull off that ""totally planned"" drift. And let's not forget the photo mode challenges. Nothing says ""professional photographer"" like trying to snap a pic of a flamingo while barrel-rolling in a jet.  In conclusion, the game is pretty fun, sure the handling physics aren't anything like NFS of Forza, but the game has its charms."
174694396,english,0,646910,"[h1] Stop Destroying Videogames [/h1]  [b]  European Citizens' Initiative :  Video games have grown into an industry with billions of customers worth hundreds of billions of euros. During this time, a specific business practice in the industry has been slowly emerging that is not only an assault on basic consumer rights but is destroying the medium itself.  An increasing number of publishers are selling video games that are required to connect through the internet to the game publisher, or ""phone home"" to function. While this is not a problem in itself, when support ends for these types of games, very often publishers simply sever the connection necessary for the game to function, proceed to destroy all working copies of the game, and implement extensive measures to prevent the customer from repairing the game in any way.  This practice is effectively robbing customers of their purchases and makes restoration impossible. Besides being an affront on consumer rights, video games themselves are unique creative works. Like film, or music, one cannot be simply substituted with another. By destroying them, it represents a creative loss for everyone involved and erases history in ways not possible in other mediums.  Existing laws and consumer agencies are ill-prepared to protect customers against this practice. The ability for a company to destroy an item it has already sold to the customer long after the fact is not something that normally occurs in other industries. With license agreements required to simply run the game, many existing consumer protections are circumvented. This practice challenges the concept of ownership itself, where the customer is left with nothing after ""buying"" a game.     We wish to invoke Article 17 §1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [EUR-Lex - 12012P/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] – “No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss.” – This practice deprives European citizens of their property by making it so that they lose access to their product an indeterminate/arbitrary amount of time after the point of sale. We wish to see this remedied, at the core of this Initiative.   We also invoke Title XV of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)[EUR-Lex - 12012E/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] and the following TFEU Articles as our justification for and the Union’s imperative to respond to this initiative:  Article 169 – Per §1, the EU has an obligation “to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection…to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers”. We believe this practice infringes upon or requires correction to be commensurate with the EU’s obligation. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with videogames.    Article 12 – “Consumer protection requirements shall be taken into account in defining and implementing other Union policies and activities.” Given that this practice extends across Member States and beyond the EU, the Union’s actions regarding this practice ought to keep consumer protection in mind. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with video games.  Article 114, §3 – “The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection… Within their respective powers, the European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective” This practice undermines the high level of consumer protection that the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council takes as the basis of law in the Union, and their objectives of establishing and maintaining the functioning of an internal market as described in §1 of this Article, and Article 26 TFEU.[/b]  [h1] THE CREW 2 IS NEXT!

94458352,english,1,646910,"Easily one of the best arcade racing games out there. Most of the critics are by the people who either judged the game by playing just a couple of hours or those comparing it with other racing/driving games. Here's my take on its pros and cons:  PROS:  1. Map: Insanely huge map of the USA. Has almost all the visiting sites you can think of. It'd take you half an hour to drive from NY to San Francisco. You can never get bored of the map, period.  2. Car collection: Huge car collection from all the popular makes. They keep adding more every week and with every new update. Same with boats, planes, etc. You can actually buy like 98% of the cars without paying actual money. You might need some grinding though. 'New York' or the 'Uber dam' are good events to grind.  3. Car customization: You can customize almost everything from car color to tires, rims, wings, body kits, smokes, nitros, windows, even the underglows. There's also a good, active community that keeps adding custom liveries (skins/vinyls) which you can apply to your cars directly. And of course, there's a decent liverly editor too.  4. Race tracks: Challenging and fun race tracks. Some even have good shortcuts which you can master by driving repeatedly. You may try to break some of the world records.  5. Diversity: Various disciplines to choose from. You ever get bored from the street races, you can do boat race, jet race, air race, motorbike race, monster trucks, you name it. Although the game has good diversity, it's biased towards street races due to the number of events available in it compared to other disciplines. But then, if you're a street racing fan, that's what you want.  6. Regular content update: Really impressed with the 'Live Summit' weekly events with unique themes. You compete with other players to get the prizes. Prizes being special edition cars, tires, car parts, nitros, followers, etc.  CONS:  1. Graphics: Being a 2018 game, the graphics could've been better. You can't expect amazing graphics for such a giant map but the textures and reflections could still be better (as they're reused a lot). The lightings/weather system is good during the day with bright sunlight but it looks like a water painting when cloudy or rainy. The nights are okay at best.  2. Unbalanced AI: The AI in the game is somewhat unbalanced. I mean you can easily win street races or hypercars in Ace (highest difficulty) with a decent, well-upgraded car. Like a Buggati Divo or La Voiture Noire. But then you'll sweat to finish even the 'Easy' drag races without grinding.  3. Physics: Funny. If you're looking for a racing game with realistic or good physics, this isn't the one. They've surely made the car handling better with each update, but it still hurts to see a hypercar wobble at 400+ kmph with slight curves.  4. Optimization: I'm not sure how it scored 7/10 on GameDebate for optimization. I have a good GPU. Though it runs smooth most of the time, a crowded street race or a multiplayer with varied ping rates would cause immediate lags. Sometimes even kick players out. Even the processor and the GPU runs hotter during the gameplay as compared to other games of the same scale.  5. PvP: There's no customizability for PvP races. Also, the PvP player base is low and often results in a long waiting time.  If you're a racing freak who loves arcade and don't mind a bit of a funny physics, go get it. You won't regret. If you're into simulators and graphics, stay away. I've been a Forza fan myself (have a good amount of hours spent on the windows store version), but this game is still very fun in what it offers."

119911539,english,1,646910,"I ignored this game for many years because I thought every single event involved a mix of cars, boats, and flying. Oh no, I was very wrong.  Had a lot of fun with this one. I bought the base game on sale for 10 bucks. The season pass isn't necessary as it just adds more cars and a slight discount in the game store, but you don't need it, you just gotta play and earn stuff that way which to me is more fun.   I'm really glad there's actually characters and narratives that kept me interested. A lot of racing games are just go here, do the race, go to the next one, etc etc. But here the story, leveling up, loot and characters made it feel like I was aiming for a goal.   There's a TON of stuff to do. Street racing, hyper car racing, drag, drift, power boats, air races,  rallycross, hovercraft, motocross, touring, demolition derby, and MONSTER TRUCKS!!!! Those were my favorite. It's all arcadey feeling, so you can turn your car in mid air and stuff like that. There's also HUGE JUMPS which are so much fun. Plus there's loads of side activities like taking photos of landmarks, animals, stunts, etc, and escape missions, speed traps to name a few. Not to mention weekly events (called Live Summit) that have leaderboards and rewards are based on how many points you rack up against other players.   On top of all that there's these really cool movie like scenarios called Motorflix where you have to either do events for movies, or smash vehicles like youre in Burnout 3. AND there's treasure map type missions where you get clues and have to find the specific area and take a picture, which when all are completed you'll get a nice reward. All of it is completely optional. You don't have to do every single event in any section to progress. I jumped around a lot. When I got tired of races, I'd jump into some drag races, monster trucks, photo ops, live summit or the motorflix. Just whatever you wanna do.  Speaking of rewards, this game gives them out nicely. Not just cars either. You can get parts, cool visual stuff like neon underglows or colored tire smoke or nitro colors. It's basically a dopamine simulator.   Got all the achievements, completed the live extreme series and did over 70% of street racing, offroad, freestyle, and pro racing events. I also did all three seasons of motorflix and part of season six. There's still a ton of stuff left to do if I wanted as well.  The only stuff I didn't like was that since you can fast travel to any event, there isn't much reason to drive around the world. Kinda wish they would take a Forza Horizon approach and have billboards and fast travel boards scattered around to encourage this, but the way the whole game is set up is still really fun. I wish the game had more steam achievements too since there's so many things to do and unlock in game. Kinda surprised they had em in the first place considering it's a Ubisoft game. But the worst part is it's online all the time, which means when Ubi shuts down the servers the game will be dead, probably. So it's possible the game has an expiration date, unless they let people play it single player.   And let me point out that while the game is called The Crew 2, I basically played almost the entire game by myself. I joined a crew for a little bit and did some stuff, but then I guess I got kicked out but all of my progress was still there so no big deal."
173366642,english,0,646910,"I can't express how deeply unsatisfying the non-physics-based driving feels; it's worse than a cheap arcade motorcycle game. Furthermore, online required (see what happened to The Crew 1), terrible, LONG, extremely frequent cut-scenes, very poor UI decisions (I couldn't even figure out how to exit the game!), FPS and resolution limited, a mandatory anti-cheat driver, and mediocre graphics means that there are far better games out there. The only reason I can see to purchase this game is for its boat racing, but even then, it's boring, in my opinion.  I don't really understand the positive reviews given how terrible driving feels to be honest."
169260250,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 doesn't work on the Steam Deck because Ubisoft refuses to support it. They could flip a switch and allow Linux compatibility with the anti-cheat, they just don't want to.  Plus we now know that paying for this game does not equal owning the game. Ubisoft owns the game and they will take away your access whenever they feel like it, just like they did with the original.  They don't respect Steam Deck customers but that shouldn't be a surprise because they've shown through their actions that they don't respect any of their customers."
68680690,english,1,646910,"Put some music on, grab your favorite car, and just drive.  Edit: Forza Horizon 4 is now on steam, this game is still ok but Forza is WAY better at the same concept. don't buy this, buy Forza."
48440230,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 has got the potential for a good arcade racing game. Unfortunately it's not.   While the graphics look nice and the cars offer very good feedback, the whole setting sucks. The story makes you want to turn of your PC as soon as those ai smart asses, you have to team up with, start talking. Their constant advice makes you want to throw up, run away or punch them in the face. And they keep talking all the time.  Of course you're a rookie driving your way up to stardom by collecting followers. The dream of every six year old.  And of course your path to the top is riddled with obstacles. At least that's something Ubisoft really does well. Especially when this concept forces players to pay real money to overcome the hindrances.  Your main hindrance are cars because you ain't got none. Or should I say almost none. The standard version of The Crew 2 gives you a slow street car, a slow plane and a slow boat. At least this allows you to play some races.   You need to win races to gain followers. Ending games in first, second or third position also grants you upgrades for your vehicle.  Additionally you earn in-game money. In-game money is needed to buy new cars, planes or boats. And that's exactly where Ubisofts sales department steps in. In order to shorten the tedious task of endlessly driving races to win the money necessary to buy cars for different events or higher racing classes, you can simply buy in-game money with real money.   You can also buy the season pass which grants you two new cars every month for one year and an in-game discount when buying new cars. Of course the season pass costs real money.  You also need the best cars in order to compete with other players in multi-player mode. It will take you a lot of racing time winning the necessary in-game money to buy the cars needed to beat the competition. And you also need to upgrade the cars.  No matter what type of car you buy, you always receive the standard edition. So you need to drive races with this car to add upgrades.   There's a lot of work to get the cars you need. And Ubisoft made sure that there are many different vehicles you need.  - Street Race - Drift - Drag Race - Hyper Car - Rally Raid - Moto Cross - Rally Cross - Aerobatics - Jetsprint - Monster Truck - Powerboat - Touring Car - Air Race - Alpha GP  In order to stand a chance in multi-player mode you need to learn the tracks including all shortcuts. Thankfully the multi-player tracks are the same as the single-player races. This gives you the chance to train and memorize routes.  Contrary to The Crew 1 the USA is no longer the star of the game. Although graphics have improved, villages and cities look exchangeable. The unique atmosphere of Chicago, New York, San Francisco or Miami is no longer perceptible in The Crew 2. Even the countryside sometimes looks artificial. Not everywhere, but in some places.   At some locations it seems as if the developers didn't finish designing the landscape. There are areas where bushes and trees seem to be missing and hills are bald.  Free riding is no longer fun. That's because other cars drive closer together. The Crew 1 allowed you to race top speed in the middle of the highway passing cars on both sides. Try that in The Crew 2 and you will constantly crash.  You often find places where the game tells you to take a photo. You'll get an achievement once you took 40 photos in unique places. If you tell the game to mark the spot for the photo nothing is marked. You'll start searching but don't know where to go. There's no mark at all and neither navigation not mini-map can guide you. Then you take a photo and still have 40 photos left to take.  The same applies for extra upgrades. Extra upgrades are scattered all over the US. Once you move close to an upgrade your navigation system starts blinking and pinging. But if you search for the upgrade it's nowhere to be found. At least I can't find them. In 20 hours play time I found a single upgrade. It was a huge shining blue box on a field, twice as big as my car and it could not be missed. But whenever I search for them in a city they are nowhere to be found. Not sure if it's me but it's frustrating. I think it's bugged or again unfinished development.  I could continue listing disadvantages but I guess you get the idea. Steam only allows 8000 words per review and I had to shorten this one.  The Crew 2 is a mess and the games only purpose is to pull money out of your pockets. I assume Ubisoft forced the developers to design the game this way. Market target are kids and youngsters that are likely to pay for better cars. Make it colorful, rise their self-esteem by increasing their number of followers and make them feel important.  Is there something good? Yes.  The developers managed to make drifting very enjoyable and very well controllable, given you picked the right car. I found the Ford Mustang GT Fastback to offer fantastic drift control.  All cars feel different and every car behaves very unique. That's a point the developers really did well. Feedback from cars is great and you can really feel if you're driving a limousine, a muscle car or a beach buggy.  Pros: - beautiful graphics - many races - very good feedback from cars - all cars feel unique - driving in general is fun - very good car engine sounds - you can fine tune your cars in very many ways (if you find the settings) - all cars, boats and planes can be test driven (for one or two minutes) - some upgrades offer special bonuses - photo mode, including filters  Cons: - extremely annoying story and ai team partners - ...that keep talking annoying bullshit and treat you like a child - cities feel artificial and static even if they look beautiful - only random car upgrades - very buggy - even crashes sometimes - distant traffic very often vanishes if you move closer - feels unfinished - every race has an introduction where you have to drive to the start line and some idiot gives annoying advice or talks about other very infuriating nonsense - ...and it happens every time you re-start the race - tries hard to make you pay real money - the game even sells clothes for your avatar - vehicles are very expensive making it an endless grind to buy a hyper-car - limited fun - often hard to find players in multi-player although the game is not that old - multiplayer races are far less fun than in The Crew 1 - free ride is far less fun than in The Crew 1 and often very annoying - zoomed out map of USA is simply black and white and looks far worse than in The Crew 1 - cumbersome, annoying menu navigation - not a single good song on the in-game radio stations. Seriously - not one. Not even in classic. - emphasis on single-player - long start time - no cops - cars given to season pass owners can not be purchased by none season pass owners - even some T-Shirts for your avatar can only be bought by season pass owners - boat races are difficult because you loose a lot of speed when you jump over ramps while the ai somehow doesn't - rubber-band ai - annoying photo challenges - ...and a lot of annoying other challenges - the game does not grant you upgrades or money if you win in a higher difficulty but your car does not have the necessary upgrade class. Even if you actually did win! WTF?! - all player characters are ugly and can't be changed once you picked yours - you only get loot in races if you win - no reason to explore the map independently (unlike in The Crew 1) - drag races are still extremely boring - plane acrobatics are even more boring - monster trucks and hovercrafts are totally unnecessary - I couldn't figure out how to instantly switch between cars, planes and boats - I couldn't figure out how to join a crew"

112286236,english,0,646910,"Game is great, around 400+ vehicles in it, different modes, cheesy story, but a good one nonetheless.  Now, the negative review is about what is happening with Ubisoft - their launcher does not function properly, so they do not want to fix it for ""older operating systems"". So despite that the game runs great and smoothly, the launcher doesn't. Making new friends is impossible and inviting old ones to play with you together is impossible, too. Ubisoft needs to have a serious talk with their developer team:  https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/138532/createdxgifactory2-could-not-be-located-in-the-dynamic-link-library-dxgi-dll/41?page=3&lang=en-US  EDIT: October 2022:  https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/138532/createdxgifactory2-could-not-be-located-in-the-dynamic-link-library-dxgi-dll-windows-7-no-longer-supported/262?lang=en-US  Ubisoft broke their launcher ""Ubisoft Connect"" so their games will NOT launch on Windows 7, which is in their requirements.

68199299,english,0,646910,"If this game goes on sale for $15 and you have nothing else to play I could recommend this game. The sad part is, this is a good game. It's a lot of fun. But the reason I can't recommend it is because the PVP is completely fucked. The Live Summit is the only way to get exclusive vehicles, but good luck ranking high enough in the live summit to score one of those exclusive vehicles. If you check the leaderboards, its blatantly obvious that the top players (whom you have to compete against in order to win the exclusive rewards) are exploiting. You can literally watch their ghost use these exploits to achieve a higher score, meaning the only way for you to beat them and unlock exclusive vehicles is to take all the fun out of the game and use the exploit yourself. If you just want to play solo, or with friends, I can recommend this game because the driving is fun and the graphics are great. However as a fan of PVP and racing games, I can't recommend this game until the dev team decides to do something about all of the exploiting players that rule the leaderboards. They need to either remove the exploits and wipe the leaderboards, or make it so that you can unlock every vehicle in the game without participating in the live summits. Either fix the PVP, or give us a way to work around it and still enjoy the game."
160183351,english,1,646910,"This is better than Motofest. Screw you Ubisoft.

154144034,english,0,646910,"Games sold as Single Player titles should have offline capabilities. They should not have Always Online features. It is appalling how disconnected the companies are from their clientele.  As long as the product is sold and non-refundable, they are good. If the patch doesn't come out for the game that is being taken down just because Online features and upkeep of the servers are not feasible things for the company, it will clearly show there the interest lies.   People get it, keeping up with server payments and infrastructure is costly and doesn't get cheaper, but if you pull a license from paying customers just like that, I really hope people will take notice and never buy anything from them going forward.   I won't, and will do my best to advise everyone I can to steer clear from companies like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.   And I really do hope companies that feel that it's an okay thing to do to their customers will implode and close up shop. It would suck for talented people who work on good games, but they are not the ones that profit from their own creations.  Edit: If anything, it would be somewhat of a fun time to pirate games of the said company to enjoy them for free. And without the constant worry that the library I've spent money on will go AWOL because some asshole in a suit made a call. I'm more than happy to pay for games I play, but the sad reality we all worried about for about a decade and a half start to creep in - If it's not Physical, don't buy it. I'm sure there will be more and more precedents like this and the big companies will hide behind ""anti-piracy drm"" argument with their Always Online bullshit as well.

172145788,english,1,646910,"I honestly kind of expected this game to be horrible. But Once I finally got it working, it was a lot more enjoyable then I planned it to be.

177818626,english,1,646910,"I'd say this game is worth a try. There’s plenty of racing, though it’s kind of like the towers in Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry—you’re constantly grinding for something.  About that grind: collecting tuning parts (to get bonuses, you need to put together a full set of the same color and type) can be a hassle. Don’t expect to complete a set easily—you’ll likely be replaying the same race multiple times. There are around 200 races in total, each with three difficulty levels. I’ve cleared 88% of the main races and about 51% of the three other categories, and I’m nowhere near completing a full set on any car. But honestly, you don't need a full set. Once you max out your car’s power, you can just blow past the AI ​​opponents and enjoy the view.  And the views here are worth it. The game is gorgeous, and the scale is impressive. You truly feel like you’re driving across an entire country. The map might even be bigger than Euro Truck Simulator's, even with all the DLC. Each state has its own distinct look and vibe, and I loved the variety.  The one downside is that the game kind of forces you to try different modes. I wasn’t really into planes or Off-Road, though the boat races were surprisingly fun. Some modes just feel pointless, like Derby. It’s just cars bouncing around with no real destruction physics. And F1 racing doesn’t really fit either—the arcade physics don’t do it justice, and when you’re driving an F1 car off-road, it’s just weird.  At first, I hated Off-Road races and was ready to skip them. I tried MX, Aerobatics, and Touring Car instead, but that sense of “incomplete” pushed me to finish those 20 Off-Road races, unlock the boss, and complete all the achievements.  Overall, the game’s pretty easy—maybe too easy. To make it more challenging, you’d have to clear everything on the easiest difficulty first, and with a game this big, that can get tiring. I put in 30 hours and only got through half the game. I really enjoyed the hypercars, though; I’d be down for even more long races that last an hour or more. There’s something special about speeding down a wide-open highway, listening to music, and soaking up the graphics.  In short, there’s something for everyone here, so I’d say it’s worth a thumbs-up."

SUPER disappointed in this game. This isn't even worth $60 it's definitely a $20 game or less. Honestly a low effort trash money grab.  Ironically there was a warning at the beggining of the open beta menu, where it said that it was a beta and that it doesn't represent the full game, NOPE, that beta literally showed everything the full game had to offer.

176423165,english,1,646910,"Ubisoft is undeniably awful and I hold no love for them, but this ended up possibly being the best dollar I ever spent. I got it originally because the discount was just too much to pass up but didn't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as I have and will continue to do. This title made me realize I love racing games.   I don't know how deep any of the activities are compared to the competition in the genre but it's pure good fun. There's lots of variety in event types and tons of vehicles with impressive customization. The drawbacks are that the characters are insufferable, just about every line of dialog is cringe inducing and the voice acting is wretchedly bad — but fortunately none of that matters in a game like this. Maybe that's a plus if you can laugh at it, but for me skipping just about all of it is mandatory.   Just turn up the music and drive! Or fly! Or sail."
174581978,english,0,646910,"I decided to play this game rather than leave it in the steam library simply because Ubisoft decided to close the server of the crew 1 rather than proving a patch of allowing players to play offline.

There are too many I can criticise about this game: terrible car selection in the menu, terrible handling and driving feedback, lacking of vehicle trade or hiding, and the worst is demolition derby. However there are many good about this game as well: large map and beautiful landscape, nice weather system and the best is the diversity of vehicles. Overall this game deserves a thumb up, Ubisoft is not. Now I think it's time to bring Vivendi back and put some pressure to Ubi."
53422750,english,1,646910,"Given my opinions and thoughts on its predecessor, I never thought I would've liked The Crew 2, let alone recommend it. But here I am. It's not a 100% recommendation, the game sure does have its flaws but for the price I paid during this sale, it's well worth it and deserves praise. And considering how much this game tries to get as close as possible to its competitor Forza Horizon, a comparison between the two games is as natural as it is mandatory. Let's examine its strengths:  Map: it's HUGE. I really mean it. It's huge unlike any other map you have seen in any other racing game. Looking at Forza Horizon's maps makes them look like they're the size of an ant. And unlike in The Crew 1, I get a feeling of traveling in the middle of nowhere much less frequently. Environments are diverse and there is more attention to details. Many opportunities for offroad. It really gives you a sense of freedom when exploring. Big yes.  Loading times: ... loading times? Never heard of that. Seamlessly teleport around the map and change vehichles on the fly. No waiting.  Content: cars? Let's be honest, that's the main reason we play this game for, right? Not just street-legal cars, but also offroad trucks and buggies, rallycross cars, and hypercars. But we ain't got only that. We have boats, planes and hovercrafts at our disposal as well. Which of course are a nice addition, but we're most likely going to spend most of our time in our beloved 4-wheel vehichles (2 wheel if you're into bikes, we got that too). And the game's car park is vast enough as well. Forza by contrast only offers cars... but a much wider selection of them.  Map activities: unlike in The Crew 1, these are not mandatory to grind in order to upgrade your car (which can take a serious amount of time if you're extremely unlycky), but there is only a goal to beat. That's it.  Sound: they're pretty good. That's judging from the Alfa Romeo Giulia, which sounds exactly like its real life counterpart, so I assume other sounds should be faithful to what they're supposed to reproduce.  Car performance upgrades: it's not good but it's still a great improvement from the previous game. Anytime you complete an event, you're guaranteed to receive a car part that's better than those already installed in your cars. And all performance parts are shareable across all vehichles in the same category, without being bound to the specific vehichle you obtained them with. You can potentially use a single high leveled car to obtain performance parts to upgrade all other similar vehichles almost instantly. Still not as good as just buying them with your own money but I'm not complaining...  Soundtrack: I can't describe how much more enjoyable this is compared to The Crew 1. I can finally play more than the only one decent song in the entire songlist.  Story: glad they ditched the story element. The plot in The Crew 1 was poor to say the least and I'd much rather have a generic motorsport event as a context than that. Annnnd this is where it's clear that this game is trying to get close to Forza Horizon. Win, progress across the various rounds of said generic competition, become the champion.  Now, to the ""meh"" parts:  Graphics: they're all but impressive. In fact it looks quite like The Crew 1. Except it even goes backwards. I'd like to know who thought it would be a good idea not to enable users to switch TAA off. The result is that the game looks like it's being run on console, extremely blurry at 1080p, like it was rendered at a lower resolution. While it can be disabled in a settings file, it breaks effects that rely on it, such as reflections. But hey, at least it will look crisp. Overall geometry detail is also mediocre. Oh, and also forced 60 FPS cap. No contest compared to Forza.  AI and difficulty: I'm getting Mario Kart flashbacks.The rubberbanding is just insane. And the difficulty balance across the events is way off. You will see opponents in front of you slowing down to let you pass only to see the same opponents zoom at godlike speeds past you once you're in front. And instead, in the RAID events, the prerecorded ghost is easy to beat, letting me win with a comfortable 40 seconds gap on average using a car with the recommended performance rating for the event.  Physics: better than the previous entry. Cars are still going to be prone to drifting and handbrake will still be useless (sending your car into an almost full stop the moment you press it and steer afterwards) but the driving experience remains overall enjoyable once you get used to it. It just... doesn't feel as natural as Forza.  Disciplines: this games does so many things at once and as a results doesn't shine in anything in particular. But being it arcade-oriented and given what I paid for it, it's not too much of a downside. It still includes and offers way more variety compared to its competitors.  Always-online: as far as I can tell, there is not too much focus on the online element... so why force us to be connected at all times? Folks with unstable internet connections such as myself don't like this you know.  In conclusion: give it a try. Not at a full price, though, or you risk feeling severely disappointed. In fact, I'd much rather pay full price on Forza than this. But overall... it's fun."
43517564,english,0,646910,"Pros: 1. Various race types. Air/Land/Water all in one. 2. Good Car selections.  Cons: 1. Bad controls for cars. Yes, it is arcade, not supposed to be realistic, but I don't really think it should feel like your tires is not sticking to the road. 2. Confusing key mappings. It does not tell you the controls when you got thrown into your first race/demo. The pause menu is not ESC but F10. You cannot have completely separate key binding for vehicles and airplanes. 3. Graphics is all right but could be a lot better. But why there is still a 60-FPS frame limiter? 4. Not really better than The Crew 1, if not worse.  Final Thoughts: If you want to buy this mainly because of car racing, there are many more options better than this one. NFS series for arcade, Forza Horizon for semi-arcade, Assetto Corsa/Project Car 2/Forza Motorsport for simulation side.  P.S. Forza Horizon 4 is coming October, might as well just wait for that one."

136001664,english,1,646910,"[h1] Drive like you stole it! [/h1] The Crew 2 is an open-world racing game developed by Ivory Tower and published by Ubisoft. It was released in 2018 and is a sequel to the original The Crew game. The game allows players to explore a vast open-world recreation of the United States, race against other players online, and collect a variety of vehicles, including cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles.  [h2] Pros and cons [/h2] [table] [tr] [th] 🟩 Positives [/th] [th] 🟥 Negatives [/th] [/tr] [tr] 	[td] - Expansive open-world with a variety of environments to explore  - Impressive level of vehicle customisation  - Wide range of vehicles to collect, including rare and unique ones  - Well-designed vehicle models with realistic handling  - Weekly events and challenges provide a sense of progression and competition  - Impressive graphics and sound design 	[/td] 	[td] - Grindy nature of the game may be off-putting for some players  - Limited storyline and lack of compelling characters  - Some ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits  - Multiplayer PvP mode is limited to simple point-to-point races  - Some bugs and issues with the game, though most have been addressed through updates and patches. 	[/td] [/tr] [/table]	  [h2] Gameplay [/h2] The Crew 2's gameplay is enjoyable and immersive, with a strong emphasis on exploration and racing. The game's expansive open-world allows players to explore various environments, from bustling cities to scenic countryside landscapes. The game's attention to detail is impressive, with realistic handling of the different vehicles and a wide range of customisation options.  [h3] Events [/h3] The game's ""live summits"" events are weekly events where players can win vanity items or time-limited cars. However, some players may struggle to win the top prize without first obtaining cars and parts that give them an advantage. The game's multiplayer PvP mode is a simple race from point A to point B.  [h2] Vehicles [/h2] The game offers rare, unique vehicles not usually found in other racing games. The game's vehicle models are well-designed, and the level of customisation is impressive, allowing players to almost widebody every car. However, some of the game's ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits, which may be off-putting for some players.  [h2] Story [/h2] The game's story is minimal, with no clear protagonist or antagonist, and the game focuses more on exploration and racing than storytelling. However, the game's open-world and the various challenges and events provide a sense of progression.  [h2] Graphics and Sound [/h2] The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed vehicle models and environments that look and feel realistic. The game's sound design is also noteworthy, with diverse sound effects adding to the immersive experience.  [h2] Conclusion [/h2] Overall, The Crew 2 is an enjoyable and immersive racing game that offers a vast open-world, a wide range of vehicles, and various events to compete in. The game's attention to detail is impressive, and the vehicle models are well-designed with realistic handling. However, some players may find the game's grindy nature and lack of a compelling story mode to be a turnoff. Nevertheless, The Crew 2 is still a game worth playing for racing fans and those who enjoy exploring and customising their vehicles."
120846641,english,1,646910,"I tried this game when it was free for a weekend, and decided to buy it. It is a very relaxing racing game which I play after office hours.  Positives: - There is a lot of content, and not the usual boring and filler material. So many types of races, including destruction derby, bike races and boats will keep you busy. - It is easy to upgrade cars, you get a lot of materials to upgrade. Live Summit changes every week and provides good rewards so leveling up is easy. - This game has one of the best ways to display the map that I have seen in a racing game.  - On Normal level, it is an easy game, so I play the race on normal and win, then try it on hard (and win again most of the time).   Negatives:  - Ubisoft - In a lot of races, you race against a ghost and there are no other drivers. - Soundtrack is mediocre. Racing games like NFS and Forza have one of the best soundtracks, something you enjoy while driving, but not here. Very okish.  - Graphics are good, but at some places, houses look like boxes.  - Online component is dead.  I also find the plane controls pathetic, although I am not sure if others feel this too.  Overall, it is worth the money. Get the gold edition, so that you have a headstart with extra cars and content."

I have finished all of the achievements before writing this review.  Multiplayer arcade race game where you race others with cars, bikes, boats and planes with a full controller support. Characters and story are forgettable, the gameplay though is very fun. If you are looking for realism, this is not a place for you. No police, traffic light changes every 2 sec, no vehicle damage (just scratches), drag cars can reach the speed of almost 700kmh (434mph), if you put side exhaust you will still have rear one.  The game loads once, and you are ready to go! The fast restarts, smooth vehicle swap, travel to challenges etc. Amazing car details and they sound awesome (except motorcycles). Radio offers a variety of different stations so every person can find something for them to listen (and I did not know about it because of a lack of tutorial and guidance in this game). Nevertheless, the world feels empty and lacks some serious gameplay. There is almost no reason to explore the in-game world apart from taking photo opportunities. There are no collectables, few skill games and limitless highlights with top speed, high jump and long drift.   Lots of vehicles, various race types, decent co-op gameplay BUT no PvP. The Crew is all about the PvP and it is not here at launch. ""The Crew 2"" has many of the same cars but in different categories, so if you buy a car in a Street Race category, you can use it for that only compared to the first game.  You can but a Ford Mustang as a Street, Drift, Drag, Track and Monster Truck. And here comes the currency problem. I hate games with microtransactions, but at least here you can play without the urge to spend some real cash. Although the prices are ridiculously high, it is not that hard to grind it out. Performance parts will come as a loot for finishing a race (green, blue, epic and I think legendary will be added with later updates), and it will take a long time to max out a single car because you can get parts with lower performance than what you have. Rare and Epic parts will have 1 and 2 additional modifiers respectively and you can use it to boost your gameplay in many ways.  Car customisation is pretty good but it is limited to the Street Racers Family (Cars with yellow icon) and Monster Trucks. For other classes, you can only change their wheels! You can create your own livery or download one of the popular ones and at least this feature is for all of them.  The game leaves a huge levelling potential (up to 9999) but to be honest there is no reason to do so, because at 600 is your last car reward, and every 10 levels from that point are just epic loot.  Races may vary from short ones up to 40min long with a ""rubber-banding"" difficulty which can be brutal since you will drive at your limits and AI will sometimes push you around and frustrate the hell out of you.  What is a ""Rubber Banding""? - Pushes them towards you if you are far from them and lowers their speed if you are too far behind. So, if you are driving at your and car's limit, the AI (especially 2nd place) will go into hyperspeed to catch up with you. They are not that generous if you fall behind but the AI will still slow down.  Now, I want to speak of things that frustrated me the most - lack of tutorials and a car reset. The game lacks tutorial in some cases! There are so many questions and no clear explanation or indication on how to do some stuff: how to shift a drag car, where is the mailbox when to use two different modes of boats etc. The last one will be verbally explained by one of the characters but if you miss it...   Now, the car resets... It takes 2 FULL seconds to put it back on track and sometimes it will put you WAY back in the race and if you happened to make a mistake in a 40 min long race, you are royally screwed. I was 1st and one small mistake (because the game doesn't show you the raceway like it should) + reset made me the last place with a 10 sec gap to 7th place. I saved the run and finished first but I was at 30% of the race when that happened.  Although I would still recommend this game but not for a full price unless everything I have said above is fine for you. As they did with ""The Crew"" they will add more content in here and it will feel much better to play it but until then, wait for a sale.

43245527,english,1,646910,"I've seen a lot of mixed reviews, I recommend it although it isn't a perfect game.  Some people seem to complain about landmarks and graphics. I find the graphics are great, and i couldn't care less about landmarks.  The MOST important thing to keep in mind, this is an ARCADE STYLE racing game. Not a simulator. If you wanted hyper realism then look elsewhere.  - Great vehicle selection - Good controls - Extensive Customization (you can get lost in it for hours) - Reward vehicles from the previous game - Playing with friends - Larger map area - Larger selection of events to do - More content to come  Here are some flaws (some major)  - Voice acting is ridiculous. No adults speak like these do. - WHERES THE MULTIPLAYER RACES?! (I know, they said they come in December, but most of us bought the game for the MP experience) - Not enough physical damage to vehicles (they seem to have dropped the ""repair"" feature) - Transition from car to boat to plane could have been slightly smoother    Everyone has a different opinion on the game. I'm just being honest. In terms of what I expected out of the game, I got exactly what I wanted... minus the delayed PVP/Multiplayer Racing.  I recommend the game, as long as players remember this is an ARCADE STYLE racing game, and not a simulation."
72413284,english,0,646910,"TL;DR - Ok, it is not that I hate this game, but I just don't recommend it.  For what it is worth, I have fun playing, the customization is nice and the driving feels (for the most part) good. What I have the most issue with is the glitches, minor inconveniences to game breakers. At the time of posting this review, the game literally does not start despite my efforts to get it to do run beyond the title screen. There is also a rather large amount of questionable choices in regards to what you can just blow through and what will crash your vehicle. My last real complaint is the lack of police chases that were present in the first game, while it doesn't exactly fit the ""story,"" it would have been nice to have been included for more incentive to explore and drive around.  Fortunately there is a lot I do like about the game. The car selection is very nice and while I am not the biggest fan of the boat/plane additions, I could see some enjoying the features thoroughly. I also like the Summit activities, which once a week update and always give me something to come back to (while it may be just recycling races from the base game). I also never have felt a need to resort to microtransactions.   In conclusion, I do like this game, after all, there is a reason I have dumped 150+ hours into it, but if you are on the fence, I can only recommend it on a decent sale. Otherwise, Steam offers some NFS games now that may better suit what you may be looking for. Cool game, but a bit lackluster."
156581569,english,0,646910,Great game but don't feel like playing it anymore since I feel like nothing I do will matter as this game will shut down just like the first Crew title and I'll lose all progress.

94158049,english,1,646910,"What is this game like? A game with a huge world, with an abundant number of vehicles, you can explore not only land, but also air and water. The actions of the game take place in the United States of America, during the game you will have where to turn around, drift, drag, ring races, as well as races all over the map, there will be no borders in front of you. ... You can buy a car of any level, the first good car will not be long in coming. Farming money in the game happens pretty quickly, but it's no less interesting from it. The map shows major cities in the States, as well as their attractions. Simply stunning graphics, effects of water, mud, rain, sun, clouds. Also, during the game you will visit the winter season, the physics of the car will change quite noticeably, which cannot but rejoice. But there are also disadvantages, your car in the game is not titanium, a small tree, like in Forza, will not be able to knock down, when it collides with a stone, it will most likely not stop it, but throw it up. In this game, cars are more like jumpers. I think we will stop at this and will not continue talking about the shortcomings of this game, but talk about the interface and additional functions.  The game has a very simple and beautiful interface, the eye rejoices looking at the picture in the hall. Also, the game is equipped with a photo function, at any moment of movement you can stop the moment and become a real photographer. You will be able to publish your work on the official website of the game.  The game also has character customization, leveling up skills, making a model out of furniture to make everyone envy you.  In conclusion, I want to say that it is a very rich game, its advantages overlap all the disadvantages, many updates have been made to the game, as well as a battle pass, if you are not sure about buying the game, then look at its reviews on the Internet. Thanks for attention !"
43257197,english,0,646910,"Ok, gonna keep this short. Don't buy this game.  With Forza Horizon 4 just around the corner, I'd recommend waiting for that.  This game has a lot of cool ideas and neat features, but is flawed in two MAJOR ways.  1. No person that likes customizing cars wants to get their parts from random loot at the end of races. That's just cringeworthy.  2. The physics are god awful. Turning feels lazy, there is no sense of speed, everything seems to float like GTA IV, and a lot of the control is handled by assists that dont turn off. There ends up being no sense of skill involved in driving.  What the hell good is a racing game about building and racing cars, when the building is largely out of your control, and the driving is completely unsatisfying?   Also, as a nitpick, the game is capped at 60fps, and the car models are pretty damn poor compared to Forza. The lighting model in this game is awesome, thats about it."
108925094,english,1,646910,"If you like racing game, enormous map with all sorts of diversity, many cars with many customisation and regular new events, then this game is definitely for you. Be a fearless racer or just fun chill driver, this game offers me so many things."

How long do we have, maybe another 2 to 3 years for this game? Possibly even less because of your focus on the other game? I don't like modern Forza games, but at least they let you play their older games even without an online connection.

84255376,english,0,646910,"This game was once a haven, once a miracle. It was an actually good racing game in the modern era. A rarity. But then The Chase happened. Before The Chase released in November 2020, I played this game almost every single day. I no-lifed it, grinded out every event, car, part, you name it. It was my favorite game. Then The Chase came along and ruined everything. It removed the ways to get the secondary currency (Crew Credits) by doing Daily tasks. Instead, the only way to get this currency now? Pay REAL MONEY. They also added the ""Motorpass"" system which locks a ton of content behind a paywall. These mechanics are horrific and make the game feel like a F2P, but it's a paid game! Absolutely ridiculous. I, along with many players, stopped playing after The Chase released and permanently changed the game for the worse. I finally came back to it a few days ago just for the game to almost explode my GPU because the PC port of this game is absolutely atrocious for optimization and decided ""enough is enough. It's time to let go."" I will be uninstalling the game after posting this review, but before I do let me run down every reason why you should not play this game, or at least be very weary about doing so.  -Optimization. I have a very decent rig, and yet this game THROTTLES my computer. Not to mention the game constantly crashes, and sometimes will lock up your computer for upwards of 20 minutes by doing so. If you still want to play this game after reading this, PLEASE consider playing a console port instead. As I said, this game could very well cause damage to your computer if you don't take caution. The game almost caused my GPU to break before I uninstalled it.  -Monetization. As I said in the first part of this review, The Chase introduced very predatory microtransactions into the the game. They are not forced, but they lock a lot of content behind a paywall and try to bait you into buying it. Very scummy.  -Repetition/Bland single player experience. The single player experience gets very repetitive and boring. The game has a very obvious bias to Street Racer events. There are 50 different Street Race events in the game. For perspective, no other class in the game breaks 20 unique events. Most classes don't break *10*. The game advertises itself as having tons of different vehicles and event types, but really it only focuses on Street Race. This applies to updates too, as 90% of the new events and cars that get added are Street Race or Hypercar class. On top of all of this, the singleplayer ai is ridiculously easy. The ""Races"" are more or less time trials with ai. Do not expect a challenging and enthralling singleplayer experience.  -Lack of understanding between devs and players. The devs do NOT listen to the feedback of the players, they just do as they please. The community went up in flames after The Chase, but the devs issued one statement that boiled down to ""we don't care, keep whining"". They do not listen. They do not care. The playerbase means nothing to them besides a means to make money. Do not expect the devs to do the right thing.  -Lack of variety. For a game that advertises itself for being diverse and varied, it sure isn't. The basegame gave us some variety sure, but all the content updates add the most generic and boring cars possible. Not to mention that other vehicle types such as boats, planes, bikes, etc NEVER get new content. They might add a new bike once every few months, but you will never see new boats or planes or other vehicles. And yet they will add pointless reskins of existing cars that nobody asked for all day long... They very obviously only care about adding the most predictable and uninteresting vehicles possible, so don't let the promise of variety fool you. You could easily get a similar car list out of other franchises.  -Boring events. This goes back to the boring and repetitive nature of the game, but most of the events are very boring and uninteresting layouts. There's a few good ones, but most of the tracks are extremely simple and easy. Very few sharp turns or hairpins, no traffic in races, overly long and tedious, etc. The ai will not pose a threat, and the track layouts will bore you to death after you play for a while.  -Empty and bland map. Lots of copy/paste in the map, lots of stretches of empty road, lots of areas lacking detail and feeling soullessly void of life, lots of extremely condensed towns and cities, it just feels like a very cheap map and is actually a downgrade from The Crew's map. No joke, look it up on YouTube. They downgraded the map bewteen games and it shows. A lot.  I had positive things to say about this game some months back, but all of my good will and love for the game has evaporated. I will still list some of the good things this game does however, just to be fair.  -Livery Editor. It has a good livery editor. I made plenty of detailed skins in my time playing the game. It's not the best, but it's pretty good. You can easily make good stuff with it and it's fairly limitless.  -Decent physics. They aren't phenominal and they certainly have their bad moments, but overall the physics are pretty light and fun. Rallycross cars especially are fun to just take on some dirt roads and rip it up with.  -Playability. You can't blow through the entire game in a few days, it does keep you coming back to play more. Money rewards are fairly low to make you work for what you want. The issue being that it takes that to an extreme and ends up becoming a bit tedious and boring. It has enough to keep you coming back, but maybe a bit too much.  Would I reccomend this game? No. Not anymore. I would and have reccomended the game to many people and friends since it came out in 2018, but after the last few months of the game's life I cannot support it anymore. Things started falling off in Summer 2020, but The Chase in Nov 2020 sealed it's fate. No longer can I enjoy this game, or advise others to play it. If you *still* want to play it, please do not play the PC version. You will regret it. Buy a console port, like PS4 or Xbox. They are far more stable (but still have issues. I played on PS4 and still had the game crash). I would seriously advise you to save your money, or maybe watch the updates for a few months in hopes that the studio gets their act together and brings the game back to it's glory days of 2019. I hope this review helps at least one person understand that this game is not what it once was, and that their money is better spent elsewhere.  TLDR: The game used to be really good but from Summer 2020 until now it has gotten progressively worse to the point where it's no longer worth playing. Buy something else or wait a few months to see if they fix the game with update, but  don't hold your breath."

You can't play it anymore, and they need some good reputation at the moment.

43146875,english,0,646910,"PREFACE: If you're wondering why I already have this many hours even though the game just launched hours ago, it is because I purchased the Ultimate Edition, and was able to play 3 days early via Early Access. Also, I put in over 200 hours into the first game of the series on Xbox One, and put in about 20+ hours into Beta for this game. I skipped through everything I was able to do in the Beta, and grinded my way up to Icon, so that I felt I had enough experience to make this review.  GAMEPLAY: This is where this game shines. I thoroughly enjoy the driving in this game. I came into it expecting to hate the boats/airplanes, and thought about ignoring them altogether, but instead I fell in love with them. I refuse to fast travel (except for the parts that I completed in the Beta), but now I find myself boating and/or flying to almost every race. The most important mechanic is the driving, and that feels great. Every vehicle in the game appears to drive differently, and have a unique weight that gives a great feeling to driving.   One of the biggest complaints of the Beta was how you could grind the rails and not lose any speed whatsoever, but Ubi has seemed to fix that at this point. Being in a vehicle is fun in this game, and that is important, considering that this is a racing game. Rubberbanding is a huge issue though, and detracts from the races themselves. The first title thrived on cross-country races, but what's the point of a 40 minute race, if only the last minute is all that matters? This needs to be sorted out. It almost encourages you to sit behind first place and conserve your nitrous until the last second.  The thing that can make gameplay SO aggravating is the GPS. They completely removed the arrows that you used to be able to follow on top of the screen. Now all you get is the tiny GPS off to the bottom right corner of the screen, and sometimes it can be impossible to follow, especially at extremely fast speeds. Unfortunately, that is not the only problem with the GPS. Half the time it doesn't even work, and just gives you a straight line to the location, and you have no idea how to get where you are going, so opt to fly there.  STORY/CHARACTERS: There is no story. A lot of people thought the story from the first game was quite boring, but was this really the solution for that? The characters serve no purpose, and bring no attachment to who they are. Right now this game is a single-player grind fest. Also, I don't know who did the animations for the characters in the game, but it looks like they hired the BioWare B-Team that did Mass Effect Andromeda. It's bad.  MULTIPLAYER: It is nonexistent. You can hook up with friends and drive around, but that is the ONLY form of multiplayer in the game, besides leaderboards for races. The fact that this game launched without PvP is an insult to the consumer. How can a game possibly be sold as an MMO-lite racer with no PvP? Right now the grind is for nothing, and we have no solid launch date for PvP. If you are looking to do online races, then do not purchase this game yet.  VISUALS: This game is beautiful. But only certain aspects. They nailed the two most important parts of racers, and that is the cars and lighting. The cars look absolutely stunning, and is a huge leap in the right direction for the series, even more than the last game's Wild Run expansion. Ironically, I also noted lighting as looking good. And that's true.....partially. The god rays in this game are among the best I've seen in a vanilla game. The lighting of the sky always captures the mood, and is generally quite gorgeous. Where does the lighting fail? In the headlights. It is IMPOSSIBLE to see in the dark, unless you are in a lit city. The distance of your headlights is a problem the community has raised since the Alpha state, but nothing appears to have been fixed in that area.  The landscapes are quite pretty, but what ruins it are the popins. Yes I have a GTX 1060, but look at any review. This is a problem across all platforms, even for people with 1080 TIs. Ubi has addressed this, saying that it had something to do with the draw distance forced by allowing planes in the game, but in truth, this does nothing but prove that Ubi is acknowledging that their game is not fully optimized, even though it is now launch day. I think it's pretty unacceptable to have a 1080 TI not be able to handle the popins, even when at 1080p.  The water is gorgeous, and is one of the saving graces for the environment. One of the reasons I travel by boat so much in this game is because the water is pretty, unique, fun, and doesn't have all the foliage popins.   The worst part about the graphics in this game are the buildings. They look like Legos, like something out of a game that came in the previous decade. It's so weird having a game that looks so beautiful in some aspects, but absolutely abysmal in others.  AUDIO: The audio in this game has caused a bunch problems for me. The amount of bugs is crazy. Half the time you will hear a car coming up right behind you, only to look behind you and see no one. Also if you crash into objects in the world, there is a bug that repeats the crashing sound on end until you pause the game.   The voice acting is pretty unfortunate. A lot of voices didn't match their faces/animations, and it sounds like Ubi just picked up random people off the street, used a subpar mic, and gave them really bad and cheezy lines to say.  The cars do sound nice, and especially the backfiring of cars can be really satisfying.  The music within the game's radiostations are also much more satisfying than the original game's.  ECONOMY: This game's economy has been VERY inconsistent from the start. Many cars didn't match each other in terms of price, and although they have addressed this slightly, the problem still rings true.  So, is the game P2W? Yeah. It definitely is. Right now, you can purchase a 2nd form of currency, and buy any car you want. I'm not saying microtransactions are the worst thing in the world, but when they are taken further than just cosmetics, I tend to have a problem with it. Right now you can spend extra cash, and compete on the leaderboards with any car in the game from the get-go. Imagine if PvP was actually in this game? Ubi is practically encouraging players to spend money to get everything from the start, and discouraging them from actually even playing the game at all.  VALUE: I'd say it would take the average player about 20 hours to get Icon, and unlock mostly everything in the game. You can get more time of course by grinding out the Icon ranks and such, but I would only see players doing this in prepping for PvP. By using the Dollar per Hour scale, that costs the average consumer about $3 per hour. That's not terrible value, but if this game launched without missing content, you would get much more value per dollar. At least most won't get the Ultimate edition like I did and decrease the value even more.  FINAL THOUGHTS: The Crew launched as a an absolute mess. I don't think that anyone will say otherwise, even Ubisoft. It showed by how much effort they put into resurrecting that game from the dead. They updated the graphics, and also put out two of the best expansions in recent video game history besides the Witcher 3. To me, The Crew launched at about a 4/10. That's how much of a mess that game was. After Ubisoft fixed it, they got it to about an 8.5 in my books. I picked it up for free on Games with Gold, and it quickly became my favorite racing game after all of the expansions. And yes, this is coming from a Forza fanboy. The Crew had a slow start, but eventually gave itself a solid foundation for a sequel. Unfortunately what we got was a game with much better mechanics, yet stripped of all of it's basic content. It is with a heavy heart that I have to give such a bad review of my most anticipated game of the year, that's not named Smash Bros. Ultimate.  VERDICT: 6.5/10  TL;DR: Don't buy yet."
174689773,english,1,646910,"I have a feeling that this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car, and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies. Still worth the price tho, beautiful graphics and racists"
83579628,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is a whisker away from being a great game. You can spend an entire afternoon just enjoying the cars and driving without a specific purpose, while taking in some of the marvelous views, and it feels really good. However, the major downsides - ubiquitous copy-pasting and a rather scant number of genuine innovations  - don't allow me to recommend this game to absolutely everyone -  not just yet.  ⭐⭐⭐✰✰"
153623491,english,0,646910,"Just as a disclaimer, the Crew series is actually not bad, but for anyone who hasn’t noticed this yet, yesterday Ubisoft spontaneously delisted The Crew 1 and also announced that the game will be shutdowned and unplayable after March ’24. Sorry, this is absolutely inexcusable. They tried this with their DLCs last year (but rowed back due to the sh**storm), yet seriously, now this again??!! Don’t get me wrong, The Crew 1 is actually a great game which has quite some single player story content, obviously even an offline mode is integrated hidden in the files (due to some programmers in the community who are working on a mod, see the forum discussions), so there’s obviously no real reason to not give us customers (who paid for all those expensive season passes and DLCs) an offline function. Ubisoft really needs to stop their extremely toxic anti-consumer behavior, because meanwhile even I (I always defended them in the past) am losing interest in their products. And another joke, if you want to complain at the moment, there’s even no official Ubisoft internet forum anymore, only one on Discord (where all discussions get lost anyway). Uggh, sorry, this just had to get out, it’s just super frustrating.   And regarding The Crew 2, yeah, if we tolerate this behavior, The Crew 2 will go the same way, as will probably go a lot of other Ubisoft games with multiplayer online integration."
174895903,english,1,646910,"Alright. [i]The Crew 2[/i]. Judging from the current all-time high concurrent peak player counts for the game, I'd say a lot of people are aware of this game currently being priced at one dollar (and less in some regions). And a lot of people have bought the game as a result of this stunning deal. Including myself. Just to get it out of the way, if you have something to say about The Crew 1's removal, go to the game forum. I'm not interested in the topic as part of this review. So...  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984820  I am confident I would never have bought this game had it not been a buck, and I'm also confident that a lot of people have the same opinion. But since it was a buck, I did in fact buy it, and I'm glad I did. It's hella fun. The gameplay loop of joining events and races, using the cash you earn to buy new vehicles and such, and upgrading your vehicles with loot rewards from events and races, is pretty simple. But it is also effective. As you progress, you will unlock more events and races, and because they are located across the lower 48 States, you get a wide variety of settings for everything. From cities to mountains to forests to lakes to deserts to meteor craters to rain to snow to beaches and on and on, there is a vast array of different types of courses and tracks to enjoy. And there are a wide variety of types of races and events as well. From standard track races to boat races to plane aerobatics to demolition derbies, and so on.  The sheer volume of content is quite impressive. And, the various vehicles, be they cars or trucks or bikes or planes or boats or dune buggies or whatever...they all handle nicely and feel good to drive in. Each of these is upgradeable in many ways, which will increase their performance, handling, speed, and just generally make them function better and better as you progress.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329984770  There is a campaign of sorts, where you try to become the lead racer in a few different styles, but it's also easy enough to ignore that in favor of simply racing around, upgrading your vehicles, wandering around your crib, and simply free roaming. And free roaming is a lot of fun in and of itself. Mostly, it's a huge sightseeing trip, where you can also try to beat other player's records with jumps, speed, and so on; that you come across while driving around. And setting some records of your own for other people to beat. And there is a decent photography mini game all across the States where you will take pictures of animals, special vehicles and such to gain more cash and follower.  And gaining followers is really the sub goal that most impacts your playthrough. The number of followers you have determines how popular your racer is, which in turn unlocks new vehicle options and race/event options. Just about everything you do will earn you new followers (and cash).  Also, you can play with other players and even if you're not, you will see them all over the map. At this moment in time (the time of this review being written), no matter where you are, somebody else is nearby. And there are a lot of player created activities as well. Plus, you can co-op with friends if you get bored of solo play. So really, the content just keeps expanding as you explore what the game has to offer.  Visually, the game looks great. It has a 60 FPS cap, which isn't anything to brag about, but somehow, the devs have made the most out of that limitation and made a game that has a never-ending supply of screenshot moments. The audio is also well done. The songs themselves are very cool. The dialogue is basically all ""hey bro"" Extreme Games fodder, but it's fun and definitely appropriate.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3330111663  You will need Ubisoft Connect to play this. I don't care at all about that, but you might. And some people are having an issue with the game crashing if they have other non-Steam clients linked to their Ubi account. I have not had that issue personally and have it linked to both PSN and Epic as well, but if you do, you will need to unlink everything except Steam and that will resolve the crashing issue apparently. No idea how or why that is what it is or why it only affects some players. It's been a bug free experience for me though with a 3070 and an i5.  Now, should you also buy the season pass? I personally have no intention of doing so. There's no new content, and I don't care about getting a few extra cars and some swag. But the base game, offering what can easily be hundreds and even thousands of hours of content for one dollar. That is something I can definitely get behind. I can't think of a better deal in gaming at this moment. Now, if you miss or skip this one-dollar promotion they have going on right now, value will be more of...you know..., a [i]your mileage may vary[/i] type thing....

174302344,english,1,646910,"Forza Horizon fan.  Having fun in Crew 2 with all the different vehicle and event types.  C2 runs smooth, no bugs, and each event type is well designed and implemented.  Only frustration, I did not reach Platinum division in the Summit my first week. Being rich in Forza means you can buy and tune a competitive vehicle.  In Crew 2, you buy the base vehicle, but you have to grind for upgrade parts.   FH has classes (B, A, S1, S2).  C2 does not.  All vehicles of same type in C2 have same max tune value. FH no Nitro, C2, Nitro is primary factor. C2, no Auction House nor any way to sell vehicles. C2, leaderboards are more integral, and are a focus of endgame/seasons (Summit). I have over 700 vehicles in FH5.  In C2 earning vehicles is a MUCH slower process, and so far, I don't see much incentive to collect cars, beyond appearance and Summit requirements.  Do different Street Race cars handle differently at max stats??  excluding part affixes and awd."
43308733,english,0,646910,"If I had to sum up this game in one word, that word would be ""inconsistent"". The core racing experience is fun, and the open-world is still a thrill to just fly, race and drift around. However, there are definetly some irks that hold it back:  ""That's solid? really?"" - you'll find yourself saying this a fair bit, unfortunately. Whilst bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts and even traffic fold up like they're made of crisps and ping off into space, trees and parked cars are merciless, utterly solid, and occasionally placed exactly where you think you can get that little shortcut.  The AI: Rubberband doesnt even sum the AI up. In fact, it's barely worth trying to drive fast, as they will ALWAYS catch up to you and press their hidden hyperspace buttons the second you overcook a corner. Incredabily frustrating sometimes when you've been in the lead for 95% of the race, then get taken out by a suprise bus on the last corner and finish stone-dead last. Hard mode races up the challenge significantly, but dont be surprised to see the AI disappear over the draw distance within 10 seconds of the start if you havn't grinded out those upgrades for your vehicles.  The Story: If I had to guess, I'd say The Crew 2 was designed to be faaaar more ambitious in it's storytelling. The cutscenes and dialogue you get occasionally before or after a race feel really disjointed, as if there's a big chunk of the story you missed somewhere. One place it particularly confised me was one of the Rival races, where suddenly the mentor who's been urging you on all this time suddenly heel turns so rapidly it's surprising he doesnt do himself an injury, and opens a cutscene by telling your mechanic, Hiro, that you've somehow betrayed him and he wants a race... by doing what he wanted you to and winning races... huh? It just made me confused. Add to this the artsy cutscenes full of pseudo-philosophical commentary that honestly makes zero sense to pop up when they do, and overall the impression that there was a lot of story removed that might have linked these sections together can't be ignored.  There is a lot of good though. The racing is fun, the sensation of speed is excellent, the environments (especially out in the countryside with deserts and the Grand Canyon) are gorgeous and run well, and it really shines when you're just having fun in the open world. Just not in Monster Trucks. Never Monster Trucks. They just... no. horrible.  To sum up, there is a huge amount of potential here. It just needs filling out, and as such in it's present state I can't really recommend it for full price. Maybe after a few updates, it will start to fulfil it's potential. So who made this game again? Oh. Ubisoft. Don't count on the potential being filled then."

43274957,english,0,646910,"Disgusting rubberbanding makes the game so un-enjoyable. Race perfectly and the ai will be right behind you the entire time even if your vehicle is 50 points faster. Of course it's the same the other way around as well, you can eat shit in a ditch and be right behind the leader of the race 10 seconds later because they basically slow down to a crawl if you fall behind, which is incredible because as soon as you pull ahead of them by 5-6 seconds the ai can start to take perfect turns going twice as fast as you like the car is on rails instead of tires. Even worse is the fact that the game punishes you for using your breaks. It's legitimately faster to ride the side rail of a corner and hold the boost than to bother to slow down and take a proper turn.  PSA: I'm honestly super surprised I actually have to explain this here but to everyone commenting about the problem being connection or cpu or w/e else, rubberbanding ai is not a term for lagging. Rubber band AI refers to a feature of artificial intelligence found in racing titles that is designed to prevent players from getting too far ahead of computer-controlled opponents.   Edit: I'm making a sidenote for all the people who are real grumpy about the bad reviews, the base of the game itself is nice. It feels great to freeroam around the map. The physics could have used a bit more tuning but aside from that the cars control as you would expect from a good arcade racer. The problem lies beyond that in the ai. The oponents can decide to hit warpspeed to catch up to you whenever they damn well please. It's not as obvious in disciplines like hypercar racing and the F1 syle discipline, but street races are absolutely atrocious to play. I honestly believe if Ubi went back and fixed some of their problems the game could be great, but as it is, it feels like a big mess. Also, always online game and no PvP for another 5-6 months is a pathetic joke."

50261820,english,0,646910,"I played the game in 4k on a 3080 with an XBOneX Pro controller. All detail was maxed except AA and blur. I do not recommend a keyboard and mouse.  PLEASE NOTE, even though I have left comments on, I am not interested in you telling me that I should put 4000 hours into a game I don't enjoy so I can ""git good"", and then I would like it. That is a stupid argument. Don't be stupid. Skill is not indicative of enjoyment, and I have better things to do than bash my head on what I personally feel are bad / mediocre games on the off chance I could maybe like them one day. I have a life and don't play games to develop Stockholm syndrome.  Neutrals: - There are 25-minute single races. In an arcade racing game. I hated this. You may not.  Pros: - Most of the time, it ran at 60 FPS. - Large map, but...  Cons: - There is little to see on the map that's interesting. Sometimes the trees change type, and maybe there's more water in an area. - The upgrade system is painfully bad and is essentially a lootbox minus a box. You win a race, you get some random upgrades. You can have, say, LVL 65 in every part but one and it may take you 20 races to get an upgrade for that slot. Yes, you can get RNG'd into having to grind races to upgrade. It's as bad as it sounds. - VERY hard to read tracks when racing. Sometimes you'll just go in the wrong direction because you have no clue where you are intended to go. You essentially have to watch the minimap because watching the race itself is useless as the tracks are signposted more poorly than any other racing game I've played in recent memory. - The AI is tuned incredibly poorly. Either they're WAY ahead of you even though you're driving a better car and the race is half your level, or you're absolutely demolishing them. There is no adjusting this. It is infuriating. - All the cars control like they're racing on butter. Everything slides uncontrollably and really shows off how shoddy the physics are in this game. You will constantly careen into stuff. And speaking of... - Hitting damn near anything brings you to a complete stop. You don't slide past stuff like other arcade racing games when the corner of your car clips a bush, you come to a complete halt. You now have to restart the race because you WILL NOT catch up. Is the race 12 minutes long? Too bad. Now to find that race reset... - The menus are awful. I had to actually Google how to restart a race and quit the game. Thought they'd be in the in-game menus? Hah, you simpleton! You have to hit Y to bring up a special menu that hides in the corner of the screen, but only comes up while driving! Want that menu on a keyboard & mouse? NOPE! Those buttons sometimes show up at the bottom of a different menu where you may have expected them in the first place! Well, sometimes. Only when the option for the buttons feels like appearing. Sometimes it just doesn't. - The characters are astoundingly annoying and are written to speak like a Red Bull commercial. The overtly positive ""might as well be saying nothing at all"" style garbage non-speaking flows out of everyone's mouth continually. The story is non-existant. If you love chasing ""followers"" (ugh), then go on Instagram and be vapid there. Even the shell of a life you pretend to have there will be more fun than The Crew 2. - Very odd and frequent framerate drops when physics items interact with each other. This happens often. Adjusting settings did not help. - It looks worse than the original did somehow, and the first was quite an ugly game. - One of the worst game soundtracks I've heard since Gone Home. This low-budget mess of a soundtrack complete with incredibly shrill lady-punk songs. The only good song on the soundtrack is Airbourne - Running Wild, and it's over 10 years old. Yes that's an opinion, and your mileage may vary. - I am an idiot and preordered the Gold Edition because, hey, this is a sequel. It's going to improve on the original in many ways. (Narrator: ""It did not."") They didn't listen to a single damn complaint about the original, even though nearly every review both professional and amateur said the same things (Many of which are pointed out in my review here). This makes me madder. You couldn't even be bothered to fix the obvious? Bad form, Ubisoft. - They haven't improved on any of these complaints since launch and instead insist on putting out boring Live Events. This is because Live games make more money (See Destiny). Make no mistake, this is a product, not art and it definitely wants all of your money. - I genuinely tried to like it and power through some of the issues, but I just can't any more. I hate this game. It is one of the worst racing games I have played in recent memory. Even the two most recent Need For Speed games were better, and they were mediocre at the best of times.  UPDATE: Tried it again several years down the road. Holy god there is so much seasonal crap slathered everywhere, and random things to level that they're trying to sell you it was nearly impossible to figure out what to do next. This somehow got even grosser than it was. Oh, and even though the menus have changed, they now make LESS sense due to the sheer amount of layered-on garbage that, AND I still couldn't find a way to quit. I had to Alt + F4."
43211268,english,0,646910,"This game is an improvement over the first one which I defended to be honest. The addition of planes and boats was a great one.  However, I won't give this game a postiive review because Ubisoft intentionally downgraded the game. By that I speak of landmarks. Of all the landmarks they had in The Crew 1, they were all very accurate in terms of shape and relative location. They even had the same ones in the E3 demo. But they decided to remove a lot of them or make them inaccurate for no good reason. If it is a technical reason, it is pure lazyness on the devs part and they jusst used a cheap dirty workaround to fix an issue they had.  I am quite disappointed with the map downgrades. I feel that rather than removing the landmarks, they should have created accurate new ones to further enhance the cities. I will admit the random buildings do look better in this game but the lack of landmarks irritates me.    -In New York the Metlife building, Yankee Stadium, Chrysler Building etc were removed, and the Empire State building was replaced with an inaccurate model. -In Detroit the bridge crossing over to Candida was removed. -In Los Angeles, the City Bank building was altered and is no longer accurate. -The military base north of Chicago was removed. -Downgrades made which decrease the detail to the Hoover Dam  Now Chicago, my home town, got hit hard by the pointless downgrading. About 70 percent of the landmarks were removed. -Sears Tower was removed (Even non Chicago natives will notice this one. Bad decision. Makes me wonder what is wrong with the dev/designer who thought that was a good idea.) -Thompson Center was removed -LaSalle Street Metra was station removed -United Center is gone -Solder Field is gone -The Diamond Building is also gone -The airport was removed (REALLY BAD choice giving the fact the game now has airplanes) -The accurate recreation of Navy Pier was replaced by a bunch of the random filler buildings and props you see all over the map. They are munched together like some kid would make if the game had some kind of map editor which let you place buildings. -The curved building where the river forks was removed. (Forgot the name) -Skyscraper directly south of Sears Tower removed (Also forgot the name) -The Chase Bank building is gone.   What makes me mad is that it is the same map as the first game. You will get a better US road trip experiance in The Crew 1 as the cities featured actually look like the way they are supposed to. They intentionally downgraded it. This game has good gameplay, but screwing up the map makes me belive this game is incomplete and therefore doesn't get a positive review. I'll change my review when Ubisoft restores the content they removed intentionally.  Once Ubisoft corrects their dumb mistakes and gives us the United States road trip experiance that The Crew 1 had, I will change my review."

50314368,english,0,646910,"Crew 2 was controversial at start and ran out of content in 3 months, lost its playerbase in 5 months, Season Pass has been nothing but a scam. About year after launch, big update comes with three new cars (wow!) and MICROTRANSACTIONS (they are only cosmetic and premium currency can be obtained in some ways but donating is much easier). It's Ubisoft, remember, no fun allowed. Even the first Crew had a better potential of holding playerbase with different bodykits to all cars and good crate system even considering the fact that it wasn't at release. Honestly, whole economic system in Crew 2 is messed up, money are really hard to get and best cars cost horribly high, even though $1,4kk car can show similar or even worse performanse than $350k due to ""pro settings"" and parts which you can switch between cars of the same class and which define the most of car's stats, all you're buying is basically a skin with some advantages (base stats are slightly different nonetheless). Open-world activities are ok, but not profitable, and not all races are profitable as well. There are a lot of them, and developers even add some every now and then, but the main problem is that you are granted with no rewards by completing certain percentage of all races in one class, so there is no point completing all of them - you only get vehicle reward after you beat any story boss, but all you get is mediocre car and trash helicopter which you can't even use in a race. It's easier to find a good relaxing race and farm money there 'till you faint and it seems that it's what most players do. I can't feel a soul in Crew 2. Making matters worse, it's just fucking tedious and grind-based mediocre car game. This vomitous scheme ""Grind money to get a better car to grind more money using it"". No immersion effect (as in FH4), bad car handling and collision physics, terrible optimisation with painful launches and many, many other bad things. It's year after, not the release date state. When hearing news about Ubisoft making a live-service you should await a death-service."
43572491,english,0,646910,"As I played about 200+ hours in The Crew 1 I have to admit that in The Crew 2 I got bored after 20 hours already.  So let's talk about the things:  1. Price - way too much for this game. Wait for a sale if you REALLY want to play it BADLY. I didn't have fun when playing this game, which shocked me though, because The Crew 1 brought me so much fun. Very disappointing.  2. Map - landmarks are gone, they kinda replaced it with Photo Albums, which is not that bad, however it's kinda annoying (at least for me). Map is huge, but feels totally empty and unused, since they took fast travel to random places away and the map is unlocked, since the beginning, so not much of a grind to be fair. 3. AI - feels really weird sometimes. Sometimes it works normally and sometimes it's just impossible. I had the most issues with Drag Racing where I actually had to watch tutorials to have a chance to beat someone on normal (and no i'm not a total noob, the timing is just so crucial that you need to learn it, which is ridiculous). For beginners the AI is way too OP. If you new and want to have fun you will get frustrated really quickly.  4. Vehicles - probably the biggest plus in this game. There's a wide range of cars, etc., however, with all the classes (boats, planes) it doesn't feel like a REAL racing game anymore. 5. Story - Overall cringe atmosphere, a forced ""legal"" environment with big parties all over the freaking country. All nice places, which I enjoyed in The Crew 1 just for the nature are now covered with stupid banners and fancy lights, etc. etc. which takes the feeling away. The whole ""story"" is just a collection of short events, which are apparently huge in the so called TV.  6. Miscellaneous - The followers are replacement of the XP, which is not tragic, but probably annoyed many players who played TC1. The stupid chants after every race or completed skill and music is just annoying.   Overall it's a huge disappointment, there's not much room for grind. I completed all the races for all categories + all skills on 100 % in about 20 hours. I could do the photo albums and buy all vehicles, but the game is just not fun.  If you're new and you want to give it a try wait for a sale. If you're a passioned racing gamer or you played The Crew 1 don't buy this game. That's my OWN OPINION."
43432845,english,0,646910,"Pros: 1. Graphics are ok, but could have been better for a 2018 game. 2. Good car selection and upgrades.  Cons:  1. Cringeworthy voice acting and poorly made cutscenes. 2. Car handling feels like you are driving on snow. 3. Poor wheel support, at least they tried to improve it though. 4. Story is nonexistent, feels like they put a random plot on the last stages of the game. 5. Landmarks from the first game are gone. 6. AI is awful. 7. Map is huge but feels so empty, also the game unlocks the entire map by default so the game don't give you a reason to explore it.  Resuming: Not worth the full price, buy it in a sale and hope you have some fun with it.  FOR THOSE WHO SAY I ONLY PLAYED 0.8HRS OF THE GAME I played the beta on UPlay and my playtime says I have 6 hours on it. It's basically the same game."

You're basically here for the map or nothing else, and even that amazing map remains underutilized.

It's a good buy for those who loved the first Crew - and its spiritual predecessors, the two Test Drive Unlimited games - and no one else."
45881599,english,1,646910,a decent casual open world racing game. recommended for people looking for such an experience.  pros - huge open world.entire map of usa slightly scaled down to explore. you can have a big road trip on your own or with friends. vehicle variety - the game is not limited to cars alone but boats planes and bikes as well. lots of different racing disciplines - ranging from street racing to grand prix to moto cross and rally cross. also featured is a cross country hyper car race - goes from east coast to west coast.40 minutes for a single lap race covering the entire width of usa. a great experience in itself. leisurely driving across the grand canyon or other such iconic places has its own novelty. acquiring the cars and upgrading them is satisfying. the set races are well made. snow and rain look nice. graphically the game is good but not upto the standards of other modern racing games like forza  cons -  game is completely arcadish with 0 damage functionality and the physics are very simplistic.its not meant for realistic racing at all. no real pvp features yet (there is an update in the works but no idea how or what it will be)
118350135,english,1,646910,Let me start this off by saying if you only plan on playing with a controller go for it which is why i'm recommending it ONLY if you're using a controller   If you have a sim rig or even just a basic setup with a wheel you will be extremely disappointed. The force feedback literally makes no sense. You'll be taking a corner and when the rear end slightly slips out from under you the force feedback just decides to fu*k off in a direction that makes no sense. There's an insane amount of options missing that would be in any racing game whether it's an arcade racer or sim with wheel support.   Next issue is the fact that for everyone on PC you are limited to 60 fps with no work around.....like...WHAT!?!? Iv'e literally never played a game on PC that limited my frames to that of a console. What was the thought process behind this decision?   Interface controls moving around the map with a wheel is extremely frustrating but you can get used to it  I have to scroll through every single wheel till I find the ones I want as there are no filter options unless I missed something but come on guys   On the vehicle selection screen there's these flashy light things grazing across the car tabs and is super annoying / makes it hard to see what you're looking at  Some of the cars wheels maximum size still are too small and makes the tires look like they should be on a rally car  Just because we have a sim rig doesn't mean we are limited to sim racers. Sometimes we just want to screw around in an open world environment and zone out which Horizon is great for but that's literally all we have and every NFS title with wheel support is probably even worse than this  In the end if your game is going to have wheel support why even bother having it in the game if you're not gonna do it right?
168231015,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 is a fairly good game but it's just a matter of time until ubisoft decides to pull the plug on this one, just like they did with the original Crew, If buying is not owning then piracy is not stealing."
103655459,english,0,646910,"This game is max quantity, zero quality. If you told me this game was designed by people who had never actually driven or sat in a car and everything they knew about driving was through bing searches and 80's action movies, it would all make sense. Then they added rpg elements with rng based loot. This is a parody of a driving game through the lens of the onion.  For example: this has time trial races with tiered time targets: easy, normal and hard. Let's say your brain is broken like me and you accept the challenge to 100% this game and learn the absurd and downright comical driving model which induces even hypercars to lift their inside rear tyre like a civic on hard turn in. Lets say you can easily beat the hard time with a stock car. You still gotta run the race 2 more times to complete it to get rewards. Every stupid race has to be done thee times. Every. Single. Event. This is just one among numerous issues.  Every single thing other than car customization is the commitee voting for the worst possible option every single time. Its like if twitch plays racing game development with assholes. Just don't buy this microtransaction hell. Even if this goes free to play. Don't be me."
115958990,english,1,646910,"OK.  I'm going to write this as someone who has been a huge fan of The Crew franchise.  The short answer is, ""Yes.  I'd recommend this game.""  The longer answer is a little more nuanced and if you'd like to read a few ""caveats"" from someone who still enjoys the game, mostly......please proceed.  I have played this game since launch.  I owned the ""Gold Edition"" on PS4 and logged A LOT of hours there.  I then made the switch to PC and, as you can see, I've logged over 200 more hours on here.  There are a lot of positives that any number of other reviews will also bring up.  There are also a lot of negatives, many of which are not immediately apparent.  And here is where I am going to bring these up.  They weren't severe enough for me to not recommend the game, but they were important enough for me to mention.  1.  No cross-platform support or cross-play (not too concerned about cross-play though)  It's one thing to not offer this.  It's another to have very specific rewards for completing certain events and not allow people who earned those rewards to carry them over (or even allow them to use MTX to buy them back on your new platform).  Don't get me wrong, if they asked me to pay money for items I already earned; I'd tell them to get bent.  However, this business model here actively discourages people from buying the game on more than one platform.  Seems stupid.  I have numerous cars earned from PS4 Summit, but because my Uplay account is logged in to a steam version of the game instead of a PS4 version of the game......I can't use them.  2.  It's pitched as ""any vehicle, anywhere, any time""  No.  It's not.  Sure, there are plenty of events and lots of different vehicles, but the lion's share of events and vehicles fall in to ""street race"".  There are more ""street race"" events than all the other ""Street HQ"" events combined.  There are more hypercars and street race cars than any other class except for MAYBE Rally Raid and Touring Car.  I don't mind these events/vehicles, but it would be nice to get something else.  It's especially bad for Summit as most ""special vehicle rewards"" are just another street spec or hypercar spec.  The ""Xtreme Series"" (one of the more unique aspects of the game) has less than ten events and that's after they added some.  3.  It's ""grindy"".  Again, clearly I don't mind the grind, but I'd be lying if I said a large majority of my time spent wasn't re-running the same handful of events for cash and parts.  The RNG is hell sometimes and certain vehicle types just get aggravating to get parts for.    For example.  I own full legendary part sets on every single hypercar I own.  I managed to do this in about a week simply re-running the New York hypercar event,  It nets about 300,000 bucks on Ace and yields a BUNCH of legendary parts.  The event is a long cross-country event and takes around 30 min to complete.  Simple enough.  Jump on, run it once or twice, net cash and parts.  But outside hypercars (and one or two street race events) there aren't any events like this for the other specs.  This is ESPECIALLY egregious, because they had stuff like that in the first Crew.  It would be nice if there was a better way of earning legendary sets without relying on Summit or getting to Icon 1000+ to dump a bunch of points in to buffing your loot quality and amount.    4.  ""Vanity Parts"" and ""Premium Currency""  I have an issue with ""pay to customize"", especially on a game where customizing is a key component to that experience.  It's one thing to pay $5 to have a gold gimp suit or some such crap on Battlefield or CoD.  It's another to have these ""pay parts"" on a game all about customizing.  It's made worse by the ""Season Passes"" having a ""regular"" and a ""premium"" version and even the premium pass doesn't net you enough Crew Credits to buy an epic vanity part.  You get a couple extra vehicles (probably another street spec or hypercar).  I mostly bring this up because they used to gift Crew Credits a bunch more and just by saving up a bit, you could put them to use in amazing ways and made you WANT to play.  5.  The ""Online"" Experience.  It's not great.  It's better than a lot I've seen, but it's still pretty bad.  I've had invites from all kinds of people,  almost none that actually want to do events.  You join someone's crew, you screw around on the map until someone gets bored.  Someone joins YOUR crew, they quit as soon as they realize you're starting an event.  Maybe it's time.  Maybe it's the platform.  I can't say for sure.  I CAN say, the social experience WAS better when I was on PS4.  Last but not least, this isn't Forza.  If you're expecting Forza, then buy Forza.  This is more akin to the GOOD Need for Speeds from back in the day (i.e. Most Wanted, Carbon, Underground).  The physics aren't great, but they aren't horrible.  It's mostly just designed to goof off with and have a good time......not recreating what driving a Bugatti is like.  If nothing I said dissuaded you, then give it a try.....and if you see me around, shoot me an invite.  Just don't be afraid of doing something."

Someone without dogshat taste in music is possibly still trapped at Ubisoft. We need to do all we can to rescue this person from their descent to french hell.   Which is a lot like normal hell but much more bougie & smelly."
140621252,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is an open world arcade racing game with the map being the literal entire USA, downscaled to videogame size obviously. Also, i'm hyped for Motorfest even though i'll have to wait another year because Ubisoft, once again, decided to go to Epic Games. They already did come back crawling because Epic didn't work as good as they thought and yet here we are looking at them doing the exact same mistake again missing out on tons of sales because of the selling platform ONLY. Anyways.  I have done every single peace of Content this game has to offer, from races to photo ops but ""skills"" too and i can tell you i hated almost everything about this game; special hate goes out to every single Boat and Plane activity. I loved playing it, i mean it made me play for 200h+ but i will not ignore how bad of a videogame it actually is  People complain about the Crew 2 but i think its for the wrong reasons; most of the critism is about the grindy aspect of this game and yes they are right it indeed is one of the grindiest racing games ever but to be absolutely honest.. i bought a racing game to win races, if the grind is based on racing then why would i complain? anyways, theres seemingly endless content to be played, most of it feels either the same or really really alike but i really appreciate the cheer amount of content Ivory Tower came up with, set peaces and special events really look and feel cool to go through but it is obvious that most of it were simple instagram filters being put onto your screen to make it feel different even if it mostly isn't.  Graphics are OKAY, it does look outdated compared to even older titles and the antialasing is basically non existent, the backmirrors do not work and your headlights are literally looking like transparent yellow JPGs to make it look like there was light but it actually is no light source at all inside the game engine, the steering wheel barely moves at higher speeds. It definetily has its moments though, it can look pretty and sometimes i had more NFS Underground Vibes than the past 5 Need for Speeds were able to get me but the fact the night time got literally massacred in order to cover up non functioning headlights really bothers me  Heres what i think is important to know before getting into it Anything you do, wether it be menu navigation or real time gameplay, it feels like a mobile game with PC features. Theres so many decisions made in design which simply go all against the user experience to make it as annyoing and uncomfortable as possible and i will have to give you a couple examples to make some sense of what i actually mean:   Every time you finish a race theres an unskippable animation playing telling you that you won, how much XP you got and how much money you earned, it takes almost 10 seconds every single time, right after that you'll see some funny colorfull packages spawning in front of your car so you collect them, these are literally random generated tuning parts which also have (feelingly) hundreds of additional passive effects besides pushing the cars perfomance. Once your inventory is full and you tuned up your car, you gotta dismantle the stuff you don't need and that.. takes way too much time. I could guess that 1/3 of my playtime was dismantling tuning parts only. This entire process is what you get for playing the game. The Tuning is based on RPG NUMBERS and STATS, its no new super duper new engine you build into your car, its literally the same thing now being purple instead of blue (rarity=quality) and the number goes up from 245 to 247.  Other than that the Visual Freedom of your car is astonishingly huge, less for the GT and Hyper Classes but more than ever in street race cars, generally the car selection is almost as impressive as Forzas is.  The AI in your races also base their difficulty on those RPG like ""Perfomance Numbers"", meaning your car has to have a ""220-Stat"" to be able to compete in that specific race; this system leads to the AI being either entirely broken or not existent at all. One side of the game makes you want to own as many cars and have as much variety as possible, on the other side theres really obvious differences in cars in same classes. Almost every Muscle Car feels underpowered as hell while other ""meta-cars"" will have no problems whatsoever; Some cars really do struggle a ton to keep up with the AI, others will make you simply drive the course to the finish line making it a personal time trial.  But wait! theres more! The Crew 2 has an RPG like Skill Tree. It enhanced passive things like ""slipstream power"", range, effectiveness, it enhanced your nitrous in 7 different ways and makes competing against other lower level people a joke; actually the PVP section of this game is dead since release because of the slipstream mechanic which is absolute BS, you can literally hear your car gaining +100HP as you drive behind your mate. This is a racing game, no MMORPG and most certainly no MOBA, i genuinenly do not understand how one could implement such things into a racing game, making a skill set almost obsolete (of course you still have to know how to drive lol)  Also, there is an ingame real-money shop for you to buy cosmetics, car bundles and battle pass though you can buy the battle pass with ingame money you get from playing  On the plus side though, i really like how easy accessable the multiplayer is. You invite your friend to the party, you choose a race and there you go, no overcomplicated crap needed for this.  I love playing this game but i seriously hate everything that comes with it. In sale for less than 15 bucks, its a good deal for the amount of content you get."
57370276,english,1,646910,"If you've played the first game, then there is some returning stuff that you're already familiar with. The big-ass map, the various racing categories, [b]the grinding[/b], the fact that you'll most likely never own all the vehicles.  Pros: - Planes and boats are fun, the quick vehicle swap function too. - The loot system has been improved (unless you really liked to grind for hours for each car individually). Parts can be exchanged within the category, meaning that you'll get new parts based on the highest parts you own, for any vehicle of the same category. You can buy a brand new, vanilla car, and just install maxxed out parts you already own. - Live Summit events are good.  Mids: - The ""you own one car and can outfit it for several categories"" system got scrapped. You just own a car for a specific category. Maybe it's also available in a different category, maybe it's not. - The ""story"" and most characters. At this point, they should just give up the narrative part. Nobody cares, and it's not very interesting. The issue is that it's an arcade game whose very scope makes it hard to explain stuff (you're not going to be surprised by an NFS game being about illegal street racing, but how do you justify the plethora of vehicles available in the Crew? Well... maybe you shouldn't.)  Cons: - Hiro and most in-race announcers and commentary. Gets old reeeaaaal fast. - Just like in the Crew 1, the driving experience can rank from pleasant to extremely frustrating and clunky. - Can take a while to get into a PvP race due to the player population and the waiting system sucks (being able to join ""on-call"" à la GTAO would be great). - Having to actually go into HQs or your house and walk around to perform actions. Who's got time for that? Why can't I just do it from the menus? - Speaking of the menus... Pointless animations, loading times... And the submenu for the radio that also contains race-related options. That shit is whack.  So, is this a transcending experience? Nah. But it can be fun. Get it if you liked the first one, or if you wanna play with friends.  1) Stay away [u]2) Recommended when on sale or for a specific audience[/u] 3) Recommended 4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must play"
43232418,english,0,646910,"So much AI Rubberbanding it's not even funny, Cringeworthy dialogue, Poor vehicle handling, Microtransactions. Wait for Forza Horizon 4."
43416459,english,0,646910,"If you want to buy this because you think it improved from The Crew 1 keep your money. I couldnt even get a refund even though Iv explained to support how cheap this game is. They used the more than 2 hours of play excuse, I had 4 at the time and thats counting all the cinematics, you basically cant see how cheap it is before passing the 2 hours mark. Keep your money."
54748485,english,1,646910,"After 50 hours, The Crew 2 has left me with a lot of wonderful memories. They aren't filled with the kind of emergent stories you get from exploring an open world and its systems, nor are they moments that involve goofing around with strangers--The Crew 2 is lacking in both those aspects. Instead, my memories are filled with the game's variety of vehicular activities and the wonderfully curated tracks: the unrealistic, the impossible, and the delightful.  It's surprising to see just how much The Crew 2 differs from the original game. There's been a noticeable shift in Ubisoft’s last few open-world titles, one that's moving toward a focus on player-driven progression--large selections of optional activities, non-linear structures, rewards for doing just about anything--and The Crew 2 benefits significantly from this direction. The gritty crime angle from the original game is gone, and instead, The Crew 2 takes reams of pages from the book of Forza Horizon. The game centers on a nationwide festival of motorsports where you, a rookie, are poised to become the next big star. While the setup is conventional, and the focus on social media fame is obnoxious, what it brings to the game is a colorful and upbeat vibe, an impressive variety of different disciplines, and positively ridiculous arcade driving on land, water, and through the air.  Despite the game's focus on real-world branding and mimicry of televised motorsports, The Crew 2's greatest asset is its willingness to be ridiculous. Races in The Crew 2 might involve jumping your street-racing car off skyscrapers, or your powerboat off the Hoover Dam. They might include making high-speed touring cars go head to head through the tight, windy Hollywood Hills, and motocross bikes take jumps across shipping freighters and freeways right before you transform into a prop plane like some kind of extreme-sports mecha. This is a game that will cover Los Angeles in three feet of snow for no logical reason other than icy roads make for more thrilling street races. Abundant nitro boosts, uncomplicated drifting, and generous rubber-banding also help keep the act of driving exciting when things are relatively tame.  As a game with an open world, races and challenges can naturally be found and initiated when you stumble across them at particular points on the map. However, playing The Crew 2 with open-world exploration as your primary means of moving from activity to activity reveals the game's major downfall: it's too big, and all the activities and interesting locations are too spread out. The game hides a number of boxes with vehicle components across the map, which you can hunt for using a proximity tracker, but even these feel too few and far between.  But with that in mind, The Crew 2 thankfully makes it easy to cut your commute down via player-friendly shortcuts. The game has an option to view all 120+ primary activities and countless more skill challenges (featuring things like escapes, slaloms, and a rewarding photo mode) in a categorized, list-style view, with the option to not just set a waypoint to them, but instantly start them no matter where you are in the world, at no cost. The loading times in The Crew 2 are impressively brief all around, so if you want to, you can churn through races and challenges back-to-back to very quickly and efficiently rack up progression points, earn cash, and set leaderboard positions from the moment you start.  It's an option that's both convenient and gives the impression that the game is conscious of your time. Likewise, any activity can be restarted or aborted in seconds if you're having a bad run, and there's a quick back-on-track feature that can be used any time. When you're not in an event you can switch to any vehicle you own immediately, without penalty, and without having to go anywhere. That's on top of being able to assign a favorite ground vehicle, boat, and plane to your right analog stick to allow for instantaneous switching during free-roam exploration, which provides its own kind of fun, for example, flying into the stratosphere with your plane before switching to a boat and careening back to Earth. Any vehicle that's available for sale is also graciously available for you to test drive on a moment's notice.  The variety of different vehicular disciplines in The Crew 2 is downright impressive--each of the 14 styles is tangibly unique from one another. Every time I started to get fatigued with one method of competition, I could quickly jump to another that had a completely different feel. Each is housed within one of four ""Families"" which you're free to move between to perpetuate your overall progress: Street (street racing, drifting, drag racing, long-distance hypercar racing), Offroad (cross-country rally raid, motocross, loose-surface rallycross), Freestyle (plane aerobatics, jet sprint boating, monster trucking), and Pro (power boating, air racing, touring cars, and grand prix).  While the execution of The Crew 2's disciplines might not wholly satisfy purists of any one given style, it does a great job of making each feel accessible, fun, and unique. I'm usually too intimidated by grand prix racing to give it a shot in other games, and I would never have even considered the idea of playing a power boating game. But, the Crew 2 encourages you to try a little bit of everything, and it's easy thanks to the game's approachable arcade-style mechanics, as well as the prospects of seeing more beautiful and ludicrous tracks.  And whether you're driving, boating, or flying across The Crew 2's America, it's a mostly beautiful journey. The game's natural environments, particularly bodies of water and the sky, look fantastic, as do weather effects like snow and rain. All are enhanced to breathtaking heights by the superb lighting, though the continuous day/night and weather cycle can be an occasional inconvenience during some events--whether it be afternoon sun in your eyes, snow obscuring track obstacles, or having to fly through a tight canyon in complete darkness. Where the visuals visibly falter are in dense urban areas. You likely won't notice buildings when you're zooming past them at 200km/h, but any slower and you can't help but notice how plain they are, especially in broad daylight with clear skies. Character models, on the other hand, always look incredibly basic, no matter the situation.  The game's RPG-style vehicle upgrade system returns from the original game, though it still doesn't feel particularly meaningful. You'll receive loot after every race in various stages of rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic), and each corresponds to a particular vehicle part and has its own power number, which contributes to your vehicle's overall power number. There is some small benefit to this system--all vehicles of a particular class, despite having different power levels in their stock configuration, will max out at the same number, meaning you can stick with your favorite car all the way up to and through the endgame.  I'm annoyed by the game's lack of public interaction and meaningless gear system, but I'll fondly recall both the tension of flinging sprint boats back and forth through the narrow, artificial canals of The Venetian in Las Vegas, and the easygoing satisfaction of an hour-long hypercar race from New York to San Francisco, where I listened to a podcast and enjoyed the rolling scenery. Despite its shortcomings, The Crew 2 still displays admirable strengths, which lie in its player-friendly features, freedom of movement, and its willingness to bend the rules in order to make things exciting and varied for an accessible, American-themed thrillride."
43896580,english,1,646910,"✓ 150 Hours ✓ Completed 100% of the game content ✓ Completed 100% of the achievements  Here is a rundown of Pros and Cons, with explanations, along with a score breakdown and final conclusion.  Pros:      • Captivating           -With each race comes different tracks, different skips, and different means of completing. With a percentage displaying the completion of a discipline (style of race) and an online competitive track time it’s very easy to get stuck into this game. Though a track can be completed it can always be done better, this factor is what drives the racers to become faster and better.      • Updated Often      • Good portrayal           -The game does an accurate portrayal of each discipline. Whether one loves Street Racing, Off-Roading, Free-Styling, or Pro-Racing, The Crew 2 provides just what one’d believe this discipline would be like.      • Tuning           -With tuning, and even pro-tuning, each vehicle may be adjusted to preferred likings. Tuning can make or break, quite literally, a vehicle. These tuning options can add Top Speed, Power, 0-60, Quarter Mile, and more.       • Great for a completionist           -The Crew 2 is not easy to complete, but it is easy to manage and observe the progress. Each discipline comes with a percentage of completion. In game, there is also an option to pin desired missions to track progress real time.   Cons:      • Poor story           -There is little to no story on this game. Your objective is to simply “become the champion”, which is done by just racing. The story focuses on being “follower famous” which is well, I guess a good portrayal of 2018.      • Awful commentary           -The commentary is quite laughable. Some lines do not make sense to even be mentioned, while others are just repeated.      • Inconsistency           -It’s somewhat of a hit or miss, funny pun, on which items are moveable. Some large trees are destructible while other small tables are not.      • Iffy graphics           -At times the graphics are phenomenal, at other times it’s feels like I’m back in 2007. The photo editor is very solid, but the in-game scenery is lacking.      • Poor reward           -Even when completing disciplines, there is hardly any reward. The only rewarding system is given after playing many hours and becoming the status of “Icon”.  -Scoring- Content 7/10 Graphics 5/10 Story Line 3/10 Score, 15/30, 5/10, 50%  -Conclusion- I purchased a racing game and I believe that’s what I got. Though the game is lacking in commentary and story, that’s not what I personally purchased it for. I purchased it to race, which is what this game excels at. The Crew 2 is a very entertaining racing game that will certainly give hours of enjoyment (as long as you don’t care about story line and such)."
91366795,english,1,646910,"Well well well!  It's 6 months now since i bought this one and i decided after 111 hours of gameplay to review it.  [h1]First the alternative titles i would give this game.[/h1]  Ford Focus hating simulator  Epic Car Wallpaper maker  Bugatti porn  The faster hatchbacks  The Crew 2 sponsored by Ford, Bugatti, Dodge and Chevrolet.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  The gameplay itself is really good, the tutorial (well it's a Ubisoft game there isn't much to expect) isn't well thought of in my opinion.  You start of with a vehicle the game gives you to finish your first mission.  After that you've been given a (rather small) selections of vehicles/cars for free.  The further you progress into the game the more options and challenges as well as vehicles get unlocked.  For the cars for example Ubisoft decided to help you progress by giving you a free Aston Martin Vanquish (which honestly helps a lot).  The game itself offers you various types of challenges and gamemodes so you never get bored.  When it comes to missions, i sadly have to mention that the npcs even on the higher difficulty seem to struggle sometimes. Weather conditions while in a mission are nice but could cost you your lead since it looks like the npcs don't struggle with it as you do.  More to that later on.  [h1] Design [/h1]  Even on a lower setting the design and graffics are good enough for amazing screenshots.  The cars are well detailed like the real life ones, you have a very simplified map and speedometer and the menus aren't in any way confusing.  The settings are nicely ordered which is consumer friendly.  [h1] The good things [/h1]  Amazing graphics with great detailing.  Good and constructive gameplay.  A good variety of vehicles to choose from.  A photo mode with a great variety of settings to make your perfect screenshots.  A huge and well detailed map of the US  A lot of missions and challenges to choose from.  [h1] The bad/salty things [/h1]  As stated earlier, weather conditions with bad traffic could easily ruin your race.  The Navigation responds very slow and bugged since the last update  The developers seem to gotten sponsored by the car manufactorers mentioned earlier because of the sheer amount of cars of each brand that are in the game.  Some car manufactorers that have produced amazing cars e.g. Toyota, Lancia, Skoda are completely left out which is sad to be honest.  The tutorial isn't really helpful when you haven't played the game before.  [h1] The confusing things [/h1]  For example, the aero of all the cars (even those with a huge rear spoiler) isn't considered even though the game tries to be really realistic  AWD(All-wheel-drive)-Cars like the BMW M8 behave like RWD(Rear-wheel-drive)-Cars, but FWD(Front-wheel-drive)-Cars behave like RWD-Cars with more traction  Some stats of the cars are confusing: VW Golf GTI 0 - 100 km/h   2.4 seconds HP: 550                                                               Bugatti Veyron 0 - 100km/h 2.6 seconds HP: about 1670  The weight of the cars aren't mentioned and most likely not even considered in the game.  So how could your regular Golf GTI with FWD be faster from 0 - 100km/h than a hypercar that costs irl like 3.5 million Euros?  [h1] My verdict [/h1]  It is a great game with a few twists but you can enjoy it in any way you like since it's an open-world game with many options and way to play it.  Do you like to just casually drive around?  You can just do it.  Or crash into the statue of liberty with a plane for fun?  Yeah go on.  The game won't force you to play it in a specific way.  So in short i recommend it if you like cars like i do.  Short notice: Please do not take this review all so seriously since it's my honest opinion on it."
43355631,english,0,646910,"UPDATE 7/13/2018: Just wanna' add in here that you will win most races, which I have been, you just have to grind parts for a couple of hours and keep your vehicle up to date or you will get smoked by the AI. Of course it's considered common sense I suppose, but it's also a bit repetitive as well. Nevertheless, I still think the mechanics of this game are ""Ridge Racer Type R4 bump the wall lose race"" type of sh*t. But it's not too, too bad. ____________________________________________________________  So far, after spending about 26 hours on the game, it seems like all you do is mindlessly race for better car parts against AI Jesus, and while that is of course the point of the game, in The Crew 1 it felt like there was more to it as you could venture off and visit landmarks all around the USA instead of racing, learning about known areas of the country while getting paid 2,000 bucks for each landmark you visit.... which seemed (imo) to cator to people who just like to drive around, and it also had PvP at the start. There seemed to be an actual story in The Crew 1 from what I recall also. Story in this game (TC2) feels like they went a TDU2 (Test Drive Unlimited 2) direction, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'll tell you what IS bad, mindlessly grinding against the ""holier than thou, on rails"" AI for car parts, requiring you to race damn near perfect. But I'll get to that here in a second don't you worry....  Also, what's the point of having a house or garage in this game if you can't even do sh*t with it yet? Can't customize it, can't have people over, can't do jack squatty. Seems like some azz backwards logic by the devs if you ask me.  I was also doing a Hypercar race heading towards Miami, paused the game, unpaused and suddenly there's snow everywhere down south and in Miami. Needs fixed asap. Funny thing is, I mentioned this when I sent a bug report during closed beta, guess they didn't get around to it yet? Idk.  In this game it's just the same sh*t over and over again, race after race against the computer with no variation in gameplay other than the fact you have planes and boats now. One big long azz grind to get better parts for your vehicles.... which don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with it, I quite enjoy it actually... or at least I WOULD F*CKING ENJOY IT BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE THE AI IN THIS GAME DRIVES LIKE IT'S ON RAILS!!!! YOU'RE A BEAST AND IN THE LEAD YOU SAY?? DOESN'T MATTER....IF YOU EVEN BRAKE A GODD*MN MILLISECOND FROM THE OPTIMAL SPOT ON A TURN, ALL 7 DRIVERS PASS YOUR AZZ UP!!!!! LIKE WHAT KIND OF BULLSH*T IS THAT??? COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE F*CKIN PURPOSE OF UPGRADING YOUR VEHICLES IF THE COMPUTER DRIVES AS IF JESUS CHRIST IS BEHIND THE WHEEL.......  *Sigh* Okay I feel better now. And with that being said, I love the game, but I think Ubisoft/ Ivory Tower can do a little better, c'mon now. Especially since these same devs are apparently responsible for TDU, which imo blows this out of the water minus the graphics. That's sad. I mean graphically, sound-wise, and car handling.... this game is a big improvement over TC1, with the nice addition of planes, boats, and whatever else bullsh*t they may have thrown in there.... it's all fine and dandy, but the game feels empty... I'm not sure why they released a half azz game. But I don't give a f*ck, fix the AI - The End"

This review was framed after investing 30+ hours into the game and concluding the final rivalry races. The initial hours were so repulsive and full of meh impressions. But once you get a hold of a particular vehicle type and its handling, it’s all fun and excitement.[/i]  [h1][b] 📝Story/Plot:[/b][/h1] Just a generic plot setup to give your grind some motive and goal. A rookie entering the world of racing and guess what, some organizers see his potential and gave him a chance without even seeing him race beforehand. Just be #1 all around the events and conclude your journey after beating the top dogs who were the organizers too.  [h1][b]🎮Gameplay:[/b][/h1] [b]Initial impression-[/b] Imagine a hot girl with no personality. That’s the first 5-minute impression of The Crew 2. Starting off with high budget cinematics and performing short lap segment races while shifting to a new vehicle again and again. Sounds cool right? Wait until you see the whole f*cking world curve like in the movie Inception and Doctor Strange. At this point, my jaw was indisputably touching the ground. But just after completing a normal event race, it hit me with gloom and awkwardness. All that cinematic brag of “Speed is Life” and bla bla comes down to a slow race with the road looking like a low texture road. Like WTF?  [b]Mechanics/Controllability-[/b] I know it’s not a real sim racing game, nor advertised as a pure arcade. It’s unique on its own. But I feel like not giving it a category works as a bypass for some faulty mechanics. Cars feel slightly slow and weigh a ton on the controller. The purpose of a racing game is to acknowledge the speed atmosphere, which was only endured with top cars. Cars are not at all hard to control, rather easy and amusing. It’s the damn AI that makes all the races so tryhard. You are in lead for 97% of the race and suddenly an AI got a God’s hand and achieved supersonic speed. If you are thinking of bumping into them and play dirty, well have fun bumping a rubber band. All these aspects are blades of the same sword. AI feels difficult- what a tryhard game/Thank God it’s not cheap easy. Perspective matters here. I am not against it. Surely it’s sometimes annoying, but it iz what it iz.   It’s easy to understand how ground vehicles operate, steer, brake, drift, boost. But you are not familiar with aeroplane controls. Despite that, the first intro race makes you race an aeroplane. Instead of crossing checkpoints with my plane, I was crashing into enormous buildings and respawning. A terrible scenario that gets fixed in later event races where they teach you all aeroplane controls bit by bit.  [b]Open World-[/b] Take on the American motorsports scene as you explore across the entire USA. Being able to drive different vehicles like cars, bikes, boats and planes in the same open-world means not only you are free to drift your car on street roads, tread speedboat through the waterways but fly high across the sky too. Befitting pillars for the open-world statement. Now we know there are no restrictions, but what about interactables? Unfortunately, that’s a guessing game. Oh, I have a sharp turn incoming and I have to drift? Let’s do this then. You are halfway in your drift airmailing all those bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts in space, but suddenly you see a bench in between. That’s your stoppage. These randomly placed objects like benches or parked cars don’t follow Newton’s Law. They just wanna remain stationary no matter how hard you hit them. Trust me, these little objects ruined a lot of my lap times.  [b]Variety-[/b] You can use the astonishing top-notch live map, which single-handedly increases the game score by 2. Like how they even made it render the entire game in a 3D model just by a single click. Moving forward, the complete map contains various types of events/races you can take part in. Just for clarification, there are not AI vs races only. You can take part in a race against time, drifting, freestyling and a lot of car chases too. As I said, you are buying a complete package of the racing genre with multiple vehicle types. But there seems to be a hollow part of the story. During cinematics, you can easily see the top-quality work put together and the exciting race descriptions they narrate. But in reality, you won’t find those races in action. One cinematic had an image of a monster truck jumping out of a plane with a parachute, but there’s nothing present like that. They escalated the expectations through cinematic dialogues but disappointed us in the end. It’s not completely devastating as the default variety is already more than enough.  [b]PvP/Grinding-[/b] Sadly, you can’t run away from the “Look, there’s a level 1 guy with lvl99 car” scenario. It’s Ubisoft, which means expect a lot of transactions. Buy bundles, buy a season pass (Motorpass), or add in-game currency and get any high-speed car you want, but if you don’t wanna spend a penny, good luck grinding your a*s out. Be a part of a crew and evade the boredom of grinding alone.  [h1][b]📷Graphics:[/b][/h1] Enjoy a pizza full of delicious and uplifting toppings added on a half-cooked bread base. Now all your bites will have a random taste. Some will please your tastebuds, and some will taste like cardboard. The object detailing in the open world is great, but their textures, Oh Lord. Never expected to witness those low texture brick buildings from a 2018 game. Like, come on; all the vehicles, roadside objects, even dirt tracks look so good. Then why the buildings and gravel roads look like a dusty mirror. To avoid these bad graphic races, I played air and water races the most.  [h1][b]📝Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]  [b]Pros-[/b] [list]     [*]Big Open-world.     [*]Character and vehicle customization.     [*]Good chunk of playable time.      [*]Multiple vehicle types.     [*]Varied races and challenges.     [*]Offline or Online races. [/list]  [b]Cons-[/b] [list]     [*]Grind vs PayToWin is real.     [*]Semi cooked graphics.     [*]Annoying indestructible objects.     [*]No dynamic weather in the open world. [/list]  [h1][b]🏷️Tips to new players:[/b][/h1] Keep in mind, you can drift your plane. Without this, you are going to kiss the land whenever you take a flight. Don’t start PvP races until you reach at least the Famous rank. There are no restrictions on which racetrack to follow. So cut the track however you want. The first one to cross the checkpoint is the winner. Change resolution to borderless. Otherwise, whenever you will Alt+Tab, the game will start re-syncing, which wastes 4-10 seconds of your life every time.  [h1][b]😇Honest Rating:[/b][/h1] If you are looking for that NFS arcade or real sim racing like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, then just buy them instead. It’s nowhere perfect or overly marvellous. But I can assure you, if you invest enough hours into the game, you will adore it even as toxic relation. Only buy on big sale!  Rating: 8/10 Best world bending I ever saw."
88527600,english,1,646910,I played Forza Horizon (3 and 4) before playing The Crew 2 and it (the crew) disappointed me. Is more like an arcade game and for me is boring. I prefer Forza. I am not saying that is not a good game but I had higher expectations.
88608887,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2 is one of my all-time favorite racing games, mostly because of all the freedom the player has. I'm not like the average car fan, in racing games I usually like to see how crazy I can make a car look instead of customizing it as if it was a real world vehicle, and the crew 2 is the perfect game for players like me. The customization is amazing, there are dozens and dozens of different parts for each of the nearing 400 vehicles, including a livery creating system to make and share skins with the community. The Crew 2 also has a big variety of vehicles, including my favorite, the DMC DeLorean (though I hope sometime soon they'll add tesla vehicles to the game!). The map is also extremely large, with amazing graphics, especially lighting. The tracks/courses are fun and creative, although some can be annoying at times. Overall, I give The Crew 2 5 stars, and I would recommend the game to any racing fan."
164128496,english,0,646910,"Doesn't matter how good this game is if it just gets taken away from you whenever they decide they've taken enough money off of you. As a longtime player of The Crew games and a lover of The Crew 2, do not buy this game. Pirate this $hit instead. Ubisoft CEO said players should be ""comfortable with not owning"" their games. Start by not owning this one."
43749472,english,0,646910,"WARNING, DO NOT BUY DELUXE EDITION!!! I bought this game either launch day or the day after (Deluxe Edition) and here we are nearly a month later an I have not recieved either of the 2 vehicles in the Legendary Vehicles Pack, they were locked under ""Early Access"" and can now be purchased by everyone, problem is I have already paid an extra $20 dollars for them. Support is un-responsive and my issue has been ignored totally in the forums, so what did I end up with? I ended up with an $80 dollar base game. so BUYER BEWARE, get the regular version or the gold, deluxe is complete rip off."
81510860,english,0,646910,"In short, Great concept, ((STUPID)) expensive on top of also Micro-transactions GALORE!!!    In detail: The concept of this game is great! The map size (Friggin huge), multiple motorsports, and the amount of multiplayer potential is amazing! There is however a pretty BIG issue with the current way the game is going. Its following the same downward spiral a lot of other games are doing. ""premium currency"" and the so-called ""battlepass"" (Litterally worded as ""motorpass"" in this game.)   Now im not bashing on the battlepass idea entirely. if this game was free-to-play with DLC's i could understand...however this game costs a gross amount of money and it still feels like a ""free-to-play"" game. they have these ""Crew Credits"" (CC) that USED to be obtained via contracts. however now they are only obtained through this ""battlepass"" in order to be able to get EVERYTHING from the motorpass, it will cost ya 80k CC. You get 20k for free from the pass and an additional 20k if ya bought the premium motorpass. Furthermore most of the content of the game is locked behind this paywall. I'm sorry but if i pay $90 for a game, i wanna be able to play ALL of it. (Forza Horizon series did it right in my opinion.) Lots of cars to drive? yup but if ya want them all...gotta get through the paywall. Hey want a cool police lightbar? We got ya covered! Just spend 80k CC and grind your hind end off every day and maybe get almost to the END of the ""motorpass"" and you can have it right before ya get burnt out on the game!   Players are leaving the game because of this stuff and i feel like the devs are thinking ""Game is dying? welp time to milk every last dime out of the remaining players till it dies! Then we will work on ANOTHER game and when it dies, we will do it AGAIN!"" This isn't a game made truely for players, it a game made just for profit.  PS. Just bought some crew credits for my sis on her account with my card, Money is gone, Crew Credits not there. They are more than money monsters, they are scammers! Also, funny how i cant find a phone number for the ubisoft support. Guess ill have to have a conversation with a robot"
60802811,english,1,646910,"Let me get right to the point. I would not recommend this game if you're looking for a good racing game. I would not recommend this game if you are all about graphics. I would not recommend this game if you like any sort of story line.           I would recommend this game highly, higher than any other game if you're looking for something you can just listen to your chill playlist, cruise, and maybe even get boofed ;). I purchased this game last year (base game) for full price, I think I put maybe $10 into it after that to get a nice drift car, then I realized the games racing is shit.           So now I only play the game to go cruise the US and just relax and waste time. Nothing like coming home from work, heating up the rig and downing a glob, then just chilling driving around."
70528009,english,0,646910,"5/10 - Lots to like, but lots to hate. Could have been so much more. Full review below:  = Intro =  Sometimes, I'm in the mood for a racer. I fondly remember the days of NFSU 2, Gran Turismo on the PS and Most Wanted, games that not only lasted me weeks, but gave me new bands to listen to and endless replay value. Had this on my 'to play' list so got around to it. Enjoyed Forza, but it felt a bit flat and I wanted something with a bit more progression.  = Gameplay =  This is a racing game. Vrooom, cars go fast. But it's also a watersports game. And an offroad game. And a rally game. And a flying stunts game. And a flying racer game. And another dozen types of racing/stunt game rolled into one. Oh and also a loot game. You can see the problem immediately.  That said, man - this game does try. And sometimes gets it right. The water racing is immensely fun. Rally racing is great. Motorcross is mostly a blast. The absolute apex of the game for me are the lengthy 'runs' - massive races between cities, that lead you through towns, cities, mountains, forests etc. Glorious.  The weakest part of the game for me has to be the street racing, which isn't the nice, varied, speedy tracks you are likely expecting, but rather boxy, twisty monstrosities filled with right-angle turns. Right off the bat, these were frustrating as heck and some of the later ones will make you want to eat a kitten.  This has to do with the fact that a lot of cars handle like shopping carts and the more expensive ones handle like shopping carts with a jet booster. This game works best with long, open tracks, which sadly are lacking in a lot of styles.  Beyond this, every 'discipline' has it's own set of vehicles and loot. Welcome to the grind overdrive. And this is made worse by the fact that the sheer number of event types means that many only get a handful of races, total.  However the kicker is the AI. It...cheats. Rubberbanding is utterly crazy, especially when you start doing higher difficulty races - but unlike other games, it's only applied to give the AI an advantage. If you fail to drive perfectly on some tracks, the AI will soar past you instantly. Or it may just randomly do that anyway.  However once the AI is ahead, it just keeps on going. This is especially evident in the set-vehicle races where you and the AI have (allegedly) the same vehicles and specs. However, on Ace, you can enjoy the sight of the AI flying into the distance right from the get go, waving and flipping the bird.  This leads to a lot of styles being not only about driving prowess but luck, and finding ways to break the game. Weird, unmarked shortcuts, odd physics and the like. Sigh.  All of that said though, I don't hate this game. When it works, it works like gangbusters. Maybe if they had removed the boring flying stuff and produced double the races for existing styles, this could have been a winner.  = Graphics and Audio =  Visually, this game is a mixed bag. Water is lovely. Weather is beautiful. Lighting can be stunning. But textures are meh and ...wow, do cities look awful. Especially at daytime. Framerates are perfect.  Audio, rather than the mix of metal, rock, punk, rap and EDM you may be expecting is instead a small collection of the blandest EDM known to man.   = Style =  As I've said - too cluttered, too thinly spread.  And the interface/design is a nightmare. Let's say you do a race a few times, restarting immediately after you finish. Your loot goes to the mailbox. You then need to leave the race (loading time), go to a racing base (loading time), walk around, get the mail, exit the base (loading time), go to your home (loading time), walk up to your vehicle stand, change your vehicle (loading time) and then upgrade it.  Welcome to busywork.  But the absolute worst thing for me was discovering, after returning to the game after a long period, that there was no way to reset progress, whatsoever. Meaning if you experiment early and foul things up, there is no way to ever remedy it.  = Value =  To be fair, there is a lot here for the price, especially if you get this game on it's frequent, really good specials.  There are microtransactions, but most of the stuff can be earned in-game. However there is also stuff that can't. And I'm sick of microtransactions in AAA priced games.  = Overall =  + Many events are insanely fun + Original and well implemented loot system + 'Run' races are just awesome  - Impossible to ever reset progress/start a new game - Insanely cheaty AI - Frustrating street racing - Awful interface - Open world feels meaningless - Spread way too thin - Ubisoft style microtransactions  At the end of the day, this is a game I really want to like. With a bit more focus, less insane design decisions and some better/more interesting tracks, this could have been amazing. As it is...it's both enjoyable enough to keep me playing and flawed enough to make this hard to recommend."

135628343,english,1,646910,"[h1] This game is simply amazing! [/h1] The graphics are great. There is a [b] ton [/b] of content. Great progression too, you are always advancing, but little by little, making for interesting game play over time. It is definitely worth its standard 50$ price tag but I bought it when it was on sale for 10$.  Thank you for reading my review!"
180604033,english,1,646910,"Many people say that this game is bad, assuming that it is because of the horrible graphics you will always notice. Personally, this is one of the games that I would recommend to give some time to spend on because it is fun and the player has freedom to cruise around and do numerous activities whether you play by yourself or with a built crew.  With the ability to switch to another vehicle whether air or water while driving, you get to realize that there are so many things that this game offers. For me, this is an awesome game, though the sole issue I have with this game is that it is only playable ONLINE. I wish there is a feature where in you can drive around and participate in races even without the online feature or just disabled online mode. In addition to the free-roaming, there are races that provide the player a huge drop of cash and with the ability to increase the number of drop of car parts and money by progressing your ICON stats, you are guaranteed wealthy enough to purchase numerous vehicles of different disciplines that are so many that I am speechless of this game and how amazing it is.  To conclude. The Crew 2 is fun. Surely some will say the graphic renditions, especially buildings and environments have awful sight to it, but still, with all honesty, this is a fun game to play. If you purchased the Gold Edition, you will receive free, if I am not mistaken, 22 vehicles for free and few exclusive vehicles that you can get for free."
62437027,english,1,646910,"This game has received a lot of hate. Personally, I believe a lot of the hate it undeserved, but they can make some good points.  Starting with the pros: - Vehicle variety and detail. This game has over 300 different vehicles, and personally I believe the detail on the vehicles is out standing, even things as small as bolts for some extended fenders:   10/10  - Vehicle Customisation. Almost all of the vehicles have a wide range of changeable parts. There are many options to choose from in an easy to navigate menu, as well as bonus items that can be rewarded from playing the game by doing daily missions giving you a currency to buy special items such as under glow, custom wheels, tire smoke and more.         9/10  - The Map Size. The map size is where this game stands out above all. In a fast car (280Mph top speed+) with good driving it took me over an hour to travel from the southeast tip to the north west tip. In this map you will find several cities and other land marks along the way, also encountering the occasional player along your journey. The details in the cities are spectacular and the amount of places to go are countless.     10/10  - Multiplayer. The game puts you into a public lobby filled with usually around 3 to 8 other players, communicating with a custom chat menu which prevents and toxicity or bullying. When you want to play alone you can but on the other hand if you are looking to go on a road trip with a friend or do some races with a pal this game has made an easy system for you to do so.       8/10  - Race Variety. Currently in the game there and 16 different Motorsports events to choose from:       -Street Race, Drift, Drag race, Hyper car       -Motor cross, Hovercraft, Rally cross ( off-road ), Rally raid       -Freestyle ( Stunt planes), jet sprint ( Small boat racing ), demo derby, Monster truck       -Touring car, F1, Boat racing, Air race Along with these you get different skill based activities like Speed-traps and escapes ( furthest distance in a period of time ) as well as Photo ops of landmarks or player scenarios.          10/10  - The Summit. Every week, there is a series of events that you can do competing against other players in order to win prices such as followers, parts or occasionally, cars. This feature gives a deep purpose to this game, and for me a feeling like i need and want to come back to do those races and get those prizes. 10/10  Smaller mentions: -Unlimited garage space -Customisable car settings and parts -As you level up, you will receive rewards at certain milestones ( Cars planes boats etc )   And now the Cons:  -Graphics. This game can look beautiful, however a lot of the places feel empty or dull, like they need something extra. Also, the shading was poorly made, with a lot of colours looking flat. Like I said, certain places look fantastic and are very photogenic, however the textures aren't HD and could have more colour. With a simple graphics remake this game could easily be level with GTA V or FH4.     3.5/10  -Sound. Some of the car sounds are well executed, but for the most part they seem dull and like they could be more intense. The vehicles that do sound good are incredible, however a lot of cars that seem powerful get underwhelmed by the sounds coming from the engine.  4/10  -Weather. Now when i say weather I need to make it VERY clear i mean the weather changing, not the visuals. In my opinion, the rain in this game falls just short of GTA V rain puddles in the city at night, but with this game you can be in sunny weather, you go into settings to maybe turn your sound down a little and when you are out of the menu, boom: Thick snow. Even when it changes visibly to the player, it is too fast and too frequent. 5/10  -The Voices. Oh my lord turn off voices and turn on subtitles because the majority of the voices in this game are infuriating and get super annoying super quick.     1.5/10  -The prices. The vehicle prices can be realistic and occasionally generous, with a Buggati Chiron costing 2.4 million, but then when you venture over to the low end of the spectrum like bikes, you start to see prices like 500 grand for a sports bike. It isn't accurate. Another thing to mention is the grind for money. The money received after a race needs to increase, as grinding mindlessly for 3 hours in order to save up 2.4 million like I have done gets quite frustrating, and whilst it normally pays off, the pain you feel inside when you know the only way to get yourself that money you need for your next car is going to take 100 races of the same race is discomforting and off-putting.  Important note: i see a lot of people talking about rubber banding and i need to say i have never experienced this. I often finish races 10-30 seconds ahead when i use my super fast vehicles, and on other races like the 40 minute race it is often minutes ahead. If there was rubber banding, how could the times they are behind me be so large?  To summarise, I am saying this game is worth it, but keep it in your wishlist until it is on a sale to make up for the cons you may experience in this game.  Peace.    Side note to any active players: Anyone down to do some races together? DM me."
171979040,english,1,646910,"The Crew 2, a game where you can switch from driving a hypercar to piloting a plane faster than you can say ""Did I just clip that skyscraper?""  The game’s map is a condensed version of the USA, which means you can drive from New York to Los Angeles in about 30 minutes. Take that, real-world traffic!  Switching between vehicles is as simple as pressing a button. One moment you're cruising down the streets of Miami, and the next, you're free-falling from the sky because you accidentally transformed into a boat mid-air. Pro tip: boats don't fly.  The variety of races is vast, and so are the number of trees I've crashed into while attempting to pull off that ""totally planned"" drift. And let's not forget the photo mode challenges. Nothing says ""professional photographer"" like trying to snap a pic of a flamingo while barrel-rolling in a jet.  In conclusion, the game is pretty fun, sure the handling physics aren't anything like NFS of Forza, but the game has its charms."
174694396,english,0,646910,"[h1] Stop Destroying Videogames [/h1]  [b]  European Citizens' Initiative :  Video games have grown into an industry with billions of customers worth hundreds of billions of euros. During this time, a specific business practice in the industry has been slowly emerging that is not only an assault on basic consumer rights but is destroying the medium itself.  An increasing number of publishers are selling video games that are required to connect through the internet to the game publisher, or ""phone home"" to function. While this is not a problem in itself, when support ends for these types of games, very often publishers simply sever the connection necessary for the game to function, proceed to destroy all working copies of the game, and implement extensive measures to prevent the customer from repairing the game in any way.  This practice is effectively robbing customers of their purchases and makes restoration impossible. Besides being an affront on consumer rights, video games themselves are unique creative works. Like film, or music, one cannot be simply substituted with another. By destroying them, it represents a creative loss for everyone involved and erases history in ways not possible in other mediums.  Existing laws and consumer agencies are ill-prepared to protect customers against this practice. The ability for a company to destroy an item it has already sold to the customer long after the fact is not something that normally occurs in other industries. With license agreements required to simply run the game, many existing consumer protections are circumvented. This practice challenges the concept of ownership itself, where the customer is left with nothing after ""buying"" a game.     We wish to invoke Article 17 §1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [EUR-Lex - 12012P/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] – “No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss.” – This practice deprives European citizens of their property by making it so that they lose access to their product an indeterminate/arbitrary amount of time after the point of sale. We wish to see this remedied, at the core of this Initiative.   We also invoke Title XV of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)[EUR-Lex - 12012E/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] and the following TFEU Articles as our justification for and the Union’s imperative to respond to this initiative:  Article 169 – Per §1, the EU has an obligation “to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection…to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers”. We believe this practice infringes upon or requires correction to be commensurate with the EU’s obligation. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with videogames.    Article 12 – “Consumer protection requirements shall be taken into account in defining and implementing other Union policies and activities.” Given that this practice extends across Member States and beyond the EU, the Union’s actions regarding this practice ought to keep consumer protection in mind. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with video games.  Article 114, §3 – “The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection… Within their respective powers, the European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective” This practice undermines the high level of consumer protection that the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council takes as the basis of law in the Union, and their objectives of establishing and maintaining the functioning of an internal market as described in §1 of this Article, and Article 26 TFEU.[/b]  [h1] THE CREW 2 IS NEXT!

94458352,english,1,646910,"Easily one of the best arcade racing games out there. Most of the critics are by the people who either judged the game by playing just a couple of hours or those comparing it with other racing/driving games. Here's my take on its pros and cons:  PROS:  1. Map: Insanely huge map of the USA. Has almost all the visiting sites you can think of. It'd take you half an hour to drive from NY to San Francisco. You can never get bored of the map, period.  2. Car collection: Huge car collection from all the popular makes. They keep adding more every week and with every new update. Same with boats, planes, etc. You can actually buy like 98% of the cars without paying actual money. You might need some grinding though. 'New York' or the 'Uber dam' are good events to grind.  3. Car customization: You can customize almost everything from car color to tires, rims, wings, body kits, smokes, nitros, windows, even the underglows. There's also a good, active community that keeps adding custom liveries (skins/vinyls) which you can apply to your cars directly. And of course, there's a decent liverly editor too.  4. Race tracks: Challenging and fun race tracks. Some even have good shortcuts which you can master by driving repeatedly. You may try to break some of the world records.  5. Diversity: Various disciplines to choose from. You ever get bored from the street races, you can do boat race, jet race, air race, motorbike race, monster trucks, you name it. Although the game has good diversity, it's biased towards street races due to the number of events available in it compared to other disciplines. But then, if you're a street racing fan, that's what you want.  6. Regular content update: Really impressed with the 'Live Summit' weekly events with unique themes. You compete with other players to get the prizes. Prizes being special edition cars, tires, car parts, nitros, followers, etc.  CONS:  1. Graphics: Being a 2018 game, the graphics could've been better. You can't expect amazing graphics for such a giant map but the textures and reflections could still be better (as they're reused a lot). The lightings/weather system is good during the day with bright sunlight but it looks like a water painting when cloudy or rainy. The nights are okay at best.  2. Unbalanced AI: The AI in the game is somewhat unbalanced. I mean you can easily win street races or hypercars in Ace (highest difficulty) with a decent, well-upgraded car. Like a Buggati Divo or La Voiture Noire. But then you'll sweat to finish even the 'Easy' drag races without grinding.  3. Physics: Funny. If you're looking for a racing game with realistic or good physics, this isn't the one. They've surely made the car handling better with each update, but it still hurts to see a hypercar wobble at 400+ kmph with slight curves.  4. Optimization: I'm not sure how it scored 7/10 on GameDebate for optimization. I have a good GPU. Though it runs smooth most of the time, a crowded street race or a multiplayer with varied ping rates would cause immediate lags. Sometimes even kick players out. Even the processor and the GPU runs hotter during the gameplay as compared to other games of the same scale.  5. PvP: There's no customizability for PvP races. Also, the PvP player base is low and often results in a long waiting time.  If you're a racing freak who loves arcade and don't mind a bit of a funny physics, go get it. You won't regret. If you're into simulators and graphics, stay away. I've been a Forza fan myself (have a good amount of hours spent on the windows store version), but this game is still very fun in what it offers."
93303443,english,1,646910,Three steps to slowly but surely climbing up the racing leaderboards in the Crew 2: 1. Grind for better parts (Loot) 2. Grind money (to re-roll affixes) 3. Grind for followers (maximal perks)  The Crew 2 is a racing RPG at its best!
119911539,english,1,646910,"I ignored this game for many years because I thought every single event involved a mix of cars, boats, and flying. Oh no, I was very wrong.  Had a lot of fun with this one. I bought the base game on sale for 10 bucks. The season pass isn't necessary as it just adds more cars and a slight discount in the game store, but you don't need it, you just gotta play and earn stuff that way which to me is more fun.   I'm really glad there's actually characters and narratives that kept me interested. A lot of racing games are just go here, do the race, go to the next one, etc etc. But here the story, leveling up, loot and characters made it feel like I was aiming for a goal.   There's a TON of stuff to do. Street racing, hyper car racing, drag, drift, power boats, air races,  rallycross, hovercraft, motocross, touring, demolition derby, and MONSTER TRUCKS!!!! Those were my favorite. It's all arcadey feeling, so you can turn your car in mid air and stuff like that. There's also HUGE JUMPS which are so much fun. Plus there's loads of side activities like taking photos of landmarks, animals, stunts, etc, and escape missions, speed traps to name a few. Not to mention weekly events (called Live Summit) that have leaderboards and rewards are based on how many points you rack up against other players.   On top of all that there's these really cool movie like scenarios called Motorflix where you have to either do events for movies, or smash vehicles like youre in Burnout 3. AND there's treasure map type missions where you get clues and have to find the specific area and take a picture, which when all are completed you'll get a nice reward. All of it is completely optional. You don't have to do every single event in any section to progress. I jumped around a lot. When I got tired of races, I'd jump into some drag races, monster trucks, photo ops, live summit or the motorflix. Just whatever you wanna do.  Speaking of rewards, this game gives them out nicely. Not just cars either. You can get parts, cool visual stuff like neon underglows or colored tire smoke or nitro colors. It's basically a dopamine simulator.   Got all the achievements, completed the live extreme series and did over 70% of street racing, offroad, freestyle, and pro racing events. I also did all three seasons of motorflix and part of season six. There's still a ton of stuff left to do if I wanted as well.  The only stuff I didn't like was that since you can fast travel to any event, there isn't much reason to drive around the world. Kinda wish they would take a Forza Horizon approach and have billboards and fast travel boards scattered around to encourage this, but the way the whole game is set up is still really fun. I wish the game had more steam achievements too since there's so many things to do and unlock in game. Kinda surprised they had em in the first place considering it's a Ubisoft game. But the worst part is it's online all the time, which means when Ubi shuts down the servers the game will be dead, probably. So it's possible the game has an expiration date, unless they let people play it single player.   And let me point out that while the game is called The Crew 2, I basically played almost the entire game by myself. I joined a crew for a little bit and did some stuff, but then I guess I got kicked out but all of my progress was still there so no big deal."
173366642,english,0,646910,"I can't express how deeply unsatisfying the non-physics-based driving feels; it's worse than a cheap arcade motorcycle game. Furthermore, online required (see what happened to The Crew 1), terrible, LONG, extremely frequent cut-scenes, very poor UI decisions (I couldn't even figure out how to exit the game!), FPS and resolution limited, a mandatory anti-cheat driver, and mediocre graphics means that there are far better games out there. The only reason I can see to purchase this game is for its boat racing, but even then, it's boring, in my opinion.  I don't really understand the positive reviews given how terrible driving feels to be honest."
169260250,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 doesn't work on the Steam Deck because Ubisoft refuses to support it. They could flip a switch and allow Linux compatibility with the anti-cheat, they just don't want to.  Plus we now know that paying for this game does not equal owning the game. Ubisoft owns the game and they will take away your access whenever they feel like it, just like they did with the original.  They don't respect Steam Deck customers but that shouldn't be a surprise because they've shown through their actions that they don't respect any of their customers."
68680690,english,1,646910,"Put some music on, grab your favorite car, and just drive.  Edit: Forza Horizon 4 is now on steam, this game is still ok but Forza is WAY better at the same concept. don't buy this, buy Forza."
48440230,english,0,646910,"The Crew 2 has got the potential for a good arcade racing game. Unfortunately it's not.   While the graphics look nice and the cars offer very good feedback, the whole setting sucks. The story makes you want to turn of your PC as soon as those ai smart asses, you have to team up with, start talking. Their constant advice makes you want to throw up, run away or punch them in the face. And they keep talking all the time.  Of course you're a rookie driving your way up to stardom by collecting followers. The dream of every six year old.  And of course your path to the top is riddled with obstacles. At least that's something Ubisoft really does well. Especially when this concept forces players to pay real money to overcome the hindrances.  Your main hindrance are cars because you ain't got none. Or should I say almost none. The standard version of The Crew 2 gives you a slow street car, a slow plane and a slow boat. At least this allows you to play some races.   You need to win races to gain followers. Ending games in first, second or third position also grants you upgrades for your vehicle.  Additionally you earn in-game money. In-game money is needed to buy new cars, planes or boats. And that's exactly where Ubisofts sales department steps in. In order to shorten the tedious task of endlessly driving races to win the money necessary to buy cars for different events or higher racing classes, you can simply buy in-game money with real money.   You can also buy the season pass which grants you two new cars every month for one year and an in-game discount when buying new cars. Of course the season pass costs real money.  You also need the best cars in order to compete with other players in multi-player mode. It will take you a lot of racing time winning the necessary in-game money to buy the cars needed to beat the competition. And you also need to upgrade the cars.  No matter what type of car you buy, you always receive the standard edition. So you need to drive races with this car to add upgrades.   There's a lot of work to get the cars you need. And Ubisoft made sure that there are many different vehicles you need.  - Street Race - Drift - Drag Race - Hyper Car - Rally Raid - Moto Cross - Rally Cross - Aerobatics - Jetsprint - Monster Truck - Powerboat - Touring Car - Air Race - Alpha GP  In order to stand a chance in multi-player mode you need to learn the tracks including all shortcuts. Thankfully the multi-player tracks are the same as the single-player races. This gives you the chance to train and memorize routes.  Contrary to The Crew 1 the USA is no longer the star of the game. Although graphics have improved, villages and cities look exchangeable. The unique atmosphere of Chicago, New York, San Francisco or Miami is no longer perceptible in The Crew 2. Even the countryside sometimes looks artificial. Not everywhere, but in some places.   At some locations it seems as if the developers didn't finish designing the landscape. There are areas where bushes and trees seem to be missing and hills are bald.  Free riding is no longer fun. That's because other cars drive closer together. The Crew 1 allowed you to race top speed in the middle of the highway passing cars on both sides. Try that in The Crew 2 and you will constantly crash.  You often find places where the game tells you to take a photo. You'll get an achievement once you took 40 photos in unique places. If you tell the game to mark the spot for the photo nothing is marked. You'll start searching but don't know where to go. There's no mark at all and neither navigation not mini-map can guide you. Then you take a photo and still have 40 photos left to take.  The same applies for extra upgrades. Extra upgrades are scattered all over the US. Once you move close to an upgrade your navigation system starts blinking and pinging. But if you search for the upgrade it's nowhere to be found. At least I can't find them. In 20 hours play time I found a single upgrade. It was a huge shining blue box on a field, twice as big as my car and it could not be missed. But whenever I search for them in a city they are nowhere to be found. Not sure if it's me but it's frustrating. I think it's bugged or again unfinished development.  I could continue listing disadvantages but I guess you get the idea. Steam only allows 8000 words per review and I had to shorten this one.  The Crew 2 is a mess and the games only purpose is to pull money out of your pockets. I assume Ubisoft forced the developers to design the game this way. Market target are kids and youngsters that are likely to pay for better cars. Make it colorful, rise their self-esteem by increasing their number of followers and make them feel important.  Is there something good? Yes.  The developers managed to make drifting very enjoyable and very well controllable, given you picked the right car. I found the Ford Mustang GT Fastback to offer fantastic drift control.  All cars feel different and every car behaves very unique. That's a point the developers really did well. Feedback from cars is great and you can really feel if you're driving a limousine, a muscle car or a beach buggy.  Pros: - beautiful graphics - many races - very good feedback from cars - all cars feel unique - driving in general is fun - very good car engine sounds - you can fine tune your cars in very many ways (if you find the settings) - all cars, boats and planes can be test driven (for one or two minutes) - some upgrades offer special bonuses - photo mode, including filters  Cons: - extremely annoying story and ai team partners - ...that keep talking annoying bullshit and treat you like a child - cities feel artificial and static even if they look beautiful - only random car upgrades - very buggy - even crashes sometimes - distant traffic very often vanishes if you move closer - feels unfinished - every race has an introduction where you have to drive to the start line and some idiot gives annoying advice or talks about other very infuriating nonsense - ...and it happens every time you re-start the race - tries hard to make you pay real money - the game even sells clothes for your avatar - vehicles are very expensive making it an endless grind to buy a hyper-car - limited fun - often hard to find players in multi-player although the game is not that old - multiplayer races are far less fun than in The Crew 1 - free ride is far less fun than in The Crew 1 and often very annoying - zoomed out map of USA is simply black and white and looks far worse than in The Crew 1 - cumbersome, annoying menu navigation - not a single good song on the in-game radio stations. Seriously - not one. Not even in classic. - emphasis on single-player - long start time - no cops - cars given to season pass owners can not be purchased by none season pass owners - even some T-Shirts for your avatar can only be bought by season pass owners - boat races are difficult because you loose a lot of speed when you jump over ramps while the ai somehow doesn't - rubber-band ai - annoying photo challenges - ...and a lot of annoying other challenges - the game does not grant you upgrades or money if you win in a higher difficulty but your car does not have the necessary upgrade class. Even if you actually did win! WTF?! - all player characters are ugly and can't be changed once you picked yours - you only get loot in races if you win - no reason to explore the map independently (unlike in The Crew 1) - drag races are still extremely boring - plane acrobatics are even more boring - monster trucks and hovercrafts are totally unnecessary - I couldn't figure out how to instantly switch between cars, planes and boats - I couldn't figure out how to join a crew"

So despite that the game runs great and smoothly, the launcher doesn't. Making new friends is impossible and inviting old ones to play with you together is impossible, too. Ubisoft needs to have a serious talk with their developer team:  https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/138532/createdxgifactory2-could-not-be-located-in-the-dynamic-link-library-dxgi-dll/41?page=3&lang=en-US  EDIT: October 2022:  https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/138532/createdxgifactory2-could-not-be-located-in-the-dynamic-link-library-dxgi-dll-windows-7-no-longer-supported/262?lang=en-US  Ubisoft broke their launcher ""Ubisoft Connect"" so their games will NOT launch on Windows 7, which is in their requirements.

68199299,english,0,646910,"If this game goes on sale for $15 and you have nothing else to play I could recommend this game. The sad part is, this is a good game. It's a lot of fun. But the reason I can't recommend it is because the PVP is completely fucked. The Live Summit is the only way to get exclusive vehicles, but good luck ranking high enough in the live summit to score one of those exclusive vehicles. If you check the leaderboards, its blatantly obvious that the top players (whom you have to compete against in order to win the exclusive rewards) are exploiting. You can literally watch their ghost use these exploits to achieve a higher score, meaning the only way for you to beat them and unlock exclusive vehicles is to take all the fun out of the game and use the exploit yourself. If you just want to play solo, or with friends, I can recommend this game because the driving is fun and the graphics are great. However as a fan of PVP and racing games, I can't recommend this game until the dev team decides to do something about all of the exploiting players that rule the leaderboards. They need to either remove the exploits and wipe the leaderboards, or make it so that you can unlock every vehicle in the game without participating in the live summits. Either fix the PVP, or give us a way to work around it and still enjoy the game."
160183351,english,1,646910,"This is better than Motofest. Screw you Ubisoft.

154144034,english,0,646910,"Games sold as Single Player titles should have offline capabilities. They should not have Always Online features. It is appalling how disconnected the companies are from their clientele.  As long as the product is sold and non-refundable, they are good. If the patch doesn't come out for the game that is being taken down just because Online features and upkeep of the servers are not feasible things for the company, it will clearly show there the interest lies.   People get it, keeping up with server payments and infrastructure is costly and doesn't get cheaper, but if you pull a license from paying customers just like that, I really hope people will take notice and never buy anything from them going forward.   I won't, and will do my best to advise everyone I can to steer clear from companies like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.   And I really do hope companies that feel that it's an okay thing to do to their customers will implode and close up shop. It would suck for talented people who work on good games, but they are not the ones that profit from their own creations.  Edit: If anything, it would be somewhat of a fun time to pirate games of the said company to enjoy them for free. And without the constant worry that the library I've spent money on will go AWOL because some asshole in a suit made a call. I'm more than happy to pay for games I play, but the sad reality we all worried about for about a decade and a half start to creep in - If it's not Physical, don't buy it. I'm sure there will be more and more precedents like this and the big companies will hide behind ""anti-piracy drm"" argument with their Always Online bullshit as well.

177818626,english,1,646910,"I'd say this game is worth a try. There’s plenty of racing, though it’s kind of like the towers in Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry—you’re constantly grinding for something.  About that grind: collecting tuning parts (to get bonuses, you need to put together a full set of the same color and type) can be a hassle. Don’t expect to complete a set easily—you’ll likely be replaying the same race multiple times. There are around 200 races in total, each with three difficulty levels. I’ve cleared 88% of the main races and about 51% of the three other categories, and I’m nowhere near completing a full set on any car. But honestly, you don't need a full set. Once you max out your car’s power, you can just blow past the AI ​​opponents and enjoy the view.  And the views here are worth it. The game is gorgeous, and the scale is impressive. You truly feel like you’re driving across an entire country. The map might even be bigger than Euro Truck Simulator's, even with all the DLC. Each state has its own distinct look and vibe, and I loved the variety.  The one downside is that the game kind of forces you to try different modes. I wasn’t really into planes or Off-Road, though the boat races were surprisingly fun. Some modes just feel pointless, like Derby. It’s just cars bouncing around with no real destruction physics. And F1 racing doesn’t really fit either—the arcade physics don’t do it justice, and when you’re driving an F1 car off-road, it’s just weird.  At first, I hated Off-Road races and was ready to skip them. I tried MX, Aerobatics, and Touring Car instead, but that sense of “incomplete” pushed me to finish those 20 Off-Road races, unlock the boss, and complete all the achievements.  Overall, the game’s pretty easy—maybe too easy. To make it more challenging, you’d have to clear everything on the easiest difficulty first, and with a game this big, that can get tiring. I put in 30 hours and only got through half the game. I really enjoyed the hypercars, though; I’d be down for even more long races that last an hour or more. There’s something special about speeding down a wide-open highway, listening to music, and soaking up the graphics.  In short, there’s something for everyone here, so I’d say it’s worth a thumbs-up."

SUPER disappointed in this game. This isn't even worth $60 it's definitely a $20 game or less. Honestly a low effort trash money grab.  Ironically there was a warning at the beggining of the open beta menu, where it said that it was a beta and that it doesn't represent the full game, NOPE, that beta literally showed everything the full game had to offer.

176423165,english,1,646910,"Ubisoft is undeniably awful and I hold no love for them, but this ended up possibly being the best dollar I ever spent. I got it originally because the discount was just too much to pass up but didn't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as I have and will continue to do. This title made me realize I love racing games.   I don't know how deep any of the activities are compared to the competition in the genre but it's pure good fun. There's lots of variety in event types and tons of vehicles with impressive customization. The drawbacks are that the characters are insufferable, just about every line of dialog is cringe inducing and the voice acting is wretchedly bad — but fortunately none of that matters in a game like this. Maybe that's a plus if you can laugh at it, but for me skipping just about all of it is mandatory.   Just turn up the music and drive! Or fly! Or sail."

There are too many I can criticise about this game: terrible car selection in the menu, terrible handling and driving feedback, lacking of vehicle trade or hiding, and the worst is demolition derby. However there are many good about this game as well: large map and beautiful landscape, nice weather system and the best is the diversity of vehicles. Overall this game deserves a thumb up, Ubisoft is not. Now I think it's time to bring Vivendi back and put some pressure to Ubi."
53422750,english,1,646910,"Given my opinions and thoughts on its predecessor, I never thought I would've liked The Crew 2, let alone recommend it. But here I am. It's not a 100% recommendation, the game sure does have its flaws but for the price I paid during this sale, it's well worth it and deserves praise. And considering how much this game tries to get as close as possible to its competitor Forza Horizon, a comparison between the two games is as natural as it is mandatory. Let's examine its strengths:  Map: it's HUGE. I really mean it. It's huge unlike any other map you have seen in any other racing game. Looking at Forza Horizon's maps makes them look like they're the size of an ant. And unlike in The Crew 1, I get a feeling of traveling in the middle of nowhere much less frequently. Environments are diverse and there is more attention to details. Many opportunities for offroad. It really gives you a sense of freedom when exploring. Big yes.  Loading times: ... loading times? Never heard of that. Seamlessly teleport around the map and change vehichles on the fly. No waiting.  Content: cars? Let's be honest, that's the main reason we play this game for, right? Not just street-legal cars, but also offroad trucks and buggies, rallycross cars, and hypercars. But we ain't got only that. We have boats, planes and hovercrafts at our disposal as well. Which of course are a nice addition, but we're most likely going to spend most of our time in our beloved 4-wheel vehichles (2 wheel if you're into bikes, we got that too). And the game's car park is vast enough as well. Forza by contrast only offers cars... but a much wider selection of them.  Map activities: unlike in The Crew 1, these are not mandatory to grind in order to upgrade your car (which can take a serious amount of time if you're extremely unlycky), but there is only a goal to beat. That's it.  Sound: they're pretty good. That's judging from the Alfa Romeo Giulia, which sounds exactly like its real life counterpart, so I assume other sounds should be faithful to what they're supposed to reproduce.  Car performance upgrades: it's not good but it's still a great improvement from the previous game. Anytime you complete an event, you're guaranteed to receive a car part that's better than those already installed in your cars. And all performance parts are shareable across all vehichles in the same category, without being bound to the specific vehichle you obtained them with. You can potentially use a single high leveled car to obtain performance parts to upgrade all other similar vehichles almost instantly. Still not as good as just buying them with your own money but I'm not complaining...  Soundtrack: I can't describe how much more enjoyable this is compared to The Crew 1. I can finally play more than the only one decent song in the entire songlist.  Story: glad they ditched the story element. The plot in The Crew 1 was poor to say the least and I'd much rather have a generic motorsport event as a context than that. Annnnd this is where it's clear that this game is trying to get close to Forza Horizon. Win, progress across the various rounds of said generic competition, become the champion.  Now, to the ""meh"" parts:  Graphics: they're all but impressive. In fact it looks quite like The Crew 1. Except it even goes backwards. I'd like to know who thought it would be a good idea not to enable users to switch TAA off. The result is that the game looks like it's being run on console, extremely blurry at 1080p, like it was rendered at a lower resolution. While it can be disabled in a settings file, it breaks effects that rely on it, such as reflections. But hey, at least it will look crisp. Overall geometry detail is also mediocre. Oh, and also forced 60 FPS cap. No contest compared to Forza.  AI and difficulty: I'm getting Mario Kart flashbacks.The rubberbanding is just insane. And the difficulty balance across the events is way off. You will see opponents in front of you slowing down to let you pass only to see the same opponents zoom at godlike speeds past you once you're in front. And instead, in the RAID events, the prerecorded ghost is easy to beat, letting me win with a comfortable 40 seconds gap on average using a car with the recommended performance rating for the event.  Physics: better than the previous entry. Cars are still going to be prone to drifting and handbrake will still be useless (sending your car into an almost full stop the moment you press it and steer afterwards) but the driving experience remains overall enjoyable once you get used to it. It just... doesn't feel as natural as Forza.  Disciplines: this games does so many things at once and as a results doesn't shine in anything in particular. But being it arcade-oriented and given what I paid for it, it's not too much of a downside. It still includes and offers way more variety compared to its competitors.  Always-online: as far as I can tell, there is not too much focus on the online element... so why force us to be connected at all times? Folks with unstable internet connections such as myself don't like this you know.  In conclusion: give it a try. Not at a full price, though, or you risk feeling severely disappointed. In fact, I'd much rather pay full price on Forza than this. But overall... it's fun."
43517564,english,0,646910,"Pros: 1. Various race types. Air/Land/Water all in one. 2. Good Car selections.  Cons: 1. Bad controls for cars. Yes, it is arcade, not supposed to be realistic, but I don't really think it should feel like your tires is not sticking to the road. 2. Confusing key mappings. It does not tell you the controls when you got thrown into your first race/demo. The pause menu is not ESC but F10. You cannot have completely separate key binding for vehicles and airplanes. 3. Graphics is all right but could be a lot better. But why there is still a 60-FPS frame limiter? 4. Not really better than The Crew 1, if not worse.  Final Thoughts: If you want to buy this mainly because of car racing, there are many more options better than this one. NFS series for arcade, Forza Horizon for semi-arcade, Assetto Corsa/Project Car 2/Forza Motorsport for simulation side.  P.S. Forza Horizon 4 is coming October, might as well just wait for that one."

136001664,english,1,646910,"[h1] Drive like you stole it! [/h1] The Crew 2 is an open-world racing game developed by Ivory Tower and published by Ubisoft. It was released in 2018 and is a sequel to the original The Crew game. The game allows players to explore a vast open-world recreation of the United States, race against other players online, and collect a variety of vehicles, including cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles.  [h2] Pros and cons [/h2] [table] [tr] [th] 🟩 Positives [/th] [th] 🟥 Negatives [/th] [/tr] [tr] 	[td] - Expansive open-world with a variety of environments to explore  - Impressive level of vehicle customisation  - Wide range of vehicles to collect, including rare and unique ones  - Well-designed vehicle models with realistic handling  - Weekly events and challenges provide a sense of progression and competition  - Impressive graphics and sound design 	[/td] 	[td] - Grindy nature of the game may be off-putting for some players  - Limited storyline and lack of compelling characters  - Some ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits  - Multiplayer PvP mode is limited to simple point-to-point races  - Some bugs and issues with the game, though most have been addressed through updates and patches. 	[/td] [/tr] [/table]	  [h2] Gameplay [/h2] The Crew 2's gameplay is enjoyable and immersive, with a strong emphasis on exploration and racing. The game's expansive open-world allows players to explore various environments, from bustling cities to scenic countryside landscapes. The game's attention to detail is impressive, with realistic handling of the different vehicles and a wide range of customisation options.  [h3] Events [/h3] The game's ""live summits"" events are weekly events where players can win vanity items or time-limited cars. However, some players may struggle to win the top prize without first obtaining cars and parts that give them an advantage. The game's multiplayer PvP mode is a simple race from point A to point B.  [h2] Vehicles [/h2] The game offers rare, unique vehicles not usually found in other racing games. The game's vehicle models are well-designed, and the level of customisation is impressive, allowing players to almost widebody every car. However, some of the game's ""vanities"" can only be obtained through real money or live summits, which may be off-putting for some players.  [h2] Story [/h2] The game's story is minimal, with no clear protagonist or antagonist, and the game focuses more on exploration and racing than storytelling. However, the game's open-world and the various challenges and events provide a sense of progression.  [h2] Graphics and Sound [/h2] The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed vehicle models and environments that look and feel realistic. The game's sound design is also noteworthy, with diverse sound effects adding to the immersive experience.  [h2] Conclusion [/h2] Overall, The Crew 2 is an enjoyable and immersive racing game that offers a vast open-world, a wide range of vehicles, and various events to compete in. The game's attention to detail is impressive, and the vehicle models are well-designed with realistic handling. However, some players may find the game's grindy nature and lack of a compelling story mode to be a turnoff. Nevertheless, The Crew 2 is still a game worth playing for racing fans and those who enjoy exploring and customising their vehicles."
120846641,english,1,646910,"I tried this game when it was free for a weekend, and decided to buy it. It is a very relaxing racing game which I play after office hours.  Positives: - There is a lot of content, and not the usual boring and filler material. So many types of races, including destruction derby, bike races and boats will keep you busy. - It is easy to upgrade cars, you get a lot of materials to upgrade. Live Summit changes every week and provides good rewards so leveling up is easy. - This game has one of the best ways to display the map that I have seen in a racing game.  - On Normal level, it is an easy game, so I play the race on normal and win, then try it on hard (and win again most of the time).   Negatives:  - Ubisoft - In a lot of races, you race against a ghost and there are no other drivers. - Soundtrack is mediocre. Racing games like NFS and Forza have one of the best soundtracks, something you enjoy while driving, but not here. Very okish.  - Graphics are good, but at some places, houses look like boxes.  - Online component is dead.  I also find the plane controls pathetic, although I am not sure if others feel this too.  Overall, it is worth the money. Get the gold edition, so that you have a headstart with extra cars and content."

Hopefully EA is next.

I have finished all of the achievements before writing this review.  Multiplayer arcade race game where you race others with cars, bikes, boats and planes with a full controller support. Characters and story are forgettable, the gameplay though is very fun. If you are looking for realism, this is not a place for you. No police, traffic light changes every 2 sec, no vehicle damage (just scratches), drag cars can reach the speed of almost 700kmh (434mph), if you put side exhaust you will still have rear one.  The game loads once, and you are ready to go! The fast restarts, smooth vehicle swap, travel to challenges etc. Amazing car details and they sound awesome (except motorcycles). Radio offers a variety of different stations so every person can find something for them to listen (and I did not know about it because of a lack of tutorial and guidance in this game). Nevertheless, the world feels empty and lacks some serious gameplay. There is almost no reason to explore the in-game world apart from taking photo opportunities. There are no collectables, few skill games and limitless highlights with top speed, high jump and long drift.   Lots of vehicles, various race types, decent co-op gameplay BUT no PvP. The Crew is all about the PvP and it is not here at launch. ""The Crew 2"" has many of the same cars but in different categories, so if you buy a car in a Street Race category, you can use it for that only compared to the first game.  You can but a Ford Mustang as a Street, Drift, Drag, Track and Monster Truck. And here comes the currency problem. I hate games with microtransactions, but at least here you can play without the urge to spend some real cash. Although the prices are ridiculously high, it is not that hard to grind it out. Performance parts will come as a loot for finishing a race (green, blue, epic and I think legendary will be added with later updates), and it will take a long time to max out a single car because you can get parts with lower performance than what you have. Rare and Epic parts will have 1 and 2 additional modifiers respectively and you can use it to boost your gameplay in many ways.  Car customisation is pretty good but it is limited to the Street Racers Family (Cars with yellow icon) and Monster Trucks. For other classes, you can only change their wheels! You can create your own livery or download one of the popular ones and at least this feature is for all of them.  The game leaves a huge levelling potential (up to 9999) but to be honest there is no reason to do so, because at 600 is your last car reward, and every 10 levels from that point are just epic loot.  Races may vary from short ones up to 40min long with a ""rubber-banding"" difficulty which can be brutal since you will drive at your limits and AI will sometimes push you around and frustrate the hell out of you.  What is a ""Rubber Banding""? - Pushes them towards you if you are far from them and lowers their speed if you are too far behind. So, if you are driving at your and car's limit, the AI (especially 2nd place) will go into hyperspeed to catch up with you. They are not that generous if you fall behind but the AI will still slow down.  Now, I want to speak of things that frustrated me the most - lack of tutorials and a car reset. The game lacks tutorial in some cases! There are so many questions and no clear explanation or indication on how to do some stuff: how to shift a drag car, where is the mailbox when to use two different modes of boats etc. The last one will be verbally explained by one of the characters but if you miss it...   Now, the car resets... It takes 2 FULL seconds to put it back on track and sometimes it will put you WAY back in the race and if you happened to make a mistake in a 40 min long race, you are royally screwed. I was 1st and one small mistake (because the game doesn't show you the raceway like it should) + reset made me the last place with a 10 sec gap to 7th place. I saved the run and finished first but I was at 30% of the race when that happened.  Although I would still recommend this game but not for a full price unless everything I have said above is fine for you. As they did with ""The Crew"" they will add more content in here and it will feel much better to play it but until then, wait for a sale.

43245527,english,1,646910,"I've seen a lot of mixed reviews, I recommend it although it isn't a perfect game.  Some people seem to complain about landmarks and graphics. I find the graphics are great, and i couldn't care less about landmarks.  The MOST important thing to keep in mind, this is an ARCADE STYLE racing game. Not a simulator. If you wanted hyper realism then look elsewhere.  - Great vehicle selection - Good controls - Extensive Customization (you can get lost in it for hours) - Reward vehicles from the previous game - Playing with friends - Larger map area - Larger selection of events to do - More content to come  Here are some flaws (some major)  - Voice acting is ridiculous. No adults speak like these do. - WHERES THE MULTIPLAYER RACES?! (I know, they said they come in December, but most of us bought the game for the MP experience) - Not enough physical damage to vehicles (they seem to have dropped the ""repair"" feature) - Transition from car to boat to plane could have been slightly smoother    Everyone has a different opinion on the game. I'm just being honest. In terms of what I expected out of the game, I got exactly what I wanted... minus the delayed PVP/Multiplayer Racing.  I recommend the game, as long as players remember this is an ARCADE STYLE racing game, and not a simulation."
72413284,english,0,646910,"TL;DR - Ok, it is not that I hate this game, but I just don't recommend it.  For what it is worth, I have fun playing, the customization is nice and the driving feels (for the most part) good. What I have the most issue with is the glitches, minor inconveniences to game breakers. At the time of posting this review, the game literally does not start despite my efforts to get it to do run beyond the title screen. There is also a rather large amount of questionable choices in regards to what you can just blow through and what will crash your vehicle. My last real complaint is the lack of police chases that were present in the first game, while it doesn't exactly fit the ""story,"" it would have been nice to have been included for more incentive to explore and drive around.  Fortunately there is a lot I do like about the game. The car selection is very nice and while I am not the biggest fan of the boat/plane additions, I could see some enjoying the features thoroughly. I also like the Summit activities, which once a week update and always give me something to come back to (while it may be just recycling races from the base game). I also never have felt a need to resort to microtransactions.   In conclusion, I do like this game, after all, there is a reason I have dumped 150+ hours into it, but if you are on the fence, I can only recommend it on a decent sale. Otherwise, Steam offers some NFS games now that may better suit what you may be looking for. Cool game, but a bit lackluster."

94158049,english,1,646910,"What is this game like? A game with a huge world, with an abundant number of vehicles, you can explore not only land, but also air and water. The actions of the game take place in the United States of America, during the game you will have where to turn around, drift, drag, ring races, as well as races all over the map, there will be no borders in front of you. ... You can buy a car of any level, the first good car will not be long in coming. Farming money in the game happens pretty quickly, but it's no less interesting from it. The map shows major cities in the States, as well as their attractions. Simply stunning graphics, effects of water, mud, rain, sun, clouds. Also, during the game you will visit the winter season, the physics of the car will change quite noticeably, which cannot but rejoice. But there are also disadvantages, your car in the game is not titanium, a small tree, like in Forza, will not be able to knock down, when it collides with a stone, it will most likely not stop it, but throw it up. In this game, cars are more like jumpers. I think we will stop at this and will not continue talking about the shortcomings of this game, but talk about the interface and additional functions.  The game has a very simple and beautiful interface, the eye rejoices looking at the picture in the hall. Also, the game is equipped with a photo function, at any moment of movement you can stop the moment and become a real photographer. You will be able to publish your work on the official website of the game.  The game also has character customization, leveling up skills, making a model out of furniture to make everyone envy you.  In conclusion, I want to say that it is a very rich game, its advantages overlap all the disadvantages, many updates have been made to the game, as well as a battle pass, if you are not sure about buying the game, then look at its reviews on the Internet. Thanks for attention !"
43257197,english,0,646910,"Ok, gonna keep this short. Don't buy this game.  With Forza Horizon 4 just around the corner, I'd recommend waiting for that.  This game has a lot of cool ideas and neat features, but is flawed in two MAJOR ways.  1. No person that likes customizing cars wants to get their parts from random loot at the end of races. That's just cringeworthy.  2. The physics are god awful. Turning feels lazy, there is no sense of speed, everything seems to float like GTA IV, and a lot of the control is handled by assists that dont turn off. There ends up being no sense of skill involved in driving.  What the hell good is a racing game about building and racing cars, when the building is largely out of your control, and the driving is completely unsatisfying?   Also, as a nitpick, the game is capped at 60fps, and the car models are pretty damn poor compared to Forza. The lighting model in this game is awesome, thats about it."
108925094,english,1,646910,"If you like racing game, enormous map with all sorts of diversity, many cars with many customisation and regular new events, then this game is definitely for you. Be a fearless racer or just fun chill driver, this game offers me so many things."
